## About Hyperlambda

Hyperlambda is the textual representation of a node structure, where each node has a name, an optional value, and a collection of children nodes. Below is an example.

```hyperlambda
foo:bar
   child1
```

In the above Hyperlambda there is one root node. Its name is "foo", its value is "bar", and this node has one child node, with the name of "child1". Its child node does not have a value, which results in its value being null. The Hyperlambda parser understands "child1" as a child of the "foo" node because it is prefixed by 3 spaces (SP) relative to the "foo" node. This allows you to create graph objects with any depth you wish, by starting out with the number of spaces the node above has, and add 3 additional spaces to declare a child node of the node above.

## Lambda expressions

Lambda expressions are similar to XPath, and allows you to reference any node in the currently executed graph object. Below is an example of Hyperlambda code that changes the value of the [.foo] node to "howdy"

```hyperlambda
.foo
set-value:x:@.foo
   .:howdy
```

When simply needing a static value as an argument such as the above, the convention is to pass in this as a node who's name is simply [.].

An expression is constructed from one or more iterators. This makes an expression become dynamically chained Linq statements, where each iterator reacts upon the results of its previous iterator. Each iterator takes as input an IEnumerable, and returns as its result another IEnumerable, where the content of the iterator somehow reacts upon its given input, according to whatever the particular iterator’s implementation does. This effectively allows us to "filter out" part of the lambda object the current code is executing within, and return 0 or more nodes as a new node-set.

Iterator are separated with a "/" character, and its value defines what it does. For instance the above iterator in the [set-value] invocation, starts out with a `@`. This implies that the iterator will find the first node having a name of whatever follows its "@" part. For the above this implies looking for the first node who’s name is ".foo". Below are all the most common iterators in Magic.

* `*` Retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. If you filter by name, you have to add this iterator to retrieve the named nodes' children afterwards.
* `#` Retrieves the value of its previous result set as a node by reference. This assumes the value of the node is in fact a node by itself, allowing you to pass in nodes by reference, such that you can modify the original node, and not just a copy of the node.
* `-` Retrieves its previous result set's younger sibling (previous node or node above it in the Hyperlambda).
* `+` Retrieves its previous result set's elder siblings (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda).
* `.` Retrieves its previous result set's parent node(s).
* `^xxx` Retrieves the first ancestor node with the specified "xxx" name. Similar to `@` iterator but does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors up in the hierarchy.
* `..` Retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda.
* `**` Retrieves all of its previous result set's descendant nodes, in addition to the node itself from where it starts, with a "breadth first" algorithm.
* `--` Retrieves all ancestors and older siblings upwards in object.
* `!xxx` Retrieves all descendants except those matching specified "xxx" name.
* `{x}` Extrapolated expression that will be evaluated assuming it yields one result, replacing itself with the value of whatever node it points to.
* `=xxx` Retrieves the node with the specified "xxx" value from the previous result set, converting to string if necessary. Only nodes having a **value** of `xxx` will be matched.
* `[n,n]` Retrieves a subset of its previous result set. The first number is from, the second number is number of nodes. To retrieve the first two nodes you can use [0,2]. To retrieve the 4th and 5th node you can use [3,2].
* `@xxx` Returns the first node "before" in its hierarchy that matches the given "xxx" in its name.
* `n` (any number) Returns the n'th child of its previous result set.
* `[x|y]` Pipe separated list of names returning all nodes having a name of either "x" or "y". You can add as many pipes as you wish.

Any iterator not matching the above pattern will be perceived as a "name filter iterator", which will filter out all nodes not having a name matching the value of the iterator. Below is an example:

```hyperlambda
.:x:@.foo/*/bar
```

The above returns all nodes named "bar" that are child nodes of the [.foo] node.

Some of the above iterators might return multiple nodes, except the `#`, `-`, `+`, `.`, `^xxx`, `..`, `@xxx` and `n`. These expressions will *always* return exactly one node!

Below is an example of a lambda expression that checks if the value of the [person] node inside the [.foo] node is equal to "Thomas Hansen", and changes the [.result] node's value to the static value of "Condition is true" if the condition is true.

```hyperlambda
.result
.foo
   person:Thomas Hansen
if
   eq:x:@.foo/*/person
      .:Thomas Hansen
   .lambda
      // Condition is true
      set-value:x:@.result
        .:Condition us true
```

Notice how the `@.foo` iterator will return the [.foo] node, while the `*` iterator will return its children, and finally the `person` iterator will filter out any nodes not having a name of "person" from the previous result set - Resulting in that the above expression returns only the [person] node inside of the [.foo] node, which it compares to the static string value of "Thomas Hansen". Notice, to retrieve children nodes of another node you have to use for instance the `*` iterator or the numbered child iterator `5`, since the name comparison iterator and the value comparison iterators will not visit children, but react upon the result of their previous iterators instead.

Below is an example of a [for-each] loop that iterates through each child node of [.data], and changes their values to "changed".

```hyperlambda
.data
   foo1:bar1
   foo2:bar2
   foo3:bar3
for-each:x:@.data/*
   set-value:x:@.dp/#
      .:changed
```

The above works because of the `#` iterator de-referencing the value of the [.dp] node, and [for-each] automatically having a [.dp] node being the currently iterated node passed in by reference, where the node's value is in fact another node passed in by reference.

Below is another example of an expression:

```hyperlambda
.:x:./*/data.read
```

The above expression has 3 iterators:

1. `.` - Retrieves the current node's parent node
2. `*` - Retrieves all children of the parent node
3. `data.read` filters out all node's who's names are no `data.read`

The above expression basically finds a sibling node named `data.read` at the same level / scope as the current node.

Below is another example:

```hyperlambda
.:x:-/*/context
```

The above contains 3 iterators:

1. `-` - Returns the previous sibling node, implying the node above it at the same indentation.
2. `*` - Returns all its children
3. `context` - Filters out all nodes not having a name of "context".

The above code basically goes one step up in the hierarchy, for then to find the child node of that node named "context".

**IMPORTANT** - An expression might yield zero, one, or multiple resulting nodes. There is no way to determine if a node returns a single node, unless it ends with an iterator that only returns a single node. An expressions are not evaluated before consumed inside for instance a [get-value] invocation or a [set-value] invocation, etc.

Also, iterators can be repeated, such as illustrated below:

```hyperlambda
.:x:+/+/*
```

The above returns all children of the node two nodes further down in the lambda grapho object. This is because the `+` iterator returns the next sibling, and when it's repeated twice as below, it goes to the next node after that node again.

## Your task
 
 I will provide you with one expression. Your objective is to generate a high quality description of the expression explaining what it does, and **RETURN ONLY THE DESCRIPTION**. This description will be used as prompt when fine tuning gpt-41-mini. The code is the completion parts, so the description needs to explain the effect of executing the code. Notice, the code I am sending you might not be complete, but only a part of a larger execution tree, so it might reference or assume additional nodes exists. Have that in mind as you're generating comments.

 **IMPORTANT** - When returning a description, return a numbered list of every iterator sequentially and explain the effect of all iterators.
 
 **IMPORTANT** - RETURN **ONLY** THE HYPERLAMBDA DESCRIPTION. DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE, BESIDES THE DESCRIPTION. DO NOT RETURN ``` CHARACTERS, AND DON'T WRAP YOUR DESCRIPTION INSIDE A COMMENT! ONLY USE INFORMATION TAKEN FROM YOUR CONTEXT, DO NOT MAKE UP FACTS!

**IMPORTANT** - Return node names as [.foo] using square brackets to refer to individual nodes, and also be aware of that the '.' parts of an expression such as `@.arguments/*/foo` implies the name of the node is `.arguments`, and that the name needs to **INCLUDE** the `.` character.
