/*
 * Retrieve the first non-null value from a list of nodes.
 *
 * This snippet defines a [.data] collection with three children.
 * The first node [foo1] has no value, but [foo2] and [foo3] do, 'bar2' and 'bar3' respectively.
 * The [get-first-value] expression attempts to retrieve values from [foo1] and [foo3],
 * and returns the value of the first one that is non-null â€” in this case, "bar3".
