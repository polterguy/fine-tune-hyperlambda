 * And HTTP endpoint taking some piece of content as [content] that it will cryptographically sign using a new RSA private key.
 *
 * Illustrates how to create a new RSA key, for then to immediately use that key to sign some payload, and afterwards verify the signature.
 *
 * Steps:
 * - Creates a new RSA key pair
 * - Use the private key to cryptographically sign the input argument named [content]
 * - Verify the signature using the public key
 * - Return the signed content to caller
