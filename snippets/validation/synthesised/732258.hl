/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [mt] slot to perform a comparison operation.
 * It checks if the value of a specified node is greater than a given static integer value.
 *
 * 1. [.src1]
 *    * An integer node initialized with the value 7.
 *
 * 2. [mt]
 *    * Performs a "more than" comparison between its two child nodes.
 *
 * 3. [get-value]
 *    * Retrieves the value of the [.src1] node for comparison.
 *
 * 4. [.]
 *    * A static integer value of 5 used as the second operand in the comparison.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The [mt] slot will evaluate to true since 7 is greater than 5.
