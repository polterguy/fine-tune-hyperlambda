/*
 * Generate Hyperlambda code that moves a folder from "/source/f" to "/dest/f2".
 * Notice, folder names in Hyperlambda must ALWAYS start with / and end with /.
 * The code uses the [io.folder.move] slot to achieve this.
 * 1. [io.folder.move] - Specifies the source folder path to be moved.
 * 2. [.] - Specifies the destination folder path where the source folder should be moved.
