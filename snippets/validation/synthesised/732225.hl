/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [not] slot to negate a boolean value.
 * The [not] slot is used to invert the truthiness of its single child node, which in this case is a boolean value.
 *
 * 1. [not]
 *    * Takes a single boolean argument and negates its value.
 *    * The child node has a value of true, which will be negated to false.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The [not] slot evaluates to false because it negates the true value of its child node.
