/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to invoke a custom C# signal named "foo".
 * The signal is expected to be defined in a C# class implementing the ISlot interface,
 * allowing it to be triggered from Hyperlambda.
 *
 * 1. [foo]
 *    * Invokes the custom C# signal named "foo".
 *    * The signal is executed, performing whatever logic is defined in its C# implementation.
