/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [not] slot, which negates the boolean value of its argument.
 * In this example, the [not] slot is used to invert a false boolean value to true.
 *
 * 1. [not]
 *    * Takes a single boolean argument and negates its value.
 *
 * 2. [.]:bool:false
 *    * A static boolean value that is false, which the [not] slot will negate.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The [not] slot will evaluate to true because its argument is false.
