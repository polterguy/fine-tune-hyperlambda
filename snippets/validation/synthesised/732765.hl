/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the conversion of a YAML string to a JSON string and then back to YAML.
 *
 * 1. [yaml2json]
 *    * Converts the YAML input specified by the expression to a JSON string.
 *
 * 2. [json2yaml]
 *    * Converts the JSON string obtained from the previous step back to a YAML string.
 *
 * The process ensures that the original YAML structure can be converted to JSON and then reverted back to YAML, maintaining data integrity.
