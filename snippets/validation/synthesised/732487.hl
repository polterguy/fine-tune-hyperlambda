/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to decrement the value of a node by a specified step.
 *
 * 1. [math.decrement]
 *    * Decrements the value of the node specified by its expression.
 *    * The expression points to [.arg], which is the node being decremented.
 *
 * 2. [.]:int:2
 *    * Specifies the step value by which [.arg]'s value is decremented.
 *    * In this case, the value is decremented by 2.
