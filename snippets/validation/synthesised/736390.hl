/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to use the [signal] slot to invoke the "math.add" slot,
 * which performs an addition operation on two integer values.
 *
 * 1. [signal:math.add]
 *    * Invokes the "math.add" slot to perform an addition operation.
 *
 * 2. [a:int:3]
 *    * Specifies the first integer operand for the addition, with a value of 3.
 *
 * 3. [b:int:4]
 *    * Specifies the second integer operand for the addition, with a value of 4.
 *
 * The result of this operation will be the sum of 3 and 4, which is 7.
