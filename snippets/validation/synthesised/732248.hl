/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to seed the cryptographic random number generator (CSRNG) with additional entropy.
 * By invoking the [crypto.seed] slot, you can enhance the unpredictability of the CSRNG used in cryptographic operations.
 *
 * 1. [crypto.seed]
 *    * Seeds the CSRNG with the provided string value to increase its entropy.
 *    * The value "Foo Bar Whatever Some Random Seed" is used as the seed input.
