/*
 * Generate Hyperlambda code that connects to a database, deletes records from a specified table where certain conditions are met, and then closes the connection. The code should use the [data.connect], [data.delete], and [where] slots to achieve this.
 * 1. [data.connect] - Opens a connection to the specified database.
 * 2. [data.delete] - Deletes records from the specified table.
 * 3. [table] - Specifies the table from which records should be deleted.
 * 4. [where] - Defines the conditions that must be met for records to be deleted.
 * 5. [and] - Combines multiple conditions that must all be true for the deletion to occur.
 * 6. [field1] - The first condition field to be matched.
 * 7. [field2] - The second condition field to be matched.
