/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet checks if a static value is equal to a given string.
 *
 * 1. [eq]
 *    * Compares two values for equality.
 *    * The first value is a static string "OK".
 *
 * 2. [.]
 *    * The second value is also a static string "OK".
 *
 * Result:
 * * The [eq] slot will evaluate to true because both values are identical.
