/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the structure of the [eq] slot, which checks for equality between two values.
 * The [eq] slot requires two arguments, the first being the left-hand side (LHS) and the second being the right-hand side (RHS).
 *
 * 1. [eq]
 *    * The main slot invocation that checks if its two child arguments are equal.
 *
 * 2. [.]
 *    * Represents the LHS of the equality check.
 *    * In this example, it is a placeholder named "lhs".
 *
 * 3. [.]
 *    * Represents the RHS of the equality check.
 *    * In this example, it is a placeholder named "rhs".
 *
 * The [eq] slot will return true if the LHS and RHS are exactly the same.
