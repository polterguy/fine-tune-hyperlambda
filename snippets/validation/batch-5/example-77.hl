/*
 * This Hyperlambda file defines an HTTP endpoint that returns a static to-do list.
 * The [.arguments] node signifies it's accessible via HTTP.
 *
 * The [.data] node acts as a container for multiple unnamed [.] child nodes, 
 * which collectively form a **list of tasks**.
 *
 * Each task node includes:
 * - [description]: The task's title.
 * - [completed]: Boolean string ("true"/"false") indicating task status.
 *
 * [yield] is used to return the full list of tasks to the HTTP caller.
 * - [result:x:@.data/*] dynamically selects all tasks under [.data].
 * - [yield] automatically evaluates the expression, returning the result of the `@.data/*` path.
 *
 * The output is a JSON object with a list of tasks under the "result" key.
