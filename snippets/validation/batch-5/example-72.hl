 * Dynamically assembles a Bearer token string from a configuration-based secret.

 * The use of [.auth-token] (note the dot prefix) is **not optional** â€” it prevents the engine 
 * from interpreting [auth-token] as a slot, which would otherwise throw a runtime error.
 *
 * - The [set-value] operation stores the result in [.auth-token].
 * - [strings.concat] builds the final string by appending a value from 
 *   [config.get:"auth:tokens:service-access"] to the prefix "Bearer ".
