/*
 * This endpoint returns a static list of books as a JSON response.
 * The [.arguments] node indicates this is an HTTP endpoint, callable from any client.
 *
 * The [.data] node contains multiple child nodes named [.] â€” each representing a book entry.
 * Each book includes:
 * - [title]: Title of the book.
 * - [author]: Author's name.
 * - [year]: Year of publication.
 *
 * The [yield] slot returns the entire list of book objects.
 * - The node [result:x:@.data/*] selects all anonymous child nodes (.) under [.data].
 * - [yield] evaluates the expression automatically, returning actual node contents.
 * - There's no need to unwrap or resolve the expression manually.
 *
 * The resulting HTTP response will be a JSON array of books.
