/*
 * This Hyperlambda file defines a simple HTTP endpoint that returns a static list of product information.
 * The presence of [.arguments] designates it as an **HTTP-exposed endpoint**, allowing it to be called via HTTP clients.
 *
 * The [.data] node acts as a static in-memory data source containing multiple unnamed child nodes named [.] — 
 * each one representing a single product.
 *
 * Each product includes:
 * - [id]: The product identifier.
 * - [name]: The product name.
 * - [price]: The product price.
 *
 * [yield] is used to return the dataset in the HTTP response.
 * - The node [result:x:@.data/*] selects all child nodes of [.data] using the lambda expression `@.data/*`.
 * - [yield] automatically **evaluates** this expression, meaning it returns actual node values, not references.
 * - No use of [unwrap] is required — [yield] handles it internally.
 *
 * The result is a JSON array of product objects.
