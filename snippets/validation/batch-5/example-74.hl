/*
 * This Hyperlambda file defines a lightweight HTTP endpoint that returns a static list of contact information 
 * (name and phone number) in response to incoming HTTP requests. The presence of the [.arguments] node 
 * marks the file as an **executable HTTP endpoint**, making it callable via HTTP clients such as curl, Postman, 
 * or through frontend code in a web application.
 *
 * The [.data] node defines a simple static dataset:
 * - It contains two unnamed child nodes (each representing an individual contact).
 * - Each contact node includes:
 *   - [name]: The person's name (e.g., "Johnny", "Jane").
 *   - [phone]: The corresponding phone number.
 *
 * The [yield] slot is used to construct and return the HTTP response payload.
 * - The [result:x:@.data/*] node inside [yield] uses an expression to retrieve all child nodes 
 *   under [.data] — effectively fetching the list of contacts.
 * 
 * One of the most important aspects here is that [yield] **automatically evaluates** 
 * all expressions inside of it. This means:
 * - The expression `@.data/*` is evaluated at runtime and replaced with the actual data nodes.
 * - No need to explicitly use [unwrap] or [get-value] — [yield] takes care of it internally.
 *
 * The result is an HTTP JSON response like:
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "result": [
 *     { "name": "Johnny", "phone": "1234567890" },
 *     { "name": "Jane", "phone": "0987654321" }
 *   ]
 * }
 * ```
 * This design is ideal for prototyping static endpoints or returning mock data from an API.
