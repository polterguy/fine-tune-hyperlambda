/*
 * This file defines an HTTP endpoint that returns a static list of locations.
 * The [.arguments] node makes the endpoint available for HTTP invocation.
 *
 * The [.data] node contains multiple anonymous children named [.] â€” each representing a single location.
 *
 * Each location includes:
 * - [city]: Name of the city.
 * - [country]: The country the city is located in.
 *
 * [yield] constructs and returns the final response.
 * - The [result:x:@.data/*] node expression fetches all unnamed children of [.data].
 * - [yield] evaluates this expression automatically, transforming it into actual data nodes in the response.
 *
 * The output is a structured JSON array of locations.
