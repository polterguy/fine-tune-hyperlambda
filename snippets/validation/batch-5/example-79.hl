/*
 * This Hyperlambda endpoint returns a nested graph of starships and their assigned missions 
 * from the 'starfleet' database.
 *
 * Below is a breakdown of the slots and their function:
 *
 * [data.connect]
 * - Establishes a connection to the 'starfleet' database.
 *
 * [data.read] (first)
 * - Reads from the 'Starship' table.
 * - [columns] selects [StarshipID] and [RegistryName].
 * - [where] filters only starships marked as active.
 * - [limit] is set to 5.
 *
 * [include]
 * - Iterates over each starship to retrieve their related missions.
 *
 * [data.read] (nested inside [include])
 * - Queries the 'Mission' table where [StarshipID] matches the current starship.
 *
 * [yield]
 * - Returns the mission list under a [missions] node for each starship.
