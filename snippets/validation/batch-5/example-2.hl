/*
 * This expression locates [foo] nodes that are children of child nodes under the first ancestor node named [.arguments].
 *
 * 1. [@]: The **named iterator**, walks upward to find the first node named [.arguments].
 * 2. [*]: The **wildcard iterator**, selects all direct children of that [.arguments] node.
 * 3. [foo]: The **name iterator**, selects the child node named [foo] from each of those.
 *
 * Result:
 * Returns a node set of all [foo] nodes that are children of the children of the nearest [.arguments] node.
