/*
 * How do I declare a [where] condition for [data.read] that's filtering on name being the same as the [name] argument,
 * OR email being a LIKE SQL condition pointing to the [email] argument, allowing me to filter on name or email,
 * such that EITHER condition needs to be a match to select rows.
 *
 * Return the entire HTTP web API endpoint code, including mandatory validators validating arguments in order of
 * appearance but no other validators, and including the [.arguments] collection. Connect to 'my_db' database and use SQLite to return
 * records from 'contacts' using CRUD slots.
 * Use [yield] to return result to caller as a [contacts] node.
