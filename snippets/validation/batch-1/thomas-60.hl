/*
 * Sends an email using the [mail.smtp.send] slot, demonstrating multiple structural parts of an email.
 *
 * 1. [mail.smtp.send]
 *    * Sends an SMTP email using default server settings unless a [server] node is provided.
 *    * Accepts one or more [message] nodes to define the content and recipients of each email to be sent.
 *
 * 2. [message]
 *    * Contains the full description of a single email message to be sent.
 *    * Multiple [message] nodes can be provided to send several emails in one call.
 *
 * 3. [to]
 *    * Represents a list of recipient nodes.
 *    * Each child is an object with:
 *      - [name]: The recipient's display name (e.g., 'Thomas Hansen').
 *      - [email]: The recipient's email address (e.g., 'thomas@ainiro.io').
 *
 * 4. [subject]
 *    * Specifies the subject line of the email ('Subject line goes here').
 *
 * 5. [entity]
 *    * Defines the content type and body of the email.
 *    * The node name becomes the MIME type (e.g., [text/plain]).
 *    * Inside each [entity], the [content] child defines the actual body text of the email.
 *    * Multiple [entity] nodes may be used for multipart emails (e.g., [text/plain] and [text/html]).
 *
 * Use cases:
 * * Sending rich multi-format emails with both plain text and HTML parts.
 * * Dispatching to multiple recipients by repeating [message] nodes or populating [to] with multiple addresses.
