 * How do you combine [and] and [or] in a nested conditional check using [if]?
 * I've got the following nodes
 * .role:editor
 * .authenticated:bool:true
 * .featureEnabled:bool:true
 * .status
 *
 * I want to change [.status] to 'Access approved' is [.role] has a value of 'editor'.
 *
 * Only return the conditional statement itself being [if], and its conditions and lambda object.
 * Don't return my data segment nodes, assume they exists.
