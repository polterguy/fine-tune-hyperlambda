/*
 * Queries all authors from the [Authors] table in the [library] database,
 * and includes all books written by each author from the [Books] table.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ The [include] construct loops through each author row:
 * - Executes a filtered [data.read] on [Books] using [AuthorId].
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ The [yield] is what binds the inner result to each outer row:
 * - It places the list of books under each author.
 * - Omission would make the join logic ineffective.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Practical for:
 * 1. Catalog UIs showing authors and their publications.
 * 2. Nested API responses (e.g., `/authors?include=books`).
 * 3. Exporting bibliography data structures.
