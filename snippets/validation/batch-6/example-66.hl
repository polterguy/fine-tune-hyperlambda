/*
 * Loads support tickets from the [Tickets] table in the [support] database,
 * filtered by a required ticket [Status.eq] value.
 *
 * ğŸ”¹ Although [Status.eq] is not declared as mandatory, it is
 * **implicitly required** because it is referenced directly within [data.read].
 *
 * - The query will fail without this argument, as no dynamic inclusion logic is present.
 * - The [data.read] filter assumes that [Status.eq] is always supplied.
 *
 * ğŸ”¸ Choose this approach when:
 * 1. The business logic only makes sense with a status filter applied.
 * 2. You want to avoid running unfiltered, full-table scans.
 * 3. You prefer clearly defined input-output behavior without ambiguity.
