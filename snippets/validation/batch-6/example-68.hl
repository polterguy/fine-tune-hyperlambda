/*
 * Retrieves book records from the [Books] table in the [library] database,
 * filtering results based on a partial match of [Title.like].
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Although the argument is not explicitly marked as required using [validators.mandatory],
 * it is still **implicitly mandatory** because it is **directly referenced** in [data.read].
 *
 * This means:
 * - If [Title.like] is not provided by the caller, the expression will break.
 * - There is no logic to skip or dynamically add the filter â€” it must exist.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Use this structure when:
 * 1. You always require a search string to perform filtering.
 * 2. You want to keep the filter logic clear and unambiguous.
 * 3. Optional behavior is not expected â€” the presence of the argument is assumed.
