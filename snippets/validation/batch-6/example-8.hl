/*
 * This Hyperlambda file defines a minimal HTTP endpoint that extracts and logs only 
 * a subset of input arguments — specifically [username] and [age] — before returning 
 * a static success response.
 *
 * [.arguments]
 * - Declares 4 input parameters typically used in a user search query:
 *   - [username]: A string representing the username filter.
 *   - [age]: An integer to filter users by age.
 *   - [status]: User status such as "active" or "inactive".
 *   - [role]: Role filter (e.g., "admin", "user").
 *
 * [add]
 * - A placeholder slot to evaluate the two [get-nodes] invocations.
 * - `+` means the results will be inserted into the node immediately after [add].
 *
 * [get-nodes]
 * - Retrieves only [username] and [age] from [.arguments].
 *
 * [log.info]
 * - Logs just [username] and [age], ignoring [status] and [role].
 *
 * [return]
 * - Responds with a simple success message.
