/*
 * Creates a new book entry in the [Books] table of the [library] database.
 * The [Title] is passed via [.arguments] and merged dynamically at runtime.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ [Title] is an **implicitly optional** argument:
 * - It is not explicitly referenced in [data.create].
 * - It is injected using [add], so if the argument is not provided, it is simply not added.
 * - This allows flexibility â€” the insert will still proceed with default or nullable values.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ [log.info] captures the incoming title for debugging or audit purposes.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ This pattern is ideal for use cases where:
 * 1. You want optional or partial inserts.
 * 2. The table allows null/default values for missing fields.
 * 3. You're building dynamic insert endpoints that vary by use case.
