/*
 * Loads client records from the [Clients] table in the [crm] database and returns the result inline.
 *
 * [yield] is defined **inside** the [data.connect] block, allowing it to directly access sibling nodes like [data.read].
 *
 * ğŸ”¹ The use of `x:@data.read/*` works seamlessly here because:
 * - [yield] shares the same parent as [data.read].
 * - The `@` iterator resolves nodes relative to this shared scope.
 *
 * ğŸ”¸ Best for:
 * 1. Avoiding long path expressions.
 * 2. Keeping database logic and result delivery tightly coupled.
 * 3. Minimizing error-prone references when building modular logic.
