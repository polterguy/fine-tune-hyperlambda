/*
 * Retrieves product entries from the [Products] table in the [inventory] database.
 * Optionally filters results by maximum price using the [Price.lt] argument.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ [Price.lt] is inserted dynamically into the [data.read] query using [add],
 * making it a **non-mandatory** parameter.
 * - If provided, the price condition is added to [where â†’ and].
 * - If not, all products are returned regardless of price.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Advantages of this approach:
 * 1. It avoids hard failures if the filter is missing.
 * 2. It simplifies client integration â€” users can choose whether to filter.
 * 3. It keeps the query logic modular and reusable.
