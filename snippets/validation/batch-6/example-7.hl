/*
 * This Hyperlambda file defines a simple HTTP endpoint that logs a subset of user authentication input — 
 * specifically [username] and [ip_address] — while ignoring other arguments such as [token] and [expires].
 *
 * [.arguments]
 * - Declares four parameters commonly passed to an authentication or login endpoint:
 *   - [username]: The user's login identifier.
 *   - [ip_address]: The IP address of the request origin.
 *   - [token]: A temporary or session token, usually sensitive.
 *   - [expires]: Token expiration timestamp.
 *
 * [log.info]
 * - Logs only [username] and [ip_address] for auditing login attempts.
 * - This helps track request origins without logging sensitive data like tokens.
 * - Arguments are resolved from [.arguments] using expression-based references.
 *
 * [return]
 * - Returns a static [result] node with the value "success" to confirm the request was processed.
 *
 * This logging approach is suitable for:
 * - Security audits without risking sensitive token exposure.
 * - Capturing access context while minimizing data retention.
 * - Supporting compliance in user authentication flows.
