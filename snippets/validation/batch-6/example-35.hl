/*
 * Retrieves student data from the [Students] table in the [school] database.
 *
 * [offset] and [limit] are dynamically added to the query â€” only if provided.
 * This means you can call this endpoint with no parameters and it still works.
 *
 * Ideal for endpoints that serve both full listings and paginated views.
