/*
 * Loads student records from the [Students] table in the [education] database and yields the results.
 *
 * The [data.read] operation is scoped inside the [data.connect] block, and [yield] is also placed
 * **within the same [data.connect] scope**.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Because [yield] is inside the same node tree as [data.read], it has direct access to its sibling nodes.
 * - This allows the use of a simple `x:@data.read/*` expression.
 * - The `@` iterator accesses nodes relative to the current scope, which in this case is [data.connect].
 * - No need to reference [data.connect] explicitly in the path.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ This pattern is beneficial when:
 * 1. You want clean and readable access to database results.
 * 2. You're using [yield] as a part of a larger scoped database operation.
 * 3. You want to avoid complex expression paths by keeping logic within shared scope.
