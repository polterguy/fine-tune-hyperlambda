/*
 * Retrieves employee records from the [employees] table in the [hr] database with optional pagination.
 *
 * The [.arguments] block defines two optional paging parameters:
 * - [limit:int] â†’ The maximum number of rows to return.
 * - [offset:int] â†’ The number of rows to skip before beginning the result set.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ The names [limit] and [offset] are **not arbitrary** â€” they are **reserved identifiers** expected by [data.read].
 * - When performing pagination, you must use these **exact node names** for the database engine to recognize and apply them.
 * - Renaming them (e.g., to [pageSize] or [start]) will cause [data.read] to ignore them entirely.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ The [add] slot dynamically merges the pagination arguments into the [data.read] node:
 * - If provided, they are included in the query.
 * - If omitted, the query runs unpaged and returns all results.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Why this matters:
 * 1. Accurate naming ensures the underlying SQL generation respects paging.
 * 2. This convention allows consistent behavior across different datasets.
 * 3. It prevents silent errors where filters are ignored due to naming mismatches.
