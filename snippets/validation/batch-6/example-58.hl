/*
 * Retrieves all product entries from the [Products] table in the [inventory] database and returns them.
 *
 * Both [data.read] and [yield] are scoped inside the same [data.connect] block,
 * allowing [yield] to directly reference [data.read] using the `@` iterator.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Since they're within the same logical scope:
 * - The expression `x:@data.read/*` works without needing to reference [data.connect].
 * - This keeps the code clean, readable, and avoids redundant traversal.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Use when:
 * 1. You want to return query results immediately from within a DB connection.
 * 2. The [yield] logic depends directly on DB output.
 * 3. You're maintaining tight, scoped workflows for easier reasoning.
