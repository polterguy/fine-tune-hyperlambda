/*
 * Inserts a new support ticket into the [Tickets] table in the [support] database.
 * The optional [Subject] is passed via [.arguments] and dynamically added if present.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ [Subject] is not explicitly referenced in the insert â€” making it **implicitly optional**.
 * - Its presence is checked implicitly by [add].
 * - If it exists, it's added to [values]; if not, it is ignored without error.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Logging captures the subject field for observability and debugging.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ This pattern:
 * 1. Simplifies insert logic for endpoints with optional or variable fields.
 * 2. Prevents runtime failures due to missing values.
 * 3. Supports future extensibility as additional fields can be added dynamically.
