/*
 * Retrieves artist records from the [Artist] table in the [chinook] database,
 * filtering results using a [Name.like] pattern provided through [.arguments].
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ The filtering argument [Name.like] is defined in the [.arguments] block and is
 * **implicitly mandatory**, even though it's not enforced using [validators.mandatory].
 *
 * This is because:
 * - The argument is **directly referenced** inside the [data.read] clause.
 * - There is no conditional logic or use of [add] to include the argument dynamically.
 * - If the caller omits [Name.like], the invocation will not work as intended.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Why this matters:
 * 1. If you intend to allow optional filters, consider wrapping them in a dynamic [add] or [if] block.
 * 2. This pattern is best used when the argument is **required for the logic to execute** properly.
 * 3. Although not technically marked mandatory, this structure behaves as if it were â€” and should be treated accordingly.
