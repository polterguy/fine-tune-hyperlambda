/*
 * Retrieves product data from the [Products] table in the [inventory] database and returns it.
 *
 * The [data.connect] block performs the database operations, with [data.read] selecting all products.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Since [yield] is declared **outside** the [data.connect] scope:
 * - It cannot directly access [data.read].
 * - The expression must begin with [data.connect].
 * - This full path ensures [yield] references the correct node after [data.connect] has executed.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Recommended when:
 * 1. You want to isolate DB logic from output handling.
 * 2. You plan to reuse or inspect values between blocks.
 * 3. You want clean separation of data access and response layers.
