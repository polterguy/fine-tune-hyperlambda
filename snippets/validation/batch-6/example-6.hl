/*
 * This Hyperlambda file defines a minimal HTTP endpoint that extracts and logs only 
 * a subset of input arguments — specifically [limit] and [offset] — before returning 
 * a static success response.
 *
 * [.arguments]
 * - Declares 4 common input parameters typically used for pagination and sorting:
 *   - [limit]: Maximum number of records to return.
 *   - [offset]: Number of records to skip from the beginning of the dataset.
 *   - [order]: A string to indicate which field to sort on.
 *   - [direction]: Sorting direction (e.g., "asc" or "desc").
 *
 * [add]
 * - A placeholder slot that serves to evaluate child nodes beneath it.
 * - The target path `x:+` means the results will be inserted into the **next sibling node** after [add].
 *
 * [get-nodes]
 * - Two invocations are used to selectively retrieve [limit] and [offset] from [.arguments].
 * - Only these two parameters are evaluated and passed forward into the following operation.
 *
 * [log.info]
 * - Logs only [limit] and [offset], ignoring the remaining parameters.
 * - This is useful when you only care about a subset of arguments for observability or diagnostics.
 *
 * [return]
 * - Sends back a [result] node with the string "success", confirming the endpoint executed successfully.
 *
 * This snippet is useful for:
 * - Demonstrating selective argument extraction.
 * - Logging partial data in controlled logging environments.
 * - Performing lightweight operations using only relevant parameters.
