/*
 * Retrieves all customers from the [Customers] table in the [ecommerce] database,
 * and includes all related orders from the [Orders] table for each customer.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ [include] loops over each customer record:
 * - Executes a nested [data.read] for each customer, filtering [Orders] by [CustomerId].
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ The [yield] is essential inside [include]:
 * - It binds the retrieved orders to the parent customer.
 * - Without it, the inner query runs but its result is discarded.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Recommended when:
 * 1. Building customer profiles with order history.
 * 2. Producing expandable frontend UIs with nested data.
 * 3. Structuring multi-entity API responses efficiently.
