/*
 * Registers a new student in the [Students] table in the [school] database.
 * The optional [FullName] argument is dynamically injected during creation if present.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ [FullName] is an **implicitly optional** input:
 * - The [data.create] node does not reference it directly.
 * - [add] checks whether the field exists in [.arguments], and adds it only if present.
 * - This prevents errors and allows null or default values to take effect.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ [log.info] logs the received full name for transparency and debugging.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ This pattern is great for:
 * 1. Building flexible enrollment APIs.
 * 2. Supporting draft/incomplete student registrations.
 * 3. Minimizing strict schema coupling in logic.
