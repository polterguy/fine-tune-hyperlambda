/*
 * Determines font MIME type based on extension using [strings.split] and a [switch] lookup.
 *
 * This works by breaking the string [.fontFile] into segments using '.' as a delimiter,
 * then using the `0/-` iterator pattern to reliably roundtrip back to the **last** segment â€” the extension.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Why `0/-` is key:
 * - `0` accesses the first child of the split list.
 * - `-` moves to the last sibling, effectively giving you the final extension without needing to count nodes.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Use cases:
 * 1. Setting correct MIME types in web fonts for HTTP headers.
 * 2. Validating uploaded font formats.
 * 3. Grouping fonts by family/engine in asset pipelines.
