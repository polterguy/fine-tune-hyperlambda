/*
 * Queries book records from the [Books] table in the [library] database and yields them from within the same context.
 *
 * Since both [data.read] and [yield] are placed inside [data.connect], the `@` iterator can be used to access results directly.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ This works because:
 * - The [yield] statement can resolve [data.read] as a sibling within its parent scope.
 * - No need to include the full reference path like [data.connect/*].
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Use cases:
 * 1. Returning DB records immediately within a single database connection block.
 * 2. Simplifying node traversal for inline responses.
 * 3. Preserving performance and clarity in tight, scoped logic.
