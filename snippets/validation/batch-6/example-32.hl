/*
 * Fetches customer records from the [Customers] table in the [crm] system.
 *
 * The [offset] and [limit] values are included only if supplied by the caller.
 * This is enabled through [get-nodes] and [add], meaning pagination is not required to run the query.
 *
 * Useful for general-purpose CRM data endpoints with auto-fallback to "return all."
