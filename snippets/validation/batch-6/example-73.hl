/*
 * Retrieves client records from the [Clients] table in the [crm] database.
 * Optionally filters the results by country using the [Country.eq] argument.
 *
 * ğŸ”¹ The filter condition is **dynamically injected** into the [data.read] query using [add].
 * - This makes [Country.eq] an optional argument.
 * - If it's present, the condition is applied under [where â†’ and].
 * - If omitted, no filtering occurs, and all client records are returned.
 *
 * ğŸ”¸ This pattern is beneficial when:
 * 1. You want flexible filters that don't require fallback logic.
 * 2. Your queries should support both narrow and broad results.
 * 3. You want to avoid validation errors on unused filters.
