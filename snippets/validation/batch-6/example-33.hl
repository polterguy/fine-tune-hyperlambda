/*
 * Returns album records from the [Albums] table inside the [music] database.
 *
 * This endpoint supports pagination through [offset] and [limit], but they are not mandatory.
 * Since the values are pulled dynamically into [data.read], the operation works with or without them.
 *
 * Itâ€™s a smart pattern that simplifies logic and enhances endpoint reusability.
