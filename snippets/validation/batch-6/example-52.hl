/*
 * Loads artist records from the [Artist] table in the [chinook] database and returns them to the caller.
 *
 * The [data.connect] block handles the actual database interaction, where [data.read] is used to select all rows.
 * 
 * ðŸ”¹ Notice that [yield] is placed **outside** the scope of [data.connect].
 * - This means it does **not have direct access** to the inner [data.read] node.
 * - To retrieve the result, [yield] must traverse from the root through [data.connect] to [data.read].
 * - This is why the expression is referencing [data.connect] first.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Use this structure when:
 * 1. You need to access database output after the connection has closed.
 * 2. You're separating data access from return logic for clarity.
 * 3. You want to return multiple values, only some of which are generated inside [data.connect].
