/*
 * Retrieves music tracks from the [Tracks] table in the [media] database.
 * Optionally filters tracks by minimum duration using the [Duration.gt] argument.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ The [add] slot is used to dynamically insert the filter into [where â†’ and],
 * ensuring [Duration.gt] is **only included if present**.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Why this matters:
 * 1. Avoids enforcing filters that may not always be relevant.
 * 2. Supports full listings and filtered results with a single logic block.
 * 3. Reduces redundancy and avoids unnecessary [if] or [exists] checks.
