/*
 * Queries the [Students] table from the [education] database and returns the full result set.

 * Database access occurs inside [data.connect], and the actual selection happens via [data.read].
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Since [yield] is located **outside** the [data.connect] block:
 * - It must include the entire path to access the [data.read] results.
 * - This is why the expression references [data.connect] first.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Choose this pattern when:
 * 1. You are formatting or combining multiple results at the root level.
 * 2. Your logic uses modular or layered node structures.
 * 3. You want to preserve readable separation between query and output.
