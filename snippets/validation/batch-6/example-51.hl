/*
 * Pulls delivery records from the [Deliveries] table in the [logistics] database.
 *
 * The [data.read] operation is wrapped inside [data.connect], isolating the DB logic from the return statement.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Because [yield] is placed **after** [data.connect], not nested within it:
 * - It must reference the full path to [data.read].
 * - Hence, the expression begins with [data.connect] and drills into [data.read].
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Best used when:
 * 1. You structure your workflows into logical blocks.
 * 2. You want to conditionally yield values after DB execution.
 * 3. You anticipate additional processing or branching post-query.
