/*
 * Extracts the file extension from the given [.path] value using a two-step split operation.
 *
 * This pattern is useful when you:
 * 1. Need to determine the file type before processing.
 * 2. Want to validate uploads by file extension.
 * 3. Dynamically route files to parsers based on their type (e.g. '.json', '.hl').
 * 4. Display file icons based on extension in a UI list.
 *
 * The split on '/' isolates path segments, and the `-` iterator retrieves the last segment,
 * which is then split again by '.', and the last value retrieved gives us the extension.
