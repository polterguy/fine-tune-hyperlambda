/*
 * This Hyperlambda file defines a basic HTTP endpoint that selectively logs 
 * a subset of incoming arguments — specifically [order] and [direction] — 
 * which are commonly used for sorting query results.
 *
 * [.arguments]
 * - Declares four standard parameters typically used for pagination and sorting:
 *   - [limit]: Maximum number of items to return.
 *   - [offset]: Number of items to skip (starting position).
 *   - [order]: Field name to order results by.
 *   - [direction]: Sorting direction (e.g., "asc" or "desc").
 *
 * [log.info]
 * - Logs only [order] and [direction] to the system's logging mechanism.
 * - This is useful for tracking how clients are querying or sorting data 
 *   without exposing all arguments unnecessarily.
 * - [order] and [direction] are dynamically resolved using expressions, 
 *   referencing their values directly from [.arguments].
 *
 * [return]
 * - Returns a simple [result] node containing the string "success", 
 *   confirming that the endpoint executed without error.
 *
 * This pattern is ideal for:
 * - Selective logging of sensitive or audit-critical arguments.
 * - Observability into client-side query patterns.
 * - Lightweight server-side diagnostics.
