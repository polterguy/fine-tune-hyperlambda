/*
 * Adds a new customer to the [Customers] table in the [sales] database.
 * The [Email] is supplied optionally and injected only if present.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ [Email] is considered **implicitly optional** because:
 * - It is not used directly in the [data.create] block.
 * - It is conditionally merged using [add] and [get-nodes].
 * - If omitted, no error occurs â€” only existing input is applied.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ The email is logged using [log.info] for traceability.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Best used when:
 * 1. Creating flexible inserts for optional contact fields.
 * 2. Working with partially completed registration flows.
 * 3. Supporting extensible input without code changes.
