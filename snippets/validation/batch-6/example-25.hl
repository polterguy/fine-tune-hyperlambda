/*
 * Determines the scripting language of a file using [strings.split] and [switch].
 *
 * The [.scriptFile] holds the name of a script. [strings.split] isolates its extension,
 * and the `0/-` iterator pair ensures the **last** value is always selected â€” even with
 * compound file names (e.g., `setup.dev.sh` still resolves to `sh`).
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Why this technique matters:
 * - `0` targets the root of the split result.
 * - `-` jumps backward to reach the last sibling node, even when starting at the beginning.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Use cases:
 * 1. Syntax highlighting in custom IDEs.
 * 2. Auto-detecting interpreters for task runners.
 * 3. Logging or filtering based on script types.
