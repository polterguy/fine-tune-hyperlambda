/*
 * Retrieves student records from the [Students] table in the [school] database,
 * filtering to include only those with a grade greater than a specified value.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ The filtering argument [Grade.gt] is **implicitly required**,
 * because it is directly embedded in the [data.read] filter clause.
 *
 * - There is no fallback logic or dynamic [add] to bypass or include it conditionally.
 * - If the caller does not supply it, the query will error or return no results.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Useful when:
 * 1. You want to enforce performance-friendly filtered queries.
 * 2. A minimum grade is required to validate access to the endpoint.
 * 3. You expect tight coupling between query inputs and logic.
