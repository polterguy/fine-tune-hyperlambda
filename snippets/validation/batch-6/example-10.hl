/*
 * This Hyperlambda file defines an HTTP endpoint that logs selected search-related arguments — 
 * specifically [query] and [tags] — which are typically used for filtering content in search APIs.
 *
 * [.arguments]
 * - Declares four parameters relevant to search operations:
 *   - [query]: The search string input from the user.
 *   - [tags]: A comma-separated list of tags to filter results.
 *   - [sort_by]: The field used for sorting search results.
 *   - [page]: The page number in a paginated result set.
 *
 * [log.info]
 * - Logs only [query] and [tags], omitting other parameters.
 * - Useful for analyzing user intent and commonly searched topics.
 * - [query] and [tags] are resolved from [.arguments] using expressions.
 *
 * [return]
 * - Returns a [result] node containing the string "success", indicating the request completed successfully.
 *
 * This pattern supports:
 * - Partial logging of high-interest user input for analytics.
 * - Lightweight observability in search-related API endpoints.
 * - Minimal exposure of irrelevant or sensitive metadata.
