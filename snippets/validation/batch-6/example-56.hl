/*
 * Pulls all order entries from the [Orders] table in the [sales] database.
 *
 * The [yield] node is placed directly within the [data.connect] block,
 * which gives it direct, relative access to [data.read] using the `@` iterator.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Why this matters:
 * - Because they share the same scope, `x:@data.read/*` retrieves the output without complex traversal.
 * - It reduces code verbosity while improving readability and correctness.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Ideal when:
 * 1. You keep the data retrieval and response tightly scoped.
 * 2. Youâ€™re creating reusable DB interaction snippets.
 * 3. You aim to reduce fragility in expression paths.
