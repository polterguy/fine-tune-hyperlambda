/*
 * Fetches product records from the [Products] table in the [inventory] database,
 * filtered by a required [Category.eq] value.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Even though [Category.eq] is not marked as required using a validator,
 * it is **implicitly mandatory** because [data.read] directly references it.
 *
 * This structure assumes:
 * - The caller **must** supply the argument.
 * - If omitted, the query will fail or produce no results due to unresolved references.
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ This pattern is appropriate when:
 * 1. A filter is essential to the business logic (e.g., scoped product views).
 * 2. You want deterministic and narrow queries.
 * 3. The endpoint is designed to work only with a valid category context.
