/*
 * Loads all students from the [Students] table in the [school] database, and for each student,
 * retrieves their related grade entries from the [Grades] table.
 *
 * ğŸ”¹ The [include] slot effectively behaves like a **loop**:
 * - It runs once per student row returned by the outer [data.read].
 * - For each student, a second [data.read] is performed on [Grades] using that student's [StudentId].
 *
 * ğŸ”¹ The [yield] inside [include] is **critical**:
 * - It attaches the result of the inner query (grades) to the corresponding student.
 * - Without it, the retrieved grades would not be included in the final structure.
 *
 * ğŸ”¸ Use when:
 * 1. You need nested relational output (e.g., student â†’ grades).
 * 2. You're generating a joined data view for reports or APIs.
 * 3. You want to avoid manually merging data sets after retrieval.
