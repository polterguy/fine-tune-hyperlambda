/*
 * Loads client records from the [Clients] table in the [crm] database.
 *
 * The actual query is performed inside [data.connect], where [data.read] fetches all client rows.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Because [yield] is declared **after** [data.connect], and not within its block:
 * - It must use a full path to reach [data.read].
 *
 * ðŸ”¸ Scenarios where this structure is helpful:
 * 1. Creating reusable logic blocks with shared output patterns.
 * 2. Returning DB results alongside other top-level values.
 * 3. Maintaining clarity by keeping return logic external.
