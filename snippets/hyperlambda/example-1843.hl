// How the named ancestor node works
.data:value
get-value:x:@.data

/*
 * The above named ancestor iterator traverses the node hierarchy from the identity node and upwards,
 * until it finds a node with the name specified. In the example above the name is `.data`.
 *
 * After execution, the value of the [get-value] slot will become 'value'
