/*
 * This Hyperlambda file defines an HTTP endpoint returning classes and their enrolled students 
 * from the 'school' database in a graph-style format.
 *
 * Below is a breakdown of the slots and their function:
 *
 * [data.connect]
 * - Opens a connection to the 'school' database.
 *
 * [data.read] (first)
 * - Selects from the 'Class' table.
 * - Filters classes for grade level "10".
 * - Limits to 4 classes.
 *
 * [include]
 * - Iterates over each class to retrieve related student records.
 *
 * [data.read] (nested inside [include])
 * - Queries the 'Student' table using the [ClassID] as foreign key.
 *
 * [yield]
 * - Returns the students as a nested [students] array under each class.
