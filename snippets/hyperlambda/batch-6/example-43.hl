/*
 * This block dynamically creates a Bearer token string used for authorization,
 * by combining the "Bearer " scheme prefix with a secret value retrieved from the configuration system.
 *
 * - The [.key] node acts as a container for the final Bearer token.
 *
 * - The [set-value] slot assigns the resulting token string to [.key].
 *
 * - Inside [set-value], [strings.concat] is used to concatenate two string values:
 *   1. A literal string `"Bearer "` — the standard prefix required for Bearer token-based HTTP authorization headers.
 *   2. The result of [config.get:"magic:netsuite:consumer-key"] — which reads the configured consumer key 
 *      for the NetSuite integration from the application's configuration system, using the hierarchical key path 
 *      'magic:netsuite:consumer-key'.
 *
 * The result is a correctly formatted Bearer token (e.g., "Bearer abc123") stored in [.key],
 * which can then be used in HTTP headers for secure API requests.
