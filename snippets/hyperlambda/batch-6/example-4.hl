 * Demonstrates how to append a new movie title to an existing [watchlist] using the [add] slot.
 *
 * The [.watchlist] node contains an array of movies, and we dynamically insert "Inception" as an additional entry.
 * The use of unnamed child nodes ensures the list remains simple and flatâ€”ideal for frontends or APIs expecting arrays.
