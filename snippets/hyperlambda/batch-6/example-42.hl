/*
 * Prepares a Bearer token for HTTP Authorization by concatenating a static prefix 
 * with a config-sourced credential.
 *
 * [.header-value] is a local node, NOT a slot â€” and the leading "." ensures the execution 
 * engine treats it that way. Without the dot, the system would look for a [header-value] slot, 
 * fail to find it, and raise an exception.
 *
 * - [strings.concat] joins:
 *   1. The literal "Bearer ".
 *   2. A secret string retrieved from [config.get:"gateway:auth:integration-key"].
 *
 * - [set-value] stores the result in [.header-value] for later use.
