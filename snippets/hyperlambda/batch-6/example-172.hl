/*
 * This Hyperlambda file converts a string-formatted monetary value into a [double] (floating-point) number.
 *
 * [.price]
 * - Contains the string "49.95", simulating a user-supplied or configuration-defined price value.
 * - By default, all values in Hyperlambda are treated as strings unless converted.
 *
 * [set-value]
 * - Updates [.price] with the converted float value, enabling numerical operations like tax calculations or rounding.
 *
 * [convert]
 * - Uses [type:double] to convert the value into a floating-point type.
 * - [double] supports decimal precision, making it ideal for monetary values.
