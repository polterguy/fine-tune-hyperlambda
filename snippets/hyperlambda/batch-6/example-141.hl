/*
 * This Hyperlambda file defines a simple HTTP endpoint that returns a structured [result] object
 * containing both a [status] and [message] node.
 *
 * [.arguments]
 * - Declares the file as an executable HTTP endpoint.
 * - No arguments are defined here, but this structure allows the endpoint to be extended in the future.
 *
 * [return]
 * - Returns a [result] container with two fields:
 *   - [status]: A string indicating the operation outcome (e.g. "success").
 *   - [message]: A human-readable message describing the result.
 * - This response format is well-suited for REST APIs where a consistent and expressive result payload
 *   helps frontend clients and third-party integrations interpret the response clearly.
 *
 * Example JSON response:
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "result": {
 *     "status": "success",
 *     "message": "Operation completed successfully"
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
