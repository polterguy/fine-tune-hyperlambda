/*
 * This Hyperlambda file dynamically selects and invokes a slot based on runtime arguments.
 * It's a powerful demonstration of how Hyperlambda supports reflective execution.
 *
 * [.arguments]
 * - [operation]: Slot name to invoke (e.g., "math.increment").
 * - [value]: Argument passed to the dynamic slot.
 *
 * [set-name]
 * - Renames [perform] to whatever is passed as [operation], allowing dynamic slot execution.
 *
 * [perform]
 * - Placeholder node that becomes the actual slot based on [operation].
 * - Receives the [value] argument for execution.
 *
 * [yield]
 * - Returns the result from the renamed slot, resolved dynamically using extrapolated slot name syntax.
