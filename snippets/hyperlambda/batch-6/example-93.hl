/*
 * This Hyperlambda file demonstrates how to issue an [http.delete] request to revoke an API key.
 * It includes custom tracking headers and dynamic query parameters.
 *
 * [.api_key] and [.user_id] are dynamically injected into the query and header structures.
 *
 * [query]
 * - [action]: Describes the type of deletion ("revoke").
 * - [key]: Injects the API key dynamically.
 * - [user]: Injects the user ID dynamically.
 *
 * [headers]
 * - [X-Trace-ID]: Used for request tracking/debugging.
 * - [X-App-Version]: Static header to indicate the client version.
 * - [Authorization]: A mock token for secure DELETE requests.
