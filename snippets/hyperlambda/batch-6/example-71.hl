/*
 * This Hyperlambda file demonstrates how to perform an HTTP GET request with shipping-related 
 * query parameters using the [http.get] slot and the public diagnostic API at https://httpbin.org/get.
 *
 * [.endpoint]
 * - Stores the base URL for the request, pointing to httpbin.org’s /get endpoint for testing.
 *
 * [http.get]
 * - Sends the GET request to [.endpoint].
 * - [convert] is set to [true] to automatically convert the returned JSON into a lambda node tree.
 *
 * [query]
 * - Appends query string parameters for a hypothetical shipping request:
 *   - [tracking_id]: Simulates a parcel tracking number.
 *   - [carrier]: Represents the shipping company used.
 * - These parameters will appear in the request as 
 *   `?tracking_id=XYZ123&carrier=UPS`.
 *
 * The response’s [content] structure will echo back these parameters under the [args] node,
 * making this ideal for testing outbound query construction.
