/*
 * This Hyperlambda file demonstrates how to perform an HTTP POST request with a JSON payload 
 * containing a list of political candidates, each represented as an object with a [name] and [party].
 *
 * [http.post]
 * - Issues a POST request to https://httpbin.org/post — a public HTTP test service.
 * - [convert:true] ensures the response JSON is parsed into a Hyperlambda-compatible structure.
 *
 * [query]
 * - Appends a static [election] parameter to simulate passing context or filters via the URL.
 *
 * [payload]
 * - Contains a [candidates] node, which holds a list of unnamed objects ([.]).
 * - Each object represents a candidate with:
 *   - [name]: The candidate’s full name.
 *   - [party]: Their affiliated political party.
 * - This structure is serialized into a proper JSON array, making it suitable for bulk transmission.
