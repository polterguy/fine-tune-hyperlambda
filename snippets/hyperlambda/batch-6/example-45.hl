/*
 * Constructs a Bearer token by prefixing a configured credential with "Bearer ".
 *
 * The [.session-token] node uses a leading "." to declare it as a **data node**, 
 * NOT a slot. Without this prefix, the execution engine would incorrectly attempt 
 * to invoke [session-token] as a slot — which does not exist — resulting in a fatal error.
 *
 * - [set-value] assigns the concatenated result to [.session-token].
 * - [strings.concat] joins:
 *   1. The static string `"Bearer "`.
 *   2. A secure token retrieved from [config.get:"security:session:api-token"].
