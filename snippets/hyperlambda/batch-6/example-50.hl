 *
 * [data.read] (first)
 * - Reads from the 'Warehouse' table.
 * - [columns] selects [WarehouseID] and [Location].
 * - [where] filters warehouses located in "New York".
 * - [limit] is set to 2.
 *
 * [include]
 * - Executes for each warehouse.
 *
 * [data.read] (nested inside [include])
 * - Retrieves items from 'StockItem' for each warehouse by [WarehouseID].
 *
 * [yield]
