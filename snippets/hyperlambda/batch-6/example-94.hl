/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet shows how to route and invoke logic dynamically using slot names passed at runtime.
 * It's a practical use of Hyperlambda's reflection model for generic routing engines or function pipelines.
 *
 * [.arguments]
 * - [handler]: Defines the slot to be invoked dynamically.
 * - [data]: Input value that will be passed into the selected slot.
 *
 * [set-name]
 * - Dynamically renames the [invoke] node to match the slot defined in [handler].
 *
 * [invoke]
 * - Will be transformed into the desired slot.
 * - Takes [data] as its only argument, allowing full slot substitution at runtime.
 *
 * [yield]
 * - Returns the result of the dynamically resolved and executed slot using extrapolated resolution.
