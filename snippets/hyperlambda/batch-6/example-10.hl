/*
 * This example merges two movie collections using [add] and [get-nodes].
 *
 * 1. The [.favorites] node contains a list of favorite films:
 *    - "The Matrix"
 *    - "Inception"
 *    - "Interstellar"
 *
 * 2. The [.more-favorites] node holds more titles to add:
 *    - "Blade Runner"
 *    - "Dune"
 *
 * 3. [get-nodes] gathers the children of [.more-favorites], and [add] appends them into [.favorites].
 *
 * This is a great technique for merging user preferences from different sources such as profiles, history, or session data.
