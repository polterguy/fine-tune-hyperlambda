/*
 * This Hyperlambda file defines a basic HTTP endpoint structure that responds with a custom [status] message.
 *
 * [.arguments]
 * - Declares the file as a callable HTTP endpoint.
 * - Although no specific arguments are defined, this allows the endpoint to evolve while still being valid.
 *
 * [return]
 * - Returns a [status] node with the value "ok".
 * - The use of a status field provides clarity and flexibility in expressing the outcome of the request.
 * - This format is often used in lightweight monitoring, internal diagnostics, or stub endpoints.
