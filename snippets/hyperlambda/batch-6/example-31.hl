/*
 * This snippet demonstrates how to append multiple city names to an existing list using the [add] slot.
 *
 * 1. The [.travel] node is initialized as a flat list with two unnamed child nodes ([.]):
 *    - "Oslo"
 *    - "Paris"
 *
 * 2. The [add] slot uses [x:@.travel] as its target, meaning new cities will be inserted into this list.
 *
 * 3. The new values to append are grouped under another [.] node:
 *    - "Tokyo"
 *    - "New York"
 *    - "Lisbon"
 *
 * 4. The resulting [.travel] list will include five cities in total, all represented as unnamed list items.
 *
 * This approach is useful for dynamically enriching a destination list with supplemental values.
