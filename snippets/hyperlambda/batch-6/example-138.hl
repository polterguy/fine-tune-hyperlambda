/*
 * This Hyperlambda file returns a list of products from the 'inventory' database,
 * optionally filtered by [category.eq] and [price.lt].
 *
 * Both arguments are passed through an [add] operation to dynamically decorate the 
 * [data.read] invocation. This ensures these parameters are **OPTIONAL** â€” if they are 
 * not provided, they won't affect the SQL logic.
 *
 * This structure keeps your endpoint flexible and clean while enabling precise filtering.
