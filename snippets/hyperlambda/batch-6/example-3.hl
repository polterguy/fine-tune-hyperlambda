/*
 * This example shows how to use the [add] slot to append a new city to an existing list of travel destinations.
 *
 * The [.cities] node starts with a list of unnamed nodes representing city names.
 * [add] inserts a new unnamed node with the value "Lisbon" at the end of this list.
 *
 * This technique is ideal for building or expanding dynamic arrays such as user itineraries or location preferences.
