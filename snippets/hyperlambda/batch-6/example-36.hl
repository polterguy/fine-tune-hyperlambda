/*
 * This snippet uses the [for-each] and [add] slots to append metadata to a list of device objects.
 *
 * 1. The [.devices] node is a list of unnamed nodes ([.]) with each representing a hardware item:
 *    - [model]: the device model
 *    - [brand]: the manufacturer
 *
 * 2. The [for-each] slot iterates through each entry using [x:@.devices/*].
 *
 * 3. The [add] slot adds a new [warranty] field with a value of "2 years" to each device.
 *
 * This is useful for enriching device registries or generating structured output for APIs or exports.
