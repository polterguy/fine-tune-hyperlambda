/*
 * This Hyperlambda file applies conditional enrichment to a static list of flowers 
 * by assigning a [bloom_type] based on their [bloom_time] value.
 *
 * The [.flowers] node contains unnamed entries representing individual flowers.
 * Each flower has:
 * - [name]: The name of the flower.
 * - [bloom_time]: The number of days it takes to bloom.
 *
 * [include] iterates over each flower node and conditionally adds a [bloom_type] node.
 * - If [bloom_time] is greater than 60 days, the flower is marked as "Late Bloomer".
 * - Otherwise, it's labeled as "Early Bloomer".
