 * The [.vegetables] node includes unnamed entries, each representing a vegetable with:
 * - [name]: The vegetable name.
 * - [harvest_days]: Days from planting to harvest.
 *
 * [include] is used to loop through the list and add a [season] tag.
 * - Vegetables harvested in more than 100 days are marked as "Fall Crop".
