/*
 * This [HTTP endpoint] returns a list of books by dynamically inserting unnamed nodes from [.books] into the [return] payload.
 *
 * 1. The [.books] node is a list structure made of unnamed child nodes ([.]) representing individual book titles.
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot fetches all [.books] entries using a wildcard.
 * 3. The [add] slot merges those items into the [return] response using the path [./*/return].
 * 4. The [return] slot emits the final HTTP response as a list of strings.
