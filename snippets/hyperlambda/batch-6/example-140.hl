/*
 * This Hyperlambda file defines a basic HTTP endpoint structure.
 *
 * [.arguments]
 * - Serves as the declaration point for the endpoint, marking the file as a callable HTTP API.
 * - While no arguments are explicitly defined here, this block allows for future expansion 
 *   and establishes compatibility with HTTP-based invocation.
 *
 * [return]
 * - Concludes the execution by returning a static node named [result] with the value "success".
 * - This pattern is commonly used to signal that the operation completed successfully.
 * - The presence of [result] in the HTTP response provides a predictable outcome for clients 
 *   that rely on standardized return formats.
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to structure a lightweight endpoint that responds with 
 * a simple success message, which is ideal for testing routing, health checks, 
 * or placeholder implementations during development.
