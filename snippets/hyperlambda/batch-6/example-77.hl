/*
 * This Hyperlambda file demonstrates how to submit an order using the [http.post] slot, 
 * including query parameters to control server behavior and a payload representing the order details.
 *
 * [.discount_code]
 * - Holds a promotional discount code "SPRING25", which will be dynamically passed into the payload.
 *
 * [.client_id]
 * - Contains the value "client-001", used dynamically in the query string.
 *
 * [http.post]
 * - Sends an HTTP POST request to https://httpbin.org/post.
 * - [convert:true] enables automatic JSON-to-Hyperlambda conversion of the response.
 *
 * [query]
 * - Includes:
 *   - [priority]: A static value ("high") to simulate an urgent order.
 *   - [client]: A dynamic reference to [.client_id].
 *
 * [payload]
 * - Contains:
 *   - [item_id]: A static product ID.
 *   - [coupon]: A dynamic reference to [.discount_code].
 *   - [quantity]: A fixed integer value.
 *
 * This variation demonstrates how to inject runtime values into outgoing requests, 
 * useful for checkout flows, inventory updates, or transactional APIs.
