/*
 * This Hyperlambda file demonstrates how to convert a plain text GUID string into a properly typed [guid] node.
 *
 * [.user_id]
 * - Contains a static string value representing a globally unique identifier (GUID).
 * - Initially, this is stored as a plain string, which may limit its utility in typed validation or matching operations.
 *
 * [set-value]
 * - Replaces the string content of [.user_id] with its typed [guid] equivalent.
 *
 * [convert]
 * - Converts the value from string to [guid], enabling GUID-specific logic, comparisons, or validations.
 *
 * This pattern is commonly used in systems where IDs come from strings (e.g., config, APIs) but need strict typing.
