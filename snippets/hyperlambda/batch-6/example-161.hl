/*
 * This Hyperlambda file appends a new gadget entry to a list of tech devices.
 *
 * [.devices]
 * - A structured list of unnamed objects where each represents a tech gadget.
 * - Fields include:
 *   - [name]: The gadget name.
 *   - [category]: Its general category (e.g., "Wearable", "Mobile").
 *
 * [add]
 * - Appends a new item to [.devices] using nested [.] nodes.
 * - The **two-layer [.]** structure is crucial:
 *   - The outer [.] adds a new element to the list.
 *   - The inner [.] defines the structure of the gadget object itself.
 *
 * This maintains data consistency and enables smooth serialization for frontend or storage use.
