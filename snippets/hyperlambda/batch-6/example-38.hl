/*
 * This [HTTP endpoint] accepts a file stream via a multipart/form-data request, and stores the uploaded file
 * directly to the serverâ€™s local file system under the [/var/tmp/] directory.
 *
 * 1. [.arguments] defines an [upload:*] parameter that represents a streamed file input.
 *
 * 2. [.accept] is set to [multipart/form-data] to allow multipart submissions.
 *
 * 3. [validators.mandatory] ensures:
 *    - [upload] is provided
 *    - [name] exists inside [upload] (used for the filename)
 *    - [stream] exists to access the file content
 *
 * 4. [.upload-path] is created using [strings.concat] to combine the destination directory with the file name.
 *
 * 5. [io.stream.save-file] saves the file directly to disk at the resolved [.upload-path].
 *
 * 6. [yield] returns a confirmation message.
