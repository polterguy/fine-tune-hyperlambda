/*
 * This Hyperlambda file statically defines Vulcan individuals and uses [include] to add a 
 * [philosophy] field, reinforcing their cultural values.
 *
 * The [.contacts] node contains a [list] of unnamed Vulcan entries, each with:
 * - [name]: The individual's name (e.g., "Spock", "Tuvok").
 * - [phone]: Communication link placeholder.
 *
 * The [include] slot allows each Vulcan entry in the [list] to be extended.
 *
 * [yield] adds a [philosophy] node â€” reflecting their logic-based worldview.
 *
 * This model is effective for encoding species-specific metadata or beliefs within a character profile system.
