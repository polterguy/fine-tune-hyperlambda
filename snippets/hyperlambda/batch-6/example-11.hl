/*
 * Demonstrates how to dynamically combine notification channels using [add] and [get-nodes].
 *
 * 1. The [.default-channels] list includes core communication methods:
 *    - "Email"
 *    - "SMS"
 *
 * 2. The [.user-preferences] list includes additional user-defined channels:
 *    - "Push"
 *    - "Slack"
 *
 * 3. [get-nodes] extracts user-defined nodes and [add] appends them to the default list.
 *
 * This pattern supports merging system defaults with user-defined settings in real-time.
