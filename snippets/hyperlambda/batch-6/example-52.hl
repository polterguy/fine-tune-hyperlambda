/*
 * This Hyperlambda file defines a dynamic graph-style HTTP endpoint that returns a nested 
 * object graph of wizards and their known spells from the 'middleearth' database.
 *
 * Below is a breakdown of the slots and their function:
 *
 * [data.connect]
 * - Opens a connection to the 'middleearth' database.
 *
 * [data.read] (first)
 * - Queries the 'Wizard' table.
 * - [columns] selects the [WizardID] and [Name] fields.
 * - [where] filters wizards whose name contains "Gand".
 * - [limit] restricts the result to 5 wizard records.
 *
 * [include]
 * - Iterates over each wizard to retrieve their related spells.
 *
 * [data.read] (nested inside [include])
 * - Queries the 'Spell' table for spells associated with the wizard.
 * - [where] filters by matching [WizardID].
 *
 * [yield]
 * - Returns the spells under a [spells] node for each wizard.
