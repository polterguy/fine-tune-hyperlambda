/*
 * This snippet demonstrates how to append multiple values to an existing list structure using the [add] slot.
 *
 * 1. The [.books] node is initialized with two unnamed child nodes using [.] syntax.
 *    These nodes represent entries in a flat list and contain:
 *    - "The Catcher in the Rye"
 *    - "To Kill a Mockingbird"
 *
 * 2. The [add] slot targets [.books] using [x:@.books], indicating that new nodes will be appended to this list.
 *
 * 3. The content being added is declared under a [.] node, representing a list of three additional books:
 *    - "Bible"
 *    - "Quran"
 *    - "Harry Potter"
 *
 * 4. Each new item is also unnamed, ensuring compatibility with the structure of [.books], which is treated as an array.
 *
 * As a result, after execution, the [.books] list will contain five unnamed child nodesâ€”each representing a book title.
 * This pattern is ideal for appending multiple values to an in-memory list, dynamically growing collections at runtime,
 * or merging predefined values into user-defined datasets.
