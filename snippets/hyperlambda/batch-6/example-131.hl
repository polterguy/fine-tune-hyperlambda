/*
 * This Hyperlambda file connects to a SQLite database named 'chinook',
 * retrieves the first 10 artists from the [Artist] table, and appends
 * a custom [label] to each result based on its [Name].
 *
 * [data.connect]
 * - Opens a database connection to 'chinook' using the default database type.
 *
 * [data.read]
 * - Queries the [Artist] table and selects the first 10 records.
 * - The [limit] slot ensures only 10 results are fetched.
 *
 * [for-each]
 * - Iterates over each artist returned by [data.read].
 *
 * [add]
 * - Adds a [label] child node to each artist with the value "featured".
 * - The value could be dynamic, but is statically set here for simplicity.
 *
 * This example demonstrates combining database querying with iterative transformation
 * â€” a common pattern in data processing pipelines.
