/*
 * This Hyperlambda file demonstrates how to anonymize or redact sensitive data across a structured dataset
 * using the [set-value] slot to overwrite specific values in-place.
 *
 * [.data]
 * - A static list of unnamed child nodes ([.]), each representing a contact.
 * - Each contact node includes:
 *   - [name]: The individual's name.
 *   - [email]: Their email address, which is considered sensitive in this context.
 *
 * [set-value]
 * - Targets every [email] node within the structure using its expression containing
 *   the following iterators:
 *   - `@.data`: Refers to the root [data] node.
 *   - `*`: Selects all contact entries (list items).
 *   - `*`: Navigates to each field of the contact entry.
 *   - `email`: Filters only nodes named [email].
 *
 * - Sets the value of each matched [email] node to the literal string "REDACTED".
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ This approach is particularly useful for:
 * - Scrubbing personally identifiable information (PII) before exporting data.
 * - Applying GDPR or compliance-driven redactions.
 * - Creating anonymized datasets for training, testing, or sharing.
 *
 * The operation is declarative and applies consistently across all matching nodes â€” ensuring safe,
 * efficient, and maintainable redaction of sensitive content in hierarchical datasets.
