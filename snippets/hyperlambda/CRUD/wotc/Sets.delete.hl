 * Deletes a single record from the Sets table in the wotc database using the primary key [SetID].
 *
 * Required argument:
 * - [SetID]: The unique identifier of the set to delete. This argument is mandatory and validated before execution.
 *
 * Access to this endpoint is restricted to users with the 'root' role to ensure administrative control.
 * The deletion operation is safely parameterized to prevent SQL injection and ensure the correct record is targeted.
 *
 * Opens a secure database connection, constructs a DELETE query based on the provided SetID, and executes the operation.
 * Returns the number of affected rows as [affected], indicating whether the record was successfully removed.
