/*
 * This HTTP API endpoint deletes a single record from the "Orders" table in the Northwind database.
 * 
 * It requires the caller to provide the [OrderID] as a mandatory primary key argument. Before proceeding,
 * the endpoint ensures the user has administrative access by verifying their ticket.
 * 
 * Once authorization is confirmed, it establishes a connection to the SQLite-backed Northwind database.
 * The provided [OrderID] is used to dynamically build a filter clause for the delete operation.
 * 
 * If the delete succeeds, the endpoint emits a real-time socket signal named `northwind.Orders.delete`,
 * broadcasting the deletion event and including the original arguments along with the roles of the caller.
 * 
 * Finally, the endpoint returns the number of records affected by the delete operation to the client.
