/*
 * HTTP endpoint that deletes a single record from the "Products" table in the Northwind database.
 *
 * The caller must supply the primary key `ProductID`, which is required to uniquely identify
 * the record to delete. Authorization is enforced to ensure only users with administrative roles
 * can perform this operation.
 *
 * After opening a connection to the database, the provided `ProductID` is used to construct
 * a conditional clause for the deletion. Once the record is removed, a real-time socket
 * message is published to notify subscribers of the change, including relevant authorization metadata.
 *
 * Finally, the result is returned to the client, including how many records were affected
 * by the deletion (typically 1, or 0 if the record did not exist).
