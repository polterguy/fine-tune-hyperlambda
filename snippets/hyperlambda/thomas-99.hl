/*
 * Endpoint that registers a new IoT device in a provisioning system by storing a unique device ID and hashed API key.
 *
 * The endpoint takes [device-id] and [api-key] as input.
 * If the device already exists in the "iot_devices" table, an exception is thrown.
 * Otherwise, the API key is hashed using Blowfish and inserted along with the device ID.
