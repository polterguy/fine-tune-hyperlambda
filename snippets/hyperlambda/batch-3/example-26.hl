/*
 * Categorize a list of birds by their wing type and assign a descriptive label.
 * Each bird entry has a name and a wing type (e.g., "broad", "pointed", "rounded").
 * A [for-each] loop iterates through the list and assigns a [flight-style] label
 * depending on the wing type using [if], [else-if], and [else] control flow.
