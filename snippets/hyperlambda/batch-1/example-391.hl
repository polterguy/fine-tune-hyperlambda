/*
 * Connects to a database named "CustomerDB" using an explicit PostgreSQL connection by overriding the default database type.
 * 
 * The [data.connect] slot establishes a scoped connection to "CustomerDB". 
 * By specifying [database-type], the connection is forced to use the PostgreSQL adapter, 
 * overriding the default SQLite adapter typically used in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * Inside the [data.connect] scope, a [data.read] operation is performed to retrieve data from the "customer" table.
 * The [limit] child node ensures that only the first 5 customer records are returned.
 * 
 * NOTE: All [data.*] operations MUST be scoped within the [data.connect] node to access the database.
