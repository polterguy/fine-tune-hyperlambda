/*
 * Endpoint that returns a paged list of companies associated with a specified director,
 * excluding companies where the director's ID matches the one currently being queried.
 *
 * ### Arguments
 * - [.arguments] includes:
 *   - [director_id]: The ID of the director being queried.
 *   - [limit]: Maximum number of records to return.
 *   - [offset]: Number of records to skip (for paging).
 *
 * ### Database Connection
 * - [data.connect] connects to the [finovo] PostgreSQL database using the [finovo] connection string.
 *
 * ### Query Execution
 * - [data.select] executes a raw SQL query that:
 *   - Retrieves [org_number], [company_name], and [role_name] from joined tables [directors] and [basic].
 *   - Filters records where [d2.director_id] matches the provided [director_id],
 *     excluding records where [org_number] is the same in both [d1] and [d2].
 *   - Applies [limit] and [offset] parameters for paging.
 *
 * ### Additional Paging Notice
 * - [if] compares the number of returned rows to the [limit] value.
 * - If they match, it implies more data may exist beyond the current page.
 *   - [add] appends a [notice] to the result, alerting the caller that there may be more companies.
 *
 * ### Response
 * - [yield] returns the matching company records under the [companies] node.
 *
 * This endpoint demonstrates raw SQL querying with joins and paging,
 * dynamic filtering using arguments, and conditionally enriching the response with metadata.
