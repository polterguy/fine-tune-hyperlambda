/*
 * Defines a slot named [user.profile] that returns a structured user profile
 * containing [name], [age], and [country], and then executes the slot.
 *
 * ### Slot Creation
 * - [slots.create] registers a dynamic slot called [user.profile].
 * - [return-nodes] defines the return payload with:
 *   - [name]: Jane Doe
 *   - [age]: 35
 *   - [country]: Norway
 *
 * ### Slot Execution
 * - [execute] invokes the [user.profile] slot and returns the defined user profile structure.
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to create reusable slots in Hyperlambda
 * that return static structured data.
