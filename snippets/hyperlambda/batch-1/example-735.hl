/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to sequentially divide a floating-point number
 * using [math.divide], mixing integers and doubles in the operation.
 * 
 * 1. [math.divide]
 *    - Performs division in a left-associative manner.
 *    - Starts with the first value and divides it successively by each following value.
 * 
 * 2. [get-value]
 *    - Retrieves the initial floating-point number (20.0) from [.total].
 * 
 * 3. Literal values
 *    - The second operand is an integer (2), dividing 20.0 by 2 to get 10.0.
 *    - The third operand is a double (1.25), dividing 10.0 by 1.25 to produce the final result of 8.0.

math.divide

   // 20.0 (double)
   get-value:x:@.total

   // divide by 2 -> result 10.0
   .:int:2

   // divide by 1.25 -> result 8.0
