/*
 * Calculates the total cost per product line by multiplying [quantity] with [unitPrice],
 * and stores the result in the corresponding [lineTotal] field.
 *
 * ### Data Structure
 * - [.invoice] / [products] contains multiple product nodes.
 * - Each product has:
 *   - [quantity]: Number of units ordered.
 *   - [unitPrice]: Price per unit.
 *   - [lineTotal]: Placeholder for the computed total cost.
 *
 * ### Calculation
 * - [for-each] iterates through each product node.
 * - [math.multiply] multiplies [quantity] by [unitPrice] for the current product.
 * - [set-value] updates the [lineTotal] with the computed value for that product.
 *
 * This snippet is commonly used in invoice or shopping cart scenarios
 * where you need to calculate totals per line item.
