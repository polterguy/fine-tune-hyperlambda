/*
 * Retrieves the value of [child] from within a nested [.data] structure.
 *
 * ### Data Structure
 * - [.data] contains:
 *   - [parent], which in turn contains:
 *     - [child] with a value of 42.
 *
 * ### Retrieval
 * - [get-value] uses its expression to access the nested [child] node.
 * - This resolves to the value 42.
 *
 * This snippet demonstrates how to navigate nested node structures in Hyperlambda
 * using a precise path expression with [get-value].
