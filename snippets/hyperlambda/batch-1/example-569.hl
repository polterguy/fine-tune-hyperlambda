/*
 * Creates a MIME message with a [multipart/mixed] content type, containing multiple plain-text entities.
 *
 * ## Root Node
 * - [mime.create] declares the MIME container with a content type of 'multipart/mixed',
 *   meaning it can include multiple parts of different or same types (e.g., text, files).
 *
 * ## Configuration
 * - [structured] disables automatic structuring of the MIME message,
 *   giving you full control over how entities are added and organized.
 *
 * ## MIME Entities
 * - Two [entity] blocks are included:
 *   - Each has its own [content] node containing a plain-text message body.
 *   - These are treated as separate MIME parts within the multipart message.
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Suitable for constructing email messages or HTTP payloads that require MIME formatting with multiple bodies,
 *   such as emails with multiple text blocks, attachments, or mixed content.
