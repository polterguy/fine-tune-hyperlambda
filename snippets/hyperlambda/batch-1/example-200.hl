/*
 * Loads the [/README.md] file and counts the number of lines it contains.
 *
 * ### File Loading
 * - [io.file.load] reads the content of the [/README.md] file.
 *
 * ### Line Splitting
 * - [strings.split] splits the file content by newline characters (`"\n"`), creating one node per line.
 *
 * ### Counting
 * - [get-count] determines how many nodes were produced by the split (i.e., how many lines exist).
 * - [set-value] assigns this count to [.number-of-lines-in-file].
 *
 * This snippet is useful for processing text files and analyzing their structure,
 * such as counting lines, in Hyperlambda.
