/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates a [switch] statement that evaluates a value
 * against multiple [case] options and uses [default] when no case matches.
 *
 * 1. [.val]
 *    * Declares a value node with the value "baz".
 *
 * 2. [.result]
 *    * Placeholder node that will store the outcome of the switch evaluation.
 *
 * 3. [switch:x:@.val]
 *    * Starts the switch-case logic based on the value of [.val].
 *
 * 4. [case:foo] and [case:bar]
 *    * Defines cases to match the value of [.val] against "foo" and "bar".
 *    * If a match is found, the corresponding [set-value] is executed.
 *
 * 5. [default]
 *    * Executes if none of the [case] conditions match.
 *    * In this example, sets [.result] to "None" since [.val] = "baz" does not match any case.
 *
 * Result:
 * * [.result] will be set to "None" because "baz" does not match any defined case.
