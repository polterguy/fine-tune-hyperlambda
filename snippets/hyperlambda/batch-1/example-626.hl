/*
 * Creates a reusable custom slot named [calc.plus] that adds two numeric arguments and returns the result.
 *
 * ## Slot Definition
 * - [slots.create] registers the new slot.
 * - [get-value] retrieves the [left] and [right] arguments passed during execution.
 * - [math.add] performs addition of the two values.
 *
 * ## Result Output
 * - [yield] returns the computed total under the [total] node, using the result from [math.add].
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Ideal for modular arithmetic operations that can be reused across different endpoints or components,
 *   such as calculations in forms, dashboards, or financial logic.
