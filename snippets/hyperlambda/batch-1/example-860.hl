/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet uses [for-each] with [if] to selectively update nodes within [.car-parts].
 * It replaces the value 'available' with 'checked' for each matching part.
 *
 * 1. [.car-parts]
 *    - Contains several car components as child nodes, each with a status value.
 *
 * 2. [for-each]
 *    - Iterates over all direct children of [.car-parts], binding each node to [.dp].
 *
 * 3. [if]
 *    - Compares the value of the current node to the string 'available' using [eq].
 *
 * 4. [eq]
 *    - Returns true if the current part's value equals 'available'.
 *
 * 5. [.lambda]
 *    - Executed only if the condition is met.
 *    - [set-value] replaces the part's value with 'checked'.
 *
 * Result:
 *    - Parts marked as 'available' will be updated to 'checked', while others remain unchanged.
