/*
 * Executes two SQL SELECT queries in a single request to retrieve records from
 * the [actor] and [film] tables of the "sakila" database.
 *
 * Steps:
 * - [data.connect:sakila] opens a connection to the "sakila" database.
 * - [data.select] includes a SQL statement containing two queries:
 *   - "SELECT * FROM actor LIMIT 2;"
 *   - "SELECT * FROM film LIMIT 2;"
 *   These are executed in a single batch.
 *
 * - [multiple-result-sets:bool:true] is crucial here â€” it tells Hyperlambda to expect
 *   and handle multiple result sets in the response (one for each SELECT query).
 *
 * - [yield] returns all results from [data.select] using a wildcard path expression
 *   to extract all datasets.
 *
 * This snippet demonstrates how to retrieve and process multiple SQL result sets
 * in one invocation using Hyperlambda's [data.select] slot and multi-query support.
