/*
 * Creates a repeating task that logs a message every 50 seconds.
 *
 * ### Task Creation
 * - [tasks.create] defines a new task with the ID `task-id-qwqw`.
 * - Inside the [.lambda] block, [log.info] writes "Executing repeating task" to the log each time the task runs.
 *
 * ### Task Scheduling
 * - [tasks.schedule] activates the task using the same ID.
 * - [repeats] is set to `50.seconds`, meaning the task will execute every 50 seconds continuously.
 *
 * This snippet demonstrates how to define and schedule background tasks in Hyperlambda
 * that perform periodic operations on a timed interval.
