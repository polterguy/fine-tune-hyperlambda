 * This snippet retrieves the name of the previous sibling node of the currently executing node using the [-] iterator.
 *
 * 1. [.foo]
 *    * A node declared above the current expression to simulate a sibling node.
 *
 * 2. [x:-]
 *    * `-` is the previous sibling iterator, resolving to the node that immediately precedes the current node under the same parent.
 *    * [get-name:x:-] retrieves the name of that previous sibling node, in this case returning ".foo".
