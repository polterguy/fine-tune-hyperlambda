/*
 * Renames a node named [old-name] that resides within a [.parent] node to [new-name].
 *
 * The snippet begins with a parent node [.parent] containing a child node [old-name] with the value "foo".
 * It then uses the [set-name] slot to change the name of this child node.
 *
 * Specifically:
 * - The [set-name]'s expression value targets the existing node named [old-name] under [.parent].
 * - The [set-name] operation then renames that node to [new-name].
 *
 * This demonstrates how to rename individual nodes in a Hyperlambda structure dynamically
 * using [set-name] with an XPath-style node reference.
