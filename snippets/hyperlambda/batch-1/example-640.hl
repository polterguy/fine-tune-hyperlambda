/*
 * Defines a CRUD HTTP endpoint that deletes a single record from the [Customers] table
 * in the 'northwind' SQLite database based on the provided primary key.
 *
 * ## Input Arguments
 * - [CustomerID]: A required string that uniquely identifies the customer record to delete.
 *
 * ## Validation
 * - [validators.mandatory] ensures that the [CustomerID] argument is provided before proceeding.
 *
 * ## Database Connection & Deletion
 * - [data.connect] opens a connection to the 'northwind' database using the 'generic' connection string.
 * - [add] injects the [CustomerID] into the [where] / [and] parts of [data.delete] to ensure the correct record is targeted.
 * - [data.delete] performs the deletion from the [Customers] table.
 *
 * ## Response
 * - [yield] returns the number of affected rows via the [affected] node to indicate whether the delete was successful.
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Useful for data management tools, admin interfaces, or APIs where users can safely remove
 *   customer records from the system with proper input validation.
