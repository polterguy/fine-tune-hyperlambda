/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet uses conditional logic to check if a boolean toggle is set to true,
 * and executes different logic accordingly using [if] and [else].
 * 
 * 1. [if]
 *    - Evaluates a condition to determine if it should execute its [.lambda] block.
 *    - In this case, it checks if [.toggle] is explicitly set to true.
 * 
 * 2. [eq]
 *    - Compares two values for equality.
 *    - Returns true if the value of [.toggle] equals true.
 * 
 * 3. [.lambda]
 *    - Contains the code to execute if the [if] condition is met.
 *    - Logs a message indicating the toggle is active.
 * 
 * 4. [else]
 *    - Executes if the [if] condition evaluates to false.
 *    - Logs a message indicating the toggle is off.
