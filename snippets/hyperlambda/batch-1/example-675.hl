/*
 * This snippet defines a scheduled task in Hyperlambda that runs once every 10 years (approx. 3650 days).
 * It demonstrates how to declare and schedule long-interval, repeating background tasks.
 *
 * 1. [tasks.create]
 *    - Declares a new named task, uniquely identified by the string key ('task-id-qwerty123').
 *    - The child [.lambda] defines the logic that will execute whenever the task runs.
 *    - Inside [.lambda], [log.info] is used to indicate that the task is executing.

 * 2. [tasks.schedule]
 *    - Associates a schedule with the previously declared task.
 *    - The [repeats] node defines the repetition interval, using the syntax '3650.days'.
 *    - This ensures the task is executed once every 10 years based on an approximate daily repetition model.
