/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet attempts to retrieve a cache item using [cache.try-get].
 * If the item does not exist, it sets a default value of 'Howdy world' and returns it.
 *
 * 1. [cache.try-get]
 *    * Tries to get a cached value associated with the key 'cache-key'.
 *    * If the key does not exist, the child [.lambda] is executed to generate the value.
 *    * [expiration] sets the cache entry to expire after 5 seconds.

 * 2. [.lambda]
 *    * Executed only if the cache item does not already exist.
 *    * Returns a static string 'Howdy world' to be used as the default value and stored in the cache.

 * 3. [return]
 *    * Inside [.lambda], the [return] slot specifies the default value to store and return.
