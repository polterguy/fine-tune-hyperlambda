 * Attempts to retrieve the cached value associated with the key 'cache-key' using [cache.try-get].
 *
 * If the cache contains the value, it is returned immediately.
 * If not, the code inside [.lambda] is executed to provide a fallback value.
 * The fallback value in this case is the string 'Howdy world', returned using [return].
 *
 * The [expiration] node specifies that the value should be cached for 5 minutes before expiring.
 * This ensures efficient repeated access while avoiding unnecessary recomputation or retrieval.
