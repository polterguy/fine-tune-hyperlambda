/*
 * Adds the children of [.src1] and [.src2] to both [.dest] nodes.
 *
 * ### Data Structure
 * - Two [.dest] nodes exist at the same level in the structure.
 * - [.src1] contains child node [foo1] with value 'bar1'.
 * - [.src2] contains child node [foo2] with value 'bar2'.
 *
 * ### Operation
 * - [add] targets all [.dest] nodes.
 * - [get-nodes] retrieves the child nodes of [.src1] and [.src2].
 * - These nodes are then added to both [.dest] nodes.
 *
 * This pattern is useful for duplicating content into multiple targets,
 * such as syncing configurations or propagating common values in Hyperlambda.
