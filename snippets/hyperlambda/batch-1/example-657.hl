/*
 * This snippet demonstrates how to dynamically define and invoke a custom slot in Hyperlambda.
 * The [slots.create] slot is used to define a new slot named 'foo'.
 * Inside the custom slot, the [return-value] slot sets a return value of type 'int' with a value of 57.
 * After the slot has been created, [signal] is used to invoke it.
 * The [signal] slot triggers execution of a slot by name, and returns the value or nodes defined by that slot.
 * This pattern is useful for creating reusable and dynamic logic structures within your Hyperlambda code.

slots.create:foo
   return-value:int:57

// Then we invoke it.
signal:foo
