/*
 * This snippet defines a custom slot that returns a static string value.
 *
 * 1. [slots.create]
 *    - Declares a new dynamic slot in the system with the specified name ('giveAnswer').
 *    - Slots created using [slots.create] can be invoked dynamically later using [signal] or [execute].
 *    - The logic defined inside this node becomes the body of the slot.
 *
 * 2. [return-value]
 *    - Specifies the static value that will be returned when the slot is invoked.
 *    - It represents a simple return construct, typically used for scalar values such as strings, numbers, etc.
 *    - Unlike [return-nodes], which returns full node trees, [return-value] is used when returning a single value.
