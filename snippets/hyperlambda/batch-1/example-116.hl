/*
 * This snippet retrieves the name of a deeply nested node using a composed iterator path.
 *
 * 1. [.data]
 *    * Root node named [.data] that contains a child node [parent].
 *
 * 2. [parent]
 *    * Child of [.data], which itself contains a child node named [child] with value '42'.
 *
 * 3. [get-name]
 *    * Uses a composed expression to navigate two levels deep into [.data].
 *    * The first `*` retrieves all children of [.data] (e.g. [parent]).
 *    * The second `*` retrieves all children of [parent] (e.g. [child]).
 *    * `get-name` extracts the name of the matched node, which is 'child'.
