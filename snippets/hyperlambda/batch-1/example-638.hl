 * Defines a secure HTTP endpoint that creates a new record in the 'cloudlets' table
 * of the 'hub' database. Only users with the 'root' role are authorized to use this endpoint.
 *
 * ## Input Arguments

 * - [name]: Name of the cloudlet.
 * - [plan]: Plan type assigned to the cloudlet (e.g., 'free', 'pro').
 * - [cluster]: Cluster where the cloudlet is deployed.
 * - [user]: Username or ID associated with the owner of the cloudlet.
 *
 * ## Authorization
 * - [auth.ticket.verify] ensures that only users with the 'root' role can access the endpoint.
 *
 * ## Database Interaction
 * - [data.connect] connects to the 'hub' database using the 'generic' connection string.
 * - [add] injects all provided arguments into the [values] node of [data.create].
 * - [data.create] inserts the new cloudlet into the [cloudlets] table.
 *
 * ## Response
 * - [response.status.set] sets the HTTP response status code to 201 (Created).
 * - [yield] returns the ID of the newly created cloudlet using the [id] node.
 *
 * ## Use Case

 *   are created and associated with user accounts in a centralized system.
