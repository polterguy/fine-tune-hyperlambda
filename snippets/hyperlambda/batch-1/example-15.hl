/*
 * Creates a new invoice via an HTTP POST request to a billing API
 * and conditionally updates the [.invoice.status] based on the HTTP response code.
 *
 * Steps:
 * - Initializes [.invoice.status] to "unknown".
 * - [http.post] sends a POST request to "https://billing.example.com/api/v1/invoices"
 *   with a JSON payload containing:
 *   - [customer_id]: 101 (int)
 *   - [amount]: 299.99 (decimal)
 *   - [currency]: NOK
 * - [convert:true] ensures the response is automatically parsed into a lambda structure.
 *
 * - An [if] block checks whether the HTTP status code is in the 2xx success range:
 *   - [mte] (more than or equal) checks the code is >= 200
 *   - [lt] (less than) ensures it is < 300
 * - If both conditions are true, the [.lambda] block updates [.invoice.status]
 *   to "Invoice created successfully".
 *
 * This example shows how to issue a POST request, validate success using HTTP status codes,
 * and act conditionally based on the result.
