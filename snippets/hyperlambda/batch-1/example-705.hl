/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates conditional logic using [if] and [and] to evaluate multiple criteria.
 * It grants permission only if both conditions are met.

 * 1. [if]
 *    - Evaluates a conditional expression and executes its [.lambda] child only if the condition is true.
 *    - Enables branching logic based on runtime values.

 * 2. [and]
 *    - Logical operator that returns true only if all its child conditions are true.
 *    - Used here to combine multiple [eq] conditions into a single composite rule.

 * 3. [eq]
 *    - Compares two values for equality.
 *    - Used to verify that the user's role is 'editor' and the content type is 'premium'.

 * 4. [set-value]
 *    - Executes within the [.lambda] block if the condition passes.
 *    - Sets the value of [.permission] to 'granted' to reflect access approval.
