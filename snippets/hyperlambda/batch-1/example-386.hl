/*
 * Demonstrates how to divide two static integers using [math.divide].
 *
 * - The slot [math.divide] performs sequential division from top to bottom.
 * - The first value, 100, is divided by 4, resulting in 25.
 *
 * This snippet uses inline type declarations ([int]) to explicitly mark numeric literals.
 * Only two operands are used, but [math.divide] can also handle more than two operands for chained division.
