/*
 * Retrieves a translation string from the [.translations] node based on a dynamic language code.
 *
 * For example, if [.language] contains `"fr"`, it will return the [greeting] node being a child of
 * a [fr] node, which again is a child of the [.translations] node.
 *
 * Perfect for dynamic internationalization and localization.
