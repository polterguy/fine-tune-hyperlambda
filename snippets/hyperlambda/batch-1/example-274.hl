/*
 * Creates a slot named [build.error] that returns a structured error object,
 * and then executes the slot to retrieve the result.
 *
 * ### Slot Definition
 * - [slots.create] registers a dynamic slot named [build.error].
 * - [return-nodes] defines the return structure:
 *   - [error] contains:
 *     - [code]: 404
 *     - [message]: Not found
 *
 * ### Slot Execution
 * - [execute] calls the [build.error] slot and returns its result.
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to define and invoke reusable slots in Hyperlambda
 * to standardize structured responses such as error messages.
