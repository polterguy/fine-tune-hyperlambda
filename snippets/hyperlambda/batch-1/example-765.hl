/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet conditionally executes a [.lambda] block based on a boolean value.
 *
 * 1. [if]
 *    - Evaluates the condition provided in its child node.
 *    - If the condition is true, the inner [.lambda] block is executed.
 *
 * 2. [.lambda]
 *    - Encapsulates the code that should run when the [if] condition is satisfied.
 *
 * 3. [set-value]
 *    - Sets the value of the [.result] node to 'OK' as the outcome of the conditional logic.
