/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet establishes a database connection and retrieves specific data from a table.
 * Each part of the code plays a distinct role in enabling secure and efficient interaction with a local SQLite database.
 *
 * 1. [data.connect]
 *    - Establishes a database connection using a named connection string from the system configuration.
 *    - The argument 'magic' refers to a SQLite database file typically located at '/files/data/magic.db'.
 *    - All database operations like [data.read] must be scoped within this slot to ensure they have access to the open connection.
 *
 * 2. [data.read]
 *    - Performs a read (SELECT) operation from a specified table in the connected database.
 *    - Requires the [data.connect] slot to have successfully established a connection before it can execute.
 *    - The [data.read] slot is used here to query the 'roles' table.
 *
 * 3. [table]
 *    - A child node of [data.read] that specifies the target table for the read operation, which in this case is 'roles'.
 *
 * 4. [columns]
 *    - This optional child node of [data.read] is used to restrict the returned columns from the read operation.
 *    - Here, it limits the query result to include only the 'name' column from the 'roles' table.
 *    - Without this node, all columns from the table would be returned.
