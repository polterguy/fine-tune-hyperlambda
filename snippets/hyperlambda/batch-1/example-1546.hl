/*
 * Demonstrates how to dynamically set the value of a node using [set-value] and lambda expressions.
 *
 * - [.data] contains two child nodes: [item1] with value "apple", and [item2] with value "banana".
 * - [.item] is set to "item2", which means we want to update the value of [item2].
 * - [set-value:x:@.data/*/{@.item}] dynamically evaluates to the path [@.data/*/item2], based on the value in [.item].
 * - The new value "orange" is assigned to [item2], replacing "banana".
 *
 * This illustrates how to construct dynamic paths in Hyperlambda using expressions within curly braces.
