/*
 * This snippet demonstrates the use of [fork] to simulate a long-running task
 * executed in parallel, without blocking the main execution thread.
 *
 * 1. [fork]
 *    - Spawns a new thread of execution for its child nodes.
 *    - The code inside this block runs asynchronously from the main flow.
 *
 * 2. [sleep]
 *    - Delays execution inside the [fork] by 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds), simulating a long-running operation.
 *
 * 3. [log.info]
 *    - Logs the message "Long-running task completed" once the simulated delay finishes.
 *    - This log is written from the background thread.
 *
 * 4. [log.info] (outside the [fork])
 *    - Logs "Main process continues..." immediately after spawning the [fork].
 *    - Demonstrates that the main execution thread is not blocked by the parallel task.
