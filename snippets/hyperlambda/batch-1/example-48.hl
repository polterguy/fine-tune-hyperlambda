/*
 * This snippet demonstrates the use of dot-prefixed nodes (e.g. [.src] and [.dest]) to store and manipulate data.
 * Dot-prefixed nodes are treated as data containers and are ignored by the Hyperlambda evaluator unless explicitly referenced.
 *
 * 1. [.src]
 *    * Stores the string value `'foo'`.
 *    * The dot prefix ensures the node is not interpreted as a slot or executable element.

 * 2. [.dest]
 *    * Declares a data segment node to later hold the value retrieved from [.src].

 * 3. [set-value]
 *    * Sets the value of [.dest] using the value from [.src].

 * 4. [get-value:x:@.src]
 *    * Retrieves the value of [.src] by using the named iterator `@` to reference the node named [.src].
