/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to execute a block of logic
 * if at least one condition evaluates to true using the [or] slot.
 *
 * 1. [.result]
 *    * Declares a placeholder node that will store the result of the evaluation.
 *
 * 2. [if]
 *    * Begins a conditional block.
 *
 * 3. [or]
 *    * Evaluates multiple boolean values:
 *    * - The first condition is false.
 *    * - The second condition is true.
 *    * Since [or] requires only one condition to be true, this block will pass.
 *
 * 4. [.lambda]
 *    * Executes because the [or] block evaluated to true.
 *
 * 5. [set-value]
 *    * Sets the value of [.result] to "OK", indicating the condition was met.
 *
 * Result:
 * * [.result] will contain the string "OK" after execution because at least one condition was true.
