/*
 * This snippet declares a node named [.reference-node] that contains a node reference using the `node:` type prefix.
 *
 * 1. [.reference-node]
 *    * Declares a node that will store a reference to a dynamically created node tree as its value.
 *
 * 2. [`node:`]
 *    * The `node:` prefix indicates the value is not a regular string but a **node structure**, encoded as a string.
 *    * When parsed, the string is transformed into an **actual tree of child nodes**.
 *
 * 3. Value string:
 *    * The string that follows (`.data\n   name:Thomas\n   email:thomas@ainiro.io`) represents a Hyperlambda-formatted node tree.
 *    * It will be dynamically evaluated into a structure like:
 *      ```hyperlambda
 *      .data
 *         name:Thomas
 *         email:thomas@ainiro.io
 *      ```
 *
 * Use Cases:
 * * Dynamically creating reusable node templates.
 * * Storing lambda trees in variables for later [unwrap], [include], or [eval].
 *
 * The [for-each] loop and the [include] slots always passes in the currently iterated item as a [.dp] node
 * containing a reference to the currently iterated node.
