/*
 * Defines a secure HTTP endpoint that deletes a single record from the 'CustomerDemographics' table
 * in the 'northwind' SQLite database. The record to delete is specified by its primary key [CustomerTypeID].
 *
 * ## Input Arguments
 * - [CustomerTypeID]: Required string argument that uniquely identifies the record to be deleted.
 *
 * ## Validation
 * - [validators.mandatory] ensures the [CustomerTypeID] argument is provided before proceeding.
 *
 * ## Database Connection & Deletion
 * - [data.connect] establishes a connection to the 'northwind' database using the 'generic' connection string.
 * - [add] dynamically injects the [CustomerTypeID] filter into the [where] / [and] clause of [data.delete].
 * - [data.delete] performs the deletion based on the specified [CustomerTypeID] in the 'CustomerDemographics' table.
 *
 * ## Output
 * - [unwrap] ensures that [return]'s children nodes have their expressions evaluated returning tha value and NOT the expression.
 * - [return] includes the number of affected rows via the [affected] key, indicating whether the delete operation was successful.
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Ideal for administrative tools or APIs that allow safe deletion of customer demographic data based on explicit user input.
