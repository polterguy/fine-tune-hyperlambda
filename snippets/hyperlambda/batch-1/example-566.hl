/*
 * Demonstrates how to use [not-exists] to check if a node or its children are missing.
 *
 * ## Initialization
 * - [.src1] contains a single child node [foo].
 * - [.src2] is declared but contains no children.
 *
 * ## Existence Checks
 * - The first [not-exists] checks if [.src1] has **no** children — this will return `false` because [foo] exists.
 * - The second [not-exists] checks if [.src2] has no children — this will return `true` because it's empty.
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Useful for conditional logic where you want to proceed only if a node or set of nodes is absent.
