/*
 * Selects a dashboard path dynamically based on the user's role.
 *
 * ### Logic
 * - [.dashboard] is the node where the selected dashboard path will be stored.
 * - [auth.ticket.in-role] checks if the current user belongs to the 'sales' role.
 *   - If true:
 *     - [.lambda] sets [.dashboard] to "/dashboards/sales.hl".
 *   - [else] sets it to a default dashboard path "/dashboards/default.hl".
 *
 * This snippet is useful in multi-role applications where different dashboards
 * or UI views should be presented based on user privileges.
