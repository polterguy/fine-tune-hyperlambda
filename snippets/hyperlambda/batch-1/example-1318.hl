/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet iterates through a list of car parts
 * and appends the text " is checked" to each item's value.
 *
 * 1. [.car-parts]
 *    * Contains a list of car part names such as [engine], [wheel], and [door].
 *    * Each node is a key with no initial value.
 *
 * 2. [for-each:x:@.car-parts/*]
 *    * Iterates over each child node under [.car-parts].
 *
 * 3. [set-value:x:@.dp/#]
 *    * Sets the value of the current item being iterated.
 *    * The lambda expression [@.dp/#] references the exact node to modify.
 *
 * 4. [strings.concat]
 *    * Concatenates the name of the current node (e.g., "engine") with the string " is checked".
 *    * [get-name:x:@.dp/#] dynamically retrieves the name of the node.
 *
 * Result:
 * * After execution, each car part node will have a value like:
 *   - engine: "engine is checked"
 *   - wheel: "wheel is checked"
 *   - door: "door is checked"
