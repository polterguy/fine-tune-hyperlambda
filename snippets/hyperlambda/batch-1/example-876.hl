/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet connects to a SQL Server database named 'hr_db' and retrieves active employee details.
 * The results are added to a [.result] node for further processing or returning to the client.
 *
 * 1. [.result]
 *    - Serves as the container node for storing the final results of the database operation.
 *
 * 2. [data.connect]
 *    - Establishes a connection to the 'hr_db' database.
 *    - The child node [database-type] specifies that the database engine is Microsoft SQL Server ('mssql').
 *    - All operations needing this connection must be defined as children of [data.connect].
 *
 * 3. [data.select]
 *    - Executes the raw SQL query to retrieve [employee_id], [name], [department], and [hire_date] from the 'employees' table.
 *    - The query includes a filter to only return employees where status equals 'active'.
 *    - Database type (dialect) is explicitly set to Microsoft SQL Server.
 *
 * 4. [add]
 *    - Injects the result of the [data.select] query into the [.result] node.
 *    - The lambda expression `@data.select/*` is used to retrieve all child nodes (rows) produced by [data.select].
