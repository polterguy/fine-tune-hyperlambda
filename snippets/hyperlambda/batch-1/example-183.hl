/*
 * Executes conditional logic by checking the value of the [foo] argument,
 * and logs a message if it evaluates to true.
 *
 * ### Conditional Logic
 * - [if] uses [eq] to compare the value of [.arguments/foo] to `true`.
 * - If the condition is met:
 *   - [.lambda] block is executed.
 *   - [log.info] logs the message "Condition is true".
 *
 * This pattern is commonly used in Hyperlambda to trigger logic based on
 * input values passed to an endpoint or workflow.
