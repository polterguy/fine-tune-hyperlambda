/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet performs sequential subtraction using [math.subtract],
 * subtracting multiple values from a base number.
 * 
 * 1. [math.subtract]
 *    - Performs left-to-right subtraction starting from the base value (20).
 *    - Each subsequent value is subtracted from the running result.
 * 
 * 2. Literal integer values
 *    - The first operand (5) is subtracted from 20, yielding 15.
 *    - The second operand (3) is subtracted from 15, resulting in the final value of 12.
