/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to add child nodes from multiple source nodes
 * into multiple destination nodes using the [add] slot.
 *
 * 1. [.dest1] and [.dest2]
 *    * Empty destination nodes that will receive children from the sources.
 *
 * 2. [.src1] and [.src2]
 *    * Source nodes containing child nodes:
 *    * - [.src1] has [foo1:bar1]
 *    * - [.src2] has [foo2:bar2]
 *
 * 3. [add]
 *    * Targets all destination nodes matching the pattern [.dest*] using the expression `../*/.dest*`.
 *    * Uses two [get-nodes] calls to retrieve child nodes from both [.src1] and [.src2].
 *    * All child nodes are copied into each matching destination node.
 *
 * Result:
 * * Both [.dest1] and [.dest2] will contain:
 *   - [foo1:bar1]
 *   - [foo2:bar2]
