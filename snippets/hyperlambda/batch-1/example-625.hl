/*
 * Declares a list of team members and their assigned roles using a structured node hierarchy.
 *
 * ## Structure
 * - [.team] / [members] contains an array of objects, each defined using [.] to represent an individual object.
 * - Each user object has:
 *   - [username]: The user's login name.
 *   - [role]: The role assigned to the user (e.g., 'admin', 'editor').
 *
 * ## Contents
 * - 'alice' is assigned the 'admin' role.
 * - 'bob' is assigned the 'editor' role.
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - This structure is ideal for managing user-role mappings in applications such as role-based access control (RBAC),
 *   audit tracking, permission management, or configuration of team-based features.
