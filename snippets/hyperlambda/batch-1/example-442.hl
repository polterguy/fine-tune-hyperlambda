/*
 * Creates a reusable task named 'foo-bar-task-3' and schedules it for execution at a specific date and time.
 *
 * ## Task Creation
 * - [tasks.create] registers a new named task called 'foo-bar-task-3'.
 * - The task contains a [.lambda] node which logs the message 'Executing foo-bar-task-3' via [log.info] when executed.
 *
 * ## Scheduling the Task
 * - [tasks.schedule] schedules the previously created 'foo-bar-task-3' for execution.
 * - The [due] property is set to the exact datetime '2025-12-24T17:00:00', which determines when the task will be invoked.
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Useful for deferring task execution until a later time, for things like notifications, reports, or timed workflows.
