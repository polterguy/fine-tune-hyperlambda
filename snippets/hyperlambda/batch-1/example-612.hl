/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates using `null` in an `if` condition.
 *
 * 1. The [.data' node has a child [foo] with no value.
 * 2. The [if] slot checks if [foo] is null.
 * 3. If [foo] is null, [.result] is set to "foo is null".
 * 4. In the else we set [.result] to "foo is NOT null"
 *
 * Since [foo] is null [.result] will have the value of "foo is null".
