/*
 * Conditional [if] logic that sets a result based on the value of a boolean flag.
 * 
 * The [.args] section declares a [flag] node of type `bool`, initially set to true.
 * A [.result] placeholder node is initialized without a value.
 * 
 * The [if] slot evaluates its expression leading to [flag], which resolves to true since its value is `true`.
 * If the condition is met, the nested [.lambda] is executed, assigning the value "Yes" to [.result].
 * 
 * This structure enables dynamic execution based on runtime conditions using lambda expressions.
