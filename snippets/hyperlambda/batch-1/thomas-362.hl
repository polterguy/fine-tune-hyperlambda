/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet sends **multiple individual emails** using a single invocation of [mail.smtp.send].
 * Each [message] node represents a separate email message, allowing batch sending through one SMTP session.
 *
 * 1. [mail.smtp.send]
 *    * The parent slot responsible for handling SMTP email transmission.
 *    * Can contain one or more [message] nodes, each resulting in a separate outbound email.
 *
 * 2. [message]
 *    * Defines the structure of each individual email to be sent.
 *    * Multiple [message] nodes can be provided under a single [mail.smtp.send].
 *    * Each email includes:
 *
 *    a) [to]
 *       - Specifies the recipient.
 *       - Uses a child node with [email] as the key.
 *       - In this case:
 *         - First message: user1@example.com
 *         - Second message: user2@example.com
 *
 *    b) [subject]
 *       - Subject line of the email.
 *       - First message: "First Message"
 *       - Second message: "Second Message"
 *
 *    c) [entity:text/plain]
 *       - MIME type for the email body (plain text in this case).
 *       - [content] contains the actual message body.
 *
 * 3. Execution Behavior:
 *    * Each [message] block results in an individual email.
 *    * Uses the same SMTP connection/session to send all messages, which improves efficiency.
 *
 * Result:
 * Sends two emails:
 * - One to user1@example.com with the subject "First Message"
 * - One to user2@example.com with the subject "Second Message"
 *
 * This is useful for notifying multiple users without needing to call [mail.smtp.send] separately for each.
