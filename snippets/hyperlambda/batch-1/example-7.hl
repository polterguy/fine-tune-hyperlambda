/*
 * Adds a new product entry into the "products" table of the "inventory_db" PostgreSQL database.
 *
 * The operation is performed in two steps:
 * 
 * 1. [data.connect:inventory_db] establishes a connection to the "inventory_db" database, 
 *    explicitly specifying the database type as PostgreSQL using [database-type:pgsql].
 *
 * 2. A [data.create] slot is used to insert a new record into the "products" table.
 *    The inserted fields include:
 *    - [product_id] with an integer value of 2005
 *    - [name] with the value "Laptop"
 *    - [price] with a decimal value of 999.99
 *    - [stock] with an integer quantity of 50
 *
 * This snippet demonstrates how to perform an INSERT operation in Hyperlambda
 * using the [data.create] slot and how to explicitly specify the database and types
 * of each field for data integrity.
