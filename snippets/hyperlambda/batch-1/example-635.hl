/*
 * Demonstrates use of the [if] statement with an [or] condition to determine whether a notification should be triggered.
 *
 * ## Initialization
 * - [.payment] is set to 'pending'.
 * - [.shipment] is set to 'ready'.
 * - [.notification] is where the result will be stored if the condition is true.
 *
 * ## Conditional Logic
 * - [if] checks whether either of the following is true using [or]:
 *   - [.payment] is equal to 'pending'
 *   - [.shipment] is equal to 'delayed'
 * - If at least one condition is true, the [.lambda] block executes.
 *
 * ## Result
 * - [set-value] sets [.notification] to 'Action needed' if the condition passes.
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Ideal for triggering alerts or user-facing messages based on combined system or order status checks.
