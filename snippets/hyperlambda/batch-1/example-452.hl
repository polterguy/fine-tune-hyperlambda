/*
 * Sends email notifications to customers whose subscriptions have expired, using the 'billing' PostgreSQL database.
 *
 * ## Database Query
 * - [data.connect] establishes a connection to the 'billing' database using the 'pgsql' connection string.
 * - [data.select] executes a raw SQL query on the 'subscriptions' table to retrieve customer [name] and [email]
 *   where the 'status' is 'expired'.
 *
 * ## Email Loop
 * - [for-each] iterates over each returned customer record.
 * - [unwrap] simplifies referencing fields from the currently iterated node.
 * - [mail.smtp.send] sends a plain text email to each customer:
 *   - [to] is dynamically populated from the database record using [name] and [email].
 *   - [from] is explicitly set to a custom sender with name 'Billing Team' and email 'billing@yourcompany.com'.
 *   - [subject] is set to 'Your Subscription Has Expired'.
 *   - [entity] contains a static plain-text message prompting the customer to renew their subscription.
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Useful for billing teams to automate renewal reminders for lapsed customers, reducing churn and maintaining engagement.
