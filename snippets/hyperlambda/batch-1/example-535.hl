/*
 * Checks the existence of two specific files on the server:
 * - '/config/settings.json'
 * - '/logs/system.log'
 *
 * ## Logic
 * - [if] condition combines both checks using [and]:
 *   - [io.file.exists] returns true if the file exists.
 *   - Both file checks must return true for the inner [.lambda] block to execute.
 *
 * ## Outcome
 * - If both files exist, [.result] is set to "Both files are available for processing."
 * - If either or both are missing, [.result] is set to "One or both files are missing!"
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Useful for pre-flight checks, system readiness validation, or conditional logic based on available resources.
