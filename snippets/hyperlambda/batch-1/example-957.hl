/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet creates a scheduled task using [tasks.create],
 * which logs a message to the server log.
 *
 * 1. [tasks.create]
 *    * Creates a task with the ID [task-id].
 *    * The task logic is defined in the [.lambda] block.
 *
 * 2. [.lambda]
 *    * Contains the code that will execute when the task is triggered.
 *    * In this case, it logs the message:
 *      "It is the 5th or the 15th of January or February, and the time is 5AM at night."
 *
 * Note:
 * * This snippet defines the task, but to execute it on a schedule,
 *   a corresponding [tasks.schedule] must be created separately.
