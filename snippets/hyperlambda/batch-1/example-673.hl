/*
 * This snippet demonstrates how to copy nodes from one source node to a destination node using [add] and [get-nodes].
 *
 * 1. [add]
 *    - Adds one or more nodes into a specified parent node.
 *    - The target parent is specified via the expression in the 'x:' attribute (in this case, '../*/.dest').
 *    - It will append new nodes as children to [.dest].

 * 2. [get-nodes]
 *    - Retrieves a node set for evaluation or injection.
 *    - Here it selects all child nodes under [.src] using its expression.
 *    - The retrieved nodes are then passed into [add] and appended into the [.dest] node.
