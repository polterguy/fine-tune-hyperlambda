/*
 * Iterates through each item in the [.items] collection using [for-each],
 * where each child node contains an integer value.
 *
 * Inside the loop:
 * - [math.add] is used to add the current [.sum] value with the value of the current item.
 * - The result of this addition is then stored back into [.sum] using [set-value].
 *
 * This pattern demonstrates how to aggregate values in a list by summing them,
 * using slot-based iteration and arithmetic.
