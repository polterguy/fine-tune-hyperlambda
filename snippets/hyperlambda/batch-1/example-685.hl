/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet creates a new employee record in the 'employees' table of the 'hr_db' SQLite database.
 * It ensures a proper connection is established and the values are inserted with correct types and formatting.
 *
 * 1. [data.connect]
 *    - Establishes a connection to the 'hr_db' SQLite database.
 *    - Must be used before any CRUD operation such as [data.create].
 *    - All database operations that follow are scoped within this node.

 * 2. [data.create]
 *    - Executes a SQL INSERT operation into the specified table.
 *    - In this case, inserts a new row into the 'employees' table.
 *    - Contains two main children:
 *       - [table]: Specifies the table being targeted ('employees').
 *       - [values]: Holds the column data being inserted.

 * 3. [values]
 *    - Encapsulates the key-value pairs representing column names and their corresponding values.
 *    - This example demonstrates use of strongly typed values like:
 *       - 'int' for 'employee_id'
 *       - 'decimal' for 'salary'
 *       - 'date' for 'hire_date'
 *    - Ensures the correct types are inserted into the database columns.
