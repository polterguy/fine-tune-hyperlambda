 * Increments the value of the [.arg] node by 1 using the [math.increment] slot.
 * 
 * The [.arg] node is initially defined with a value of 5 and a type of [int].
 * The [math.increment] slot updates the value in-place with a default step of 1,
 * unless an optional second child node is supplied to override the step amount.
 * 
 * After execution, [.arg] will hold the value 6.
