/*
 * Serves different support contact information based on the user's role using [auth.ticket.in-role].
 * 
 * - The [.support] node is used to store the final message shown to the user.
 * - [if] conditionally checks if the authenticated user belongs to the "premium" role.
 * - If true, the [.lambda] block is executed, and a premium support email address is set.
 * - If false (the user is not in the "premium" role), the [else] block provides a fallback help center message.
 * 
 * The [auth.ticket.in-role] slot safely checks the user's role membership without throwing exceptions,
 * making it ideal for conditional rendering of role-specific content like support options.
