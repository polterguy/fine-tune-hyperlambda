/*
 * Demonstrates the use of the [and] slot within an [if] conditional to evaluate multiple boolean conditions sequentially.
 * 
 * ## Evaluation Logic
 * - The [and] slot evaluates two boolean values: `true` and `false`.
 * - Since [and] returns `true` only if **all** child conditions are `true`, this will evaluate to `false`.
 * 
 * ## Control Flow
 * - The [.lambda] branch inside the [if] block is skipped because the combined condition is not met.
 * - As a result, [set-value] is never executed and the [.result] node remains unaffected.
 * 
 * This pattern is useful for validating that multiple criteria are simultaneously satisfied before performing an action.
