/*
 * Connects to the [hospital] database and deletes all records from the [patients] table
 * where the [diagnosis] field is equal to 'Cold'.
 *
 * ### Database Connection
 * - [sqlite.connect] establishes a connection to the 'hospital' SQLite database.
 *
 * ### Deletion Logic
 * - [sqlite.delete] targets the 'patients' table for deletion.
 * - [where] clause applies a condition:
 *   - Only rows where [diagnosis] is equal to 'Cold' will be deleted.
 *
 * This snippet demonstrates how to safely perform conditional deletions
 * in a SQLite database using Hyperlambda.
