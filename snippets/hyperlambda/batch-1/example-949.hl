/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet evaluates whether a given number of trials exceeds a threshold,
 * and sets a verdict accordingly.
 *
 * 1. [.verdict]
 *    * Placeholder node where the final decision will be stored if the condition is met.
 *
 * 2. [.number-of-trials]
 *    * Declares an integer node with a value of 42.
 *    * This represents the number of attempts or efforts being evaluated.
 *
 * 3. [if]
 *    * Begins a conditional block to assess whether the trials exceed a threshold.
 *
 * 4. [gt]
 *    * Compares if [.number-of-trials] is greater than 40.
 *    * Uses [get-value] to retrieve the dynamic value of [.number-of-trials].
 *    * Returns true because 42 > 40.
 *
 * 5. [.lambda]
 *    * Executes only if the [gt] condition is true.
 *    * Inside, [set-value] assigns the string "You are worthy!" to [.verdict].
