/*
 * This code demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to modify the values of nodes in a Hyperlambda tree.
 *
 * - [.data] contains two child nodes: [item1] and [item2], both initially with null values.
 * - [set-value:x:@.data/*] updates the value of each child node of [.data] to "Updated Value".
 * - [@.data/*] is a lambda expression selecting all direct children of [.data].
 * - The [.:"Updated Value"] is the new value assigned to each node.
 *
 * After execution, both [item1] and [item2] will hold the value "Updated Value".
