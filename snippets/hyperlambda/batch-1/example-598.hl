/*
 * Uses the '[x|y]' iterator syntax to filter and process only specific child nodes by name.
 *
 * ## Initialization
 * - [.set] contains multiple fruit nodes, each with a color value.
 *   - Includes [apple], [banana], [cherry], and [date].
 *
 * ## Filtering Logic
 * - [for-each] iterates only over nodes named [apple] or [cherry].
 *   - This syntax ensures only the targeted nodes are affected.
 *
 * ## Operation
 * - [set-value] updates the value of each matching node to 'picked'.
 * - `@.dp/#` resolves the current nodeâ€™s reference and assigns the new value.
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Ideal for selectively updating, transforming, or processing a subset of nodes by name
 *   in collections or structured data sets.
