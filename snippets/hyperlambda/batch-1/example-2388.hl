/*
 * This Hyperlambda HTTP endpoint checks if an employee is at least 18 years old based on their username.
 * It retrieves the user's birth date from the [employees] table in the [HR] database and compares it to the current date.
 *
 * 1. [.arguments]
 *    * Accepts one required argument:
 *      - [username]: The employee's username to look up.
 *
 * 2. [data.connect:HR]
 *    * Establishes a connection to the [HR] database where employee records are stored.
 *
 * 3. [data.read]
 *    * Queries the [employees] table to retrieve the [birth_day] (birth date) for the specified username.
 *    * Uses a [where] clause with [username.eq] to filter the result to one employee.
 *
 * 4. [if mt]
 *    * Compares the employee’s age to 18 using time-based arithmetic.
 *    * The [mt] (more than) slot checks if:
 *      - The difference between the current date ([date.now]) and the employee's [birth_date]
 *      - Is greater than or equal to the milliseconds equivalent of 18 years.
 *    * [math.subtract] computes the age duration in milliseconds.
 *    * [math.multiply] computes the threshold for 18 years as [365 days × 18].
 *
 * 5. [return result:bool:true]
 *    * If the user is 18 or older, returns [result:true].
 *
 * 6. [return result:bool:false]
 *    * If the user is under 18 or no match is found, returns [result:false].
 *
 * Result:
 * Provides a boolean result indicating whether the user is legally an adult (18+).
 * Useful for access control, validations, or eligibility checks based on age.
