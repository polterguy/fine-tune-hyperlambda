/*
 * Generates a simple vertical bar chart and saves it as an image file.
 *
 * ## Chart Configuration
 * - [image.chart]:bars is used to create a standard bar chart.
 * - [filename] specifies the output path for the image as '/bar-chart.png'.
 * - [width] and [height] define the dimensions of the chart (600x300 pixels).
 *
 * ## Bar Data
 * - [bars] contains individual categories:
 *   - [Spring]: Height of 2
 *   - [Summer]: Height of 5
 *   - [Autumn]: Height of 10
 * - Each value is typed as [int] to indicate numerical values for the bar heights.
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Ideal for visualizing seasonal data, statistics, or categorical comparisons.
 * - This snippet could easily be expanded with [legend] and [ticks] for more detailed charts.
