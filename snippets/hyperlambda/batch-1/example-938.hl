/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates a [while] loop that continues executing
 * as long as the boolean condition [.continue] is true.
 *
 * 1. [while]
 *    * Starts a loop that repeatedly evaluates its [.lambda] block while the condition is true.
 *
 * 2. [eq]
 *    * Compares the value of [.continue] to the boolean literal true.
 *    * Uses [get-value] implicitly via the lambda expression `x:@.continue`.
 *
 * 3. [.lambda]
 *    * Contains the loop body which executes during each iteration.
 *
 * 4. [log.info]
 *    * Logs the message "Condition is still true, iterating once more" every time the loop runs.
 *    * This serves as the observable action showing the loop is active.
