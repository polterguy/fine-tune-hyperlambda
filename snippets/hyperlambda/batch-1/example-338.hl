/*
 * Creates a conditional log entry based on the boolean value of [.flag].
 *
 * ### Initialization
 * - [.flag] is set to `true`.
 *
 * ### Conditional Logic
 * - [if] compares [.flag] to `true` using [eq].
 * - If the value is true:
 *   - [.lambda] executes and logs that [.flag] is enabled.
 * - [else] executes if [.flag] is not true, logging that [.flag] is disabled.
 *
 * This snippet illustrates basic conditional evaluation in Hyperlambda
 * and how to log different outcomes based on boolean input.
