/*
 * This snippet uses the [for-each] slot to iterate over all direct child nodes of the [.access_logs] node. 
 * The expression '@.access_logs/*' selects each child node (i.e., 'log1', 'log2', 'log3').
 * For each node in the collection, the loop body executes the [log.info] slot, logging the value of the current node.
 * The expression '@.dp/#' resolves to the value of the node currently being iterated.
 * This effectively logs each user activity message from the access logs.
