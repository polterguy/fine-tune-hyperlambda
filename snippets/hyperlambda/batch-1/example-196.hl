/*
 * Creates a scheduled task named [foo] that logs a message every Saturday and Sunday at 22:00 UTC.
 *
 * ### Task Definition
 * - [tasks.create] registers a task with the ID [foo].
 * - Inside the [.lambda] block, [log.info] logs a message indicating the task has executed.
 *
 * ### Scheduling
 * - [tasks.schedule] configures the [foo] task to run on:
 *   - Saturday at 22:00 UTC
 *   - Sunday at 22:00 UTC
 * - This is done using the [repeats] expression: `saturday|SUNDAY.22.00.00`
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to create time-based recurring tasks in Hyperlambda
 * that execute on specific days of the week at a specified hour.
