/*
 * This snippet decodes an HTML-encoded string using the [strings.html-decode] slot.
 *
 * 1. [.html]
 *    * Declares a node containing a string where special characters like `<` and `>` are HTML-encoded.
 *
 * 2. [`@.html`]
 *    * `@` is the named iterator, resolving the first node named [.html] in the current or parent scope.
 *    * Returns the HTML-encoded string as input for decoding.
 *
 * 3. [strings.html-decode]
 *    * Decodes HTML entities such as `&lt;` into their literal counterparts like `<`.
 *    * Useful when converting safe HTML strings back into readable or renderable content.
