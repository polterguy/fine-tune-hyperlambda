/*
 * Iterates through a list of numbers and finds the maximum value using a manual comparison approach.
 *
 * ## Initialization
 * - [.data] / [numbers] is a list of integers: 25, 78, 42, 91, and 66.
 * - [.max] is initialized to 0 and will hold the highest value found.
 *
 * ## Loop Logic
 * - [for-each] iterates over each item in [numbers] in the [.data] object.
 * - [if] checks if the current number (`.dp/#`) is greater than the current [.max] using [mt] (more than).
 * - If the condition is true, [set-value] updates [.max] with the current number.
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Demonstrates manual maximum value computation without relying on [math.max],
 *   useful for learning purposes or when combining additional custom logic during iteration.
