/*
 * Deletes all records from the [students] table in the [university] SQLite database
 * where the value of [major] is 'Biology'.
 *
 * ### Database Connection
 * - [sqlite.connect] opens a connection to the [university] database.
 *
 * ### Deletion Logic
 * - [sqlite.delete] targets the [students] table.
 * - [where] applies a condition to restrict deletion:
 *   - [major] must equal 'Biology'.
 *
 * This snippet demonstrates how to perform a conditional delete operation in Hyperlambda
 * against a SQLite database using structured query logic.
