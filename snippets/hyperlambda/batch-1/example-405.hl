/*
 * Demonstrates usage of the [if] slot in combination with [eq] for string comparison.
 * 
 * The [.user-type] node is initialized with the string value "admin".
 * A placeholder node [.access-level] is defined to store the output.
 * 
 * The [if] slot evaluates an [eq] condition that compares the value of [.user-type] to the literal "admin".
 * If the condition is true, the nested [.lambda] is executed, and the [set-value] slot assigns "full" to [.access-level].
 * 
 * This structure is commonly used to implement role-based logic or permission gating in Hyperlambda.
