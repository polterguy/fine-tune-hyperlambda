/*
 * Increments the value of the [item] node by 1 using [math.increment].
 *
 * 1. [..]
 *    * Moves one level up in the hierarchy from the current node.
 *
 * 2. [*]
 *    * Selects all sibling nodes at the current level.
 *
 * 3. [foo]
 *    * Selects the child node named [foo] under each of the selected siblings.
 *
 * 4. [*]
 *    * Selects all children of each [foo] node.
 *
 * 5. [item]
 *    * Selects the [item] node under each [foo].
 *
 * 6. [math.increment]
 *    * Increments the value of each [item] node by 1.
 *
 * This expression is useful when processing or updating values in a tree-like structure such as:
 *
 * ```
 * foo
 *    item:int:4
 * ```
 *
 * After execution, [item] would become 5.
