/*
 * Concatenate multiple strings with spaces between each word.
 *
 * 1. [.data]
 *    * Holds a collection of anonymous child nodes, each representing a word or part of the sentence.
 *
 * 2. [`x:-/*`]
 *    * `-` is the previous sibling iterator, and `/` is the path separator.
 *    * `*` selects all children of the previously declared [.data] node.
 *    * This resolves to all child nodes of [.data] for concatenation.
 *
 * 3. [strings.join]
 *    * Concatenates the values of the selected nodes using the space character `" "` as a separator.
 *
 * Result:
 * * Produces the string "I love Hyperlambda".
