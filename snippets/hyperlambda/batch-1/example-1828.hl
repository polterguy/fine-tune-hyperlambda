/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet recursively finds all nodes named 'foo' within a given [.data] structure,
 * extracts their values, and concatenates them into a single string using [strings.builder].
 *
 * 1. [.data]
 *    * Defines a hierarchical structure containing multiple 'foo' nodes, each at different depths.
 *
 * 2. [strings.builder]
 *    * Initializes a string builder that will accumulate values from all 'foo' nodes.
 *
 * 3. [for-each:x:@.data/**/foo]
 *    * Recursively searches for all descendant nodes named 'foo' using the [**] operator.
 *    * Iterates over each matching node.
 *
 * 4. [strings.builder.append:x:@.dp/#]
 *    * Appends the value of the current 'foo' node to the string builder.
 *    * [@.dp/#] ensures that the value (not the structure) is extracted.
 *
 * Result:
 * * After execution, the string builder will contain:
 *   "Hello world. This is cool"
 * * This is a concatenation of the values from all [foo] nodes in the [.data] structure.
