/*
 * Retrieves the body of a comment from a remote API and stores it in a [.comment_body] node.
 *
 * Breakdown:
 * - [http.get] performs an HTTP GET request to "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/1"
 *   to fetch a JSON representation of a single comment.
 * - [convert:true] ensures the JSON response is automatically converted into a lambda tree,
 *   making it easier to traverse and extract data using XPath-like expressions.
 *
 * - The comment's body text is then accessed from the converted response with the [get-value] invocation's expression leading
 *   to the content returned from the HTTP invocation, and specifically its [body] field.
 * - [set-value] stores the retrieved body text into the [.comment_body] node.
 *
 * This demonstrates how to perform an API call, parse the resulting JSON,
 * and extract a specific field value for use in subsequent logic.
