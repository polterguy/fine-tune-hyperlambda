/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to use a variable within the [if] slot
 * to evaluate a dynamic condition.
 *
 * 1. [.condition:bool:false]
 *    * Declares a boolean variable named [.condition] with the value false.
 *
 * 2. [.result]
 *    * Placeholder node that will store the output if the condition is met.
 *
 * 3. [if]
 *    * Begins a conditional block that evaluates the value of [.condition].
 *
 * 4. [get-value:x:@.condition]
 *    * Retrieves the boolean value of [.condition] dynamically for evaluation.
 *    * In this case, it resolves to false.
 *
 * 5. [.lambda]
 *    * Executes only if the evaluated condition is true.
 *    * Since the condition is false, this block is skipped.
 *
 * 6. [set-value]
 *    * Would set [.result] to "Condition met" if the condition evaluated to true.
 *
 * Result:
 * * Since [.condition] is false, [.result] remains unchanged and the [.lambda] is never executed.
