/*
 * Inserts a [second] element immediately after an existing [first] element inside the [.elements] node.
 *
 * ### Structure
 * - [.elements] contains a single child node named [first].
 *
 * ### Operation
 * - [insert-after] targets the [first] node with its expression.
 * - A new node named [second] with the value 'Added dynamically' is inserted directly after [first].
 *
 * This pattern is useful for maintaining ordered node structures
 * when dynamically injecting new content in Hyperlambda.
