/*
 * Uses the [or] logical operator to evaluate multiple conditions and executes a lambda
 * block if **any** of the conditions are true.
 *
 * ### Initialization
 * - [.result] is declared to hold the result of the condition evaluation.
 *
 * ### Conditional Logic
 * - [if] contains an [or] block with two boolean values:
 *   - The first is `true`
 *   - The second is `false`
 * - Since [or] returns true if **at least one** condition is true, the [.lambda] block will be executed.
 * 
 * ### Result Assignment
 * - [set-value] updates [.result] to "OK"
 *
 * This snippet demonstrates how to implement conditional branching using [or] to trigger
 * logic when **any** condition in a set evaluates to true.
