/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet reads a server log file and extracts all URLs from it using regular expressions.
 * If the file doesn't exist, an error is logged instead.
 *
 * 1. [if io.file.exists:/var/logs/server.log]
 *    * Checks whether the log file exists at the specified path.
 *    * If true, executes the inner [.lambda]; otherwise, logs an error.
 *
 * 2. [io.file.load]
 *    * Loads the content of the log file as a string.
 *
 * 3. [.urls]
 *    * Declares a temporary node to store all extracted URLs.
 *
 * 4. [strings.matches]
 *    * Uses a regular expression to match all valid HTTP and HTTPS URLs from the file content.
 *    * The regex supports common URL patterns and special characters.
 *
 * 5. [for-each:x:@strings.matches/*/match]
 *    * Iterates over all matched URL segments.
 *    * [unwrap] ensures the value can be directly retrieved.
 *    * [add] inserts each matched URL into the [.urls] node as a new child.
 *
 * 6. [lambda2hyper:x:@.urls/*]
 *    * Converts the list of matched URLs into a lambda representation.
 *
 * 7. [log.info]
 *    * Logs the extracted URLs in human-readable format for debugging or tracking.
 *    * Includes the converted lambda as part of the log message.
 *
 * 8. [else log.error]
 *    * Executes if the file is not found and logs a relevant error message.
 *
 * Result:
 * * Successfully extracts and logs all URLs found in the server log, or logs an error if the file is missing.
