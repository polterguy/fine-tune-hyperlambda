/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to subtract multiple values from a base value using [math.subtract],
 * where one of the values is the result of a nested [math.add] operation.

 * 1. [math.subtract]
 *    - Performs a sequential subtraction operation, starting from the base value (30 in this case).
 *    - Each child value is subtracted in order from the intermediate result of the previous subtraction.

 * 2. [math.add]
 *    - Computes the sum of two integers (5 and 3), resulting in 8.
 *    - This sum becomes the first value subtracted from the base (30 - 8 = 22).

 * 3. Literal [int] node
 *    - Represents the second value subtracted (2), resulting in the final value (22 - 2 = 20).

math.subtract:int:30

   // compute a sum to subtract
   math.add

      // first addend
      .:int:5

      // second addend (5 + 3 = 8)
      .:int:3

   // subtract 2 after subtracting the above sum
   .:int:2

   // Step-by-step: 30 - 8 = 22, then 22 - 2 = 20
