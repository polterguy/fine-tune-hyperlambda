/*
 * Inserts a [log2] entry immediately after [log1] within the [.logs] node.
 *
 * ### Structure
 * - [.logs] contains an existing child node [log1].
 *
 * ### Operation
 * - [insert-after] targets [log1].
 * - The new node [log2] with the value 'Next log entry' is inserted as a sibling following [log1].
 *
 * This pattern is useful for maintaining ordered node structures where sequence matters.
