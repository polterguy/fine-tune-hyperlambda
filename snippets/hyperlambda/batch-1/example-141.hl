/*
 * Adds child nodes to an existing [.dest] node located at the root level.
 *
 * ### Structure
 * - [.dest] is initialized at the root level to serve as the destination container.
 *
 * ### Operation
 * - [add] targets [.dest] with its expression.
 * - A block of new child nodes is added to [.dest], including:
 *   - [foo1] with value 'bar1'
 *   - [foo2] with value 'bar2'
 *
 * This demonstrates how to use [add] with a relative lambda expression
 * to populate a node dynamically from nearby context in the tree.
