/*
 * Appends the string 'hello' three times into the [.greetings] list node using a [while] loop.
 *
 * ## Initialization
 * - [.times] is initialized to 0 and acts as a loop counter.
 * - [.greetings] is the target list that will store repeated 'hello' messages.
 *
 * ## Loop Logic
 * - [while] continues looping as long as [.times] is less than 3.
 * - [lt] compares the current [.times] value to 3.
 *
 * ## Loop Body
 * - [add] appends a new object to the [.greetings] list with:
 *   - [message] with 'hello' as its value.
 * - [math.increment] increases [.times] by 1 to progress the loop.
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Useful for constructing repeated patterns, generating mock data, or initializing default list entries.
