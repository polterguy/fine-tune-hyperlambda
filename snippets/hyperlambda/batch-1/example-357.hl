/*
 * Demonstrates the use of the [convert] slot with a deliberately invalid type to showcase error behavior.
 *
 * 1. [.src]:int:5
 *    * Declares a node named [.src] with a value of integer 5.
 *
 * 2. [convert]
 *    * Attempts to convert the value of [.src] to a specified type.
 *
 * 3. [type]:non-existing-type
 *    * An invalid or undefined type name is supplied here.
 *    * This will result in an exception being thrown during execution because the type is not recognized.
 *
 * Use cases:
 * * Validating error handling behavior when an unsupported or incorrect type is used.
 * * Testing robustness of workflows relying on strict typing.
