/*
 * Iterates over each child node of [.list] and sets its value to 'processed'.
 *
 * ### Data Structure
 * - [.list] contains multiple unnamed or named child nodes (e.g., [item1], [item2]).
 *
 * ### Loop Logic
 * - [for-each] targets each child node of [.list].
 * - [set-value] is used to update the value of the current node (referenced by `x:@.dp/#`) to 'processed'.
 *
 * This pattern is commonly used in Hyperlambda to apply batch updates to collections of nodes.
