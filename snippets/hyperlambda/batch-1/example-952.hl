/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet defines a function that returns all enabled clusters in the system.
 * It includes HTTP caching headers to reduce server load and mitigate potential denial-of-service (DOS) attacks.
 *
 * 1. [response.headers.set]
 *    * Sets the HTTP response header [Cache-Control] to "public, max-age=30".
 *    * Instructs clients and proxies to cache the response for 30 seconds.
 *    * Helps reduce repeated load on the server from frequent or malicious requests.
 *
 * 2. [data.connect]
 *    * Opens a connection to the [hub] database using a [generic] connection string.
 *
 * 3. [data.read]
 *    * Reads data from the [clusters] table.
 *    * Filters the results to include only those clusters where [enabled] is true.
 *    * Returns specific columns: [id], [country], and [name].
 *
 * 4. [return-nodes]
 *    * Returns the records fetched by [data.read] to the caller.
 *    * Uses a lambda expression to extract all result nodes from the query.
