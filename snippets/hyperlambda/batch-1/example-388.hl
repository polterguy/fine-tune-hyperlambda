/*
 * Demonstrates strict equality comparison using the [eq] slot, where both value and type must match.
 *
 * - [.a] is defined as a string with value "5" (default type is string).
 * - [.b] is defined explicitly as an integer with value 5.
 * - [eq] compares these two using [get-value].
 * 
 * Since the types differ (string vs. int), [eq] evaluates to false,
 * even though the underlying numeric values are the same.
 *
 * This highlights [eq]'s behavior of requiring both value and type equality.
