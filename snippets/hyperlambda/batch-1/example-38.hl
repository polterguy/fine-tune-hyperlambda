/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet dynamically composes an expression that fetches the first child of the previous [data.read] node.
 *
 * 1. [compose]
 *    * Builds a dynamic lambda expression from multiple parts.
 *    * The final result is a single expression string that can be used in other dynamic evaluation contexts.

 * 2. [.:@data.read]
 *    * Adds the `@data.read` part to the composed expression.
 *    * The `@` named iterator fetches the first node named [data.read] upwards in the tree.

 * 3. [.:*]
 *    * Appends the `*` wildcard to the composed expression.
 *    * This retrieves all children of the [data.read] node.

 * 4. [.:[0,1]]
 *    * Appends the `[0,1]` lambda filtering segment to the expression.
 *    * This selects the first child (at index 0) from the node set.
