/*
 * Accesses a sibling node named [meta] by first navigating through a known sibling [.foo],
 * then using the `+` (next sibling) operator to reach the next node.
 * Named `meta` iterator ensure its name is "meta".
 *
 * ### Expression: `@.foo/+/meta`
 * - `@.foo` selects the [.foo] node relative to the current context by traversing upwards in the node hierarchy.
 * - `+` moves to the next sibling node after [.foo].
 * - `meta` ensure its name is "meta"
 *
 * This technique is useful when you need to access a node that is a sibling of another known node,
 * especially in scenarios where you don't know the full structure but can rely on relative positioning.
 *
 * **Example structure for reference:**
 * ```
 * .foo
 * meta
 * ```
