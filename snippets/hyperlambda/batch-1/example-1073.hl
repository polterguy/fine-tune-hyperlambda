 * If [.foo1] has no children, [for-each] should not execute the [foo2] slot.
 *
 * 1. [.foo1]
 *    * Declares a node without any children.
 *
 * 2. [for-each]
 *    * Attempts to iterate over all children of the [.foo1] node.
 *    * Since [.foo1] has no children, the loop body is skipped entirely.
 *
 * 3. [foo2]
 *    * This slot would execute inside the loop if [.foo1] had children.
 *    * However, because there are no children, this line is never reached or executed.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The [foo2] slot is never called due to an empty iteration target.
