/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to insert a new node named [task2]
 * immediately after an existing node named [task1] inside the [.tasks] container.
 *
 * 1. [.tasks]
 *    - A node that contains [task1] as an initial child.
 *
 * 2. [insert-after]
 *    - Inserts the specified content after the node [task1].
 *    - The lambda path targets the [task1] node inside [.tasks].
 *
 * 3. Inner [.]
 *    - Declares a new node named [task2] with the value "Next task in queue".
 *
 * Result:
 *    - The structure becomes:
 *      .tasks
 *         task1
 *         task2:Next task in queue
