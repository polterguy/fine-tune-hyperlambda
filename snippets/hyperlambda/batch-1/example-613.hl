/*
 * Checks if a user's age is greater than or equal to 18 using [mte] (more than or equal),
 * and grants access if the condition is met.
 *
 * ## Initialization
 * - [.age] is set to 19 as an integer.
 * - [.access-status] is the node that will hold the result of the access evaluation.
 *
 * ## Conditional Logic
 * - [if] uses [mte] to compare [.age] against the minimum required age of 18.
 * - If the condition is true, [.access-status] is set to 'allowed' using [set-value].
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Commonly used in access control scenarios such as age-restricted content,
 *   voting eligibility, or membership gating based on numerical thresholds.
