/*
 * Updates the value of the [foo] node located deep within a nested structure to 'hello'.
 *
 * ### Data Structure
 * - [.data] contains a nested hierarchy: [n1] → [n2] → [n3] → [foo].
 * - Initially, [foo] holds the value 'howdy'.
 *
 * ### Operation
 * - [set-value] targets the [foo] node using its expression.
 * - The value of [foo] is updated to 'hello'.
 *
 * This demonstrates how to traverse a deeply nested structure and update a specific node's value
 * using precise path expressions in Hyperlambda.
