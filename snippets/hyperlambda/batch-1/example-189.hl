/*
 * Executes conditional logic based on whether [.message] is different from 'Welcome Home'.
 *
 * ### Initialization
 * - [.message] is assigned the value 'Welcome Home'.
 *
 * ### Conditional Logic
 * - [if] uses [neq] to check if the value of [.message] is not equal to 'Welcome Home'.
 * - If the condition is true:
 *   - [.lambda] runs and [log.info] logs that [.message] is not 'Welcome Home'.
 * - [else] runs when the value is exactly 'Welcome Home' and logs that.
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to handle conditional branching based on
 * string inequality in Hyperlambda.
