/*
 * Demonstrates how to use [not-null] inside an [if] condition to trigger logic based on the presence of a value.
 *
 * ## Structure & Logic
 * - [.data] / [foo] is set to "bar", meaning the node exists and is not null.
 * - [if] checks whether the [foo] node is not null using [not-null].
 * - Since [foo] has a value, the condition evaluates to true.
 * - As a result, the [.lambda] block executes and [throw] raises an exception with a custom message.
 *
 * ## Behavior
 * - This results in an intentional exception: "You are not supposed to be here!"
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Useful for enforcing logic paths that should only be executed when required values exist,
 *   or for testing presence guards and exception handling in workflows.
