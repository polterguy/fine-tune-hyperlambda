/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet connects to a MySQL database and inserts a new record into the 'books' table.
 * It demonstrates the use of MySQL-specific CRUD slots for data creation.

 * 1. [mysql.connect]
 *    - Establishes a connection to the MySQL database named 'library'.
 *    - All subsequent MySQL operations must be scoped within this node to utilize the active connection.

 * 2. [mysql.create]
 *    - Executes a SQL INSERT statement to add a new record to the 'books' table.
 *    - The [values] node provides key-value pairs for each column being inserted, including:
 *      - 'title' with the book's title.
 *      - 'author' with the author's name.
 *      - 'year' as a strongly typed integer representing the publication year.
