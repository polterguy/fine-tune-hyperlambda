/*
 * This Hyperlambda endpoint returns the number of log items matching a given query.
 * It uses role-based access control and a built-in logging utility for query-based counting.
 * 
 * 1. [validators.mandatory]
 *    - Ensures the 'query' argument is provided by the caller.
 *    - Prevents execution with missing input data.
 * 
 * 2. [auth.ticket.verify]
 *    - Restricts access to users with the 'root' role.
 *    - Enforces secure access using JWT-based authentication.
 * 
 * 3. [log.count]
 *    - Executes a search in the log system using the provided query.
 *    - Returns the number of matching log entries found in the log database.
 * 
 * 4. [yield]
 *    - Returns the result of the [log.count] operation to the caller in the form of a [count] node.
