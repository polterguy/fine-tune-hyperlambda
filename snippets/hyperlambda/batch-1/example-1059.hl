/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to publish a socket message
 * to multiple users using [sockets.signal].
 *
 * 1. [sockets.signal]
 *    * Publishes a socket signal with the topic 'foo.bar'.
 *    * Can be handled by clients subscribed to this signal on the frontend.
 *
 * 2. [users]
 *    * Specifies a comma-separated list of user identifiers who will receive the signal.
 *    * In this case: 'user1', 'user2', and 'user3'.
 *
 * 3. [args]
 *    * Defines the payload or arguments that accompany the signal.
 *    * Here, it sends a key-value pair: [howdy] with a 'world' value.
 *
 * Use Case:
 * * Useful for broadcasting real-time messages to specific authenticated users,
 *   such as updates, notifications, or chat messages.
