/*
 * Evaluates the user's age to determine if they are an adult, then sets the [.status] node accordingly.
 *
 * 1. The [.user] node contains the user's name and age (e.g., 'John Doe', 22).
 * 2. [if] uses the [mte] (more than or equal) slot to check if the user's age is >= 18.
 *    - [mte:x:@.user/*/age] retrieves and compares the user's age against 18.
 * 3. If the condition evaluates to true, [.lambda] sets [.status] to 'Adult'.
 * 4. If the condition is false, the [else] branch sets [.status] to 'Minor'.
 *
 * This logic is typically used for access control, categorization, or legal validation purposes.
