/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet checks if the user's age is 18 or older.
 * If true, it updates the [.status] node with "Adult". Otherwise, it sets it to "Minor".
 *
 * ### Data Structure
 * - [.user] holds the user's information, including:
 *   - [name]: John Doe
 *   - [age]: 22
 * - [.status] is initialized as an empty node that will store the result.
 *
 * ### Conditional Logic
 * - [if] checks if [age] is greater than or equal to 18 using [mte].
 * - If true:
 *   - [set-value] assigns the string "Adult" to [.status].
 * - Otherwise:
 *   - [set-value] assigns "Minor" instead.
 *
 * This snippet is a practical example of how to use conditionals in Hyperlambda
 * to evaluate data and set derived values based on logic.
