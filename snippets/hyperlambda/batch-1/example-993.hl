/*
 * Endpoint deleting one record from your [Categories] table in your [northwind] SQLite database.
 *
 * 1. [.arguments]
 *    * Accepts one mandatory input: [CategoryID], which identifies the record to be deleted.
 *
 * 2. [validators.mandatory]
 *    * Ensures that [CategoryID] is provided by the caller before attempting deletion.
 *
 * 3. [data.connect]
 *    * Opens a connection to the [northwind] database using a [generic] connection string.
 *    * Declares the database type explicitly as [sqlite].
 *
 * 4. [add]
 *    * Dynamically injects the [CategoryID] argument into the WHERE clause of [data.delete].
 *    * Uses [get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*] to fetch the condition(s).
 *
 * 5. [data.delete]
 *    * Executes the delete operation on the [Categories] table.
 *    * The WHERE clause ensures only the specified record is deleted.
 *
 * 6. [unwrap]
 *    * Makes the result of [data.delete] accessible at the root level for use in the [return] block.
 *
 * 7. [return]
 *    * Returns a response containing the number of records affected by the delete operation.
 *    * The [affected] node holds the result value from [data.delete].
