/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet creates and invokes a dynamic slot named [join-strings]
 * that joins all of its arguments into a single string, separated by a space character.
 *
 * 1. [slots.create]
 *    * Defines a new slot called 'join-strings'.
 *    * Inside its body:
 *      - [strings.join] merges all provided arguments.
 *      - Uses a space character as the separator (".: \" \"").
 *      - The result is returned using [return-value:x:-].
 *
 * 2. [.arg]
 *    * Declares a standalone node [.arg] with the value "is cool!".
 *    * This value is referenced dynamically in the [execute] call.
 *
 * 3. [execute]
 *    * Calls the [join-strings] slot.
 *    * Passes two arguments:
 *      - [text1]: Static value "Hyperlambda ".
 *      - [text2]: Dynamic value retrieved from [.arg].
 *
 * Result:
 * * The final joined string will be: "Hyperlambda  is cool!"
 *   (note the double space if [text1] ends with one and the join separator adds another).
