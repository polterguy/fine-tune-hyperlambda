/*
 * This example demonstrates how to convert an image file from one format to another using [image.convert].
 *
 * 1. [file:/input.jpg]
 *    * Specifies the source image to convert. The node's name is [file], and its value is the path to the input file.

 * 2. [output:/output.png]
 *    * Declares the destination file path and filename where the converted image will be saved. The format of the output image is determined by the extension (e.g., "png").

 * 3. [image.convert]
 *    * This slot converts the input image at [file] to a new format and stores it as specified in [output].
