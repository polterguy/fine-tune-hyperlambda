/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to use the [or] slot to check multiple conditions
 * and execute logic if at least one of them evaluates to true.
 *
 * 1. [.result]
 *    * Placeholder node to store the result if a condition matches.
 *
 * 2. [.foo1]
 *    * Contains a string value 'OK' that will be evaluated in the conditional check.
 *
 * 3. [if]
 *    * Begins a conditional statement that executes its [.lambda] block if the [or] condition is true.
 *
 * 4. [or]
 *    * Logical OR condition that evaluates to true if at least one of its children evaluates to true.
 *
 * 5. [eq]
 *    * The first [eq] checks if [.foo1] equals 'OK'.
 *    * The second [eq] checks if [.foo1] equals 'ERROR'.
 *    * Only one of these needs to be true for the [or] to pass.
 *
 * 6. [.lambda]
 *    * Executes only if the [or] condition is true.
 *    * Sets the value of [.result] to 'MATCH'.
