/*
 * This Hyperlambda script creates a grouped bar chart and saves it as an image file.
 * It visually compares seasonal data across three categories (Phones, Computers, Tablets),
 * using a grouped format where bars for each category are aligned side-by-side per group.
 *
 * 1. [image.chart]
 *    * Specifies the chart type as "grouped", where values are displayed in grouped columns.
 *    * [filename]: Specifies the output image path as "/chart.png".
 *    * [width] and [height]: Set the dimensions of the image in pixels.
 *
 * 2. [bars]
 *    * Declares the groups "Spring", "Summer", and "Autumn".
 *    * Each group contains three integer values corresponding to different product categories.
 *    * These values are rendered as bars in each group.
 *
 * 3. [legend]
 *    * Provides labels for the three categories represented in each group of bars.
 *    * The order corresponds to the bar order within each group:
 *      - Phones, Computers, Tablets.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The output is a grouped chart image (600x300 pixels), showing grouped bars for each season,
 *   visually categorized by legend entries.
