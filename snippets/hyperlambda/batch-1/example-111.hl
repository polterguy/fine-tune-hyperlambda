 * This snippet filters a string to only include letters (uppercase and lowercase) and spaces by removing all other characters.
 *
 * 1. [.phrase]
 *    * Declares a node named [.phrase] with the value 'Hello, World!'.
 *
 * 2. [strings.replace-not-of]
 *    * Removes all characters from the string that are NOT part of the allowed characters.
 *    * The first argument (".:") specifies which characters are allowed:
 *      - 'A-Z', 'a-z', and space.
 *    * The second argument (".:"") specifies the replacement string, which is an empty string, effectively removing unwanted characters.
 *    * The resulting string will be 'Hello World'.
