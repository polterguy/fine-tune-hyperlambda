/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates an [if] statement that checks multiple conditions
 * using [and], and performs an action if all conditions are true.
 *
 * 1. [.user-role], [.subscription], [.days-left]
 *    * Declare input values representing user account status:
 *    * - [.user-role]: Expected to be "premium".
 *    * - [.subscription]: Expected to be "active".
 *    * - [.days-left]: Expected to be less than 7.
 *
 * 2. [.user-message]
 *    * Placeholder node for output message if conditions are met.
 *
 * 3. [if] with [and]
 *    * Evaluates multiple conditions:
 *    * - [eq:x:@.user-role]: Must be equal to "premium".
 *    * - [eq:x:@.subscription]: Must be "active".
 *    * - [lt:x:@.days-left]: Must be less than 7.
 *    * All conditions must be true for the [.lambda] to execute.
 *
 * 4. [.lambda]
 *    * Executed only if all the above conditions are true.
 *
 * 5. [set-value]
 *    * Sets [.user-message] to "Subscription expires soon" if the condition block passes.
 *
 * Result:
 * * If the user is a premium member with an active subscription and less than 7 days left,
 *   the [.user-message] node will contain a warning message.
