 * Adds two decimal financial balances from a user and stores the result in [.totals.sum].
 *
 * ## Initialization
 * - [.user] / [balance1] is set to 125.75.
 * - [.user] / [balance2] is set to 320.50.
 * - [.totals] / [sum] is the target node where the computed sum will be stored.
 *
 * ## Calculation
 * - [math.add] performs the addition of both balances using [get-value] to resolve each.
 * - [set-value] writes the result of the addition into [.totals.sum].
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Useful for calculating a userâ€™s combined account balance, merging wallet totals,
 *   or performing basic financial summaries in data workflows.
