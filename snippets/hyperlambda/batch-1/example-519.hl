/*
 * Connects to the 'company' PostgreSQL database and updates the salary of a specific employee in the 'employees' table.
 *
 * ## Database Connection
 * - [pgsql.connect] establishes a connection to the 'company' database using the PostgreSQL provider.
 *
 * ## Update Operation
 * - [pgsql.update] modifies one or more rows in the 'employees' table.
 * - [values] sets the [salary] column to 75000 (as a decimal).
 * - [where] clause restricts the update to rows where [employee_id] is exactly 303.
 *
 * ## Use Case
 * - Suitable for HR tools, admin panels, or automation scripts where specific employee data must be updated conditionally.
 * - Demonstrates a safe and targeted SQL update operation without affecting unrelated records.
