/*
 * Example: Concatenate a string and a number (the number is converted to a string).
 *
 * 1. [.number]
 *    * Declares a node named [.number] with an integer value of 42.
 *
 * 2. [get-value:x:@.number]
 *    * Retrieves the value of the [.number] node using the named iterator `@`.
 *    * `@.number` resolves the first node named [.number] upwards from the current context.
 *    * [get-value] extracts the value (42) from that node.
 *
 * 3. [strings.concat]
 *    * Concatenates the static string "Answer: " with the retrieved numeric value.
 *    * The integer is automatically converted to a string during concatenation.
 *    * The result is the string: "Answer: 42".
 *
 * Use cases:
 * * Formatting output messages that include numeric data.
 * * Creating dynamic strings for logs, UI, or responses.
