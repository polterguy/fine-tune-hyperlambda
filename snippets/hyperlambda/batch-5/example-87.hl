/*
 * Imports external partner company data and links each company to its CRM profile via database lookup.
 *
 * ## Slot Documentation
 *
 * - [io.file.load]
 *   Loads `/partners.json`, which is expected to contain an array of external partner profiles with a [crm_id] field.
 *
 * - [.partners]
 *   Stores the deserialized JSON records, which are later updated with internal CRM data.
 *
 * - [add]
 *   Converts the JSON content into Hyperlambda nodes using [json2lambda] and attaches the result to [.partners].
 *
 * - [data.connect]
 *   Connects to the [crm] database, required for all SQL operations scoped under this node.
 *
 * - [for-each]
 *   Loops through each partner record to look up and attach internal CRM profile details.
 *
 * - [add]
 *   Appends the query result from [data.read] into each current partner record node.
 *
 * - [data.read]
 *   Fetches company profile data from the [companies] table where [id] matches the provided [crm_id].
 *
 * ## Summary
 * This Hyperlambda script performs a merge between static partner records and live CRM data.
 * It ensures each company from the file is linked to internal system data using the [crm_id] field.
