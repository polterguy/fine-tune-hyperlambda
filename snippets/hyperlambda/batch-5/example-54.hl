 *
 * ## Slot Documentation
 *
 * - [.team]
 *   A list of team members. Each record has:
 *   - [name]: Full name.
 *   - [department]: Their department.
 *   This data is mock employee records from various departments.
 *
 * - [set-value]
 *   Sets the [name] of all people in "Engineering" to "Engineer X".
 *
 *   - `@.team` moves to the [.team] node.
 *   - `*` iterates over each member object.
 *   - `*` moves inside fields like [name] and [department].
 *   - `department` filters out only those with name [department].
 *   - `=Engineering` restricts to values of "Engineering".
 *   - `.` walks up to the parent member node.
 *   - `*` gets its children again.
 *   - `name` isolates the name field.
 *
 * - New Value
 *   A static rename is applied to match all "Engineering" members.
 *

 * or enforcing naming conventions on conditionally matched records.
