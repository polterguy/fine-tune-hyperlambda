/*
 * This Hyperlambda endpoint statically defines a list of conference speakers and yields them to the client.
 *
 * ## Slot Documentation
 *
 * - [.arguments]
 *   Declares that this Hyperlambda file is a valid HTTP endpoint. While no input arguments are required,
 *   this node is necessary to ensure the file can be invoked externally.
 *
 * - [.speakers]
 *   Contains a hardcoded collection of speaker objects. Each child node represents a speaker with two fields:
 *   - [name]: Full name of the speaker.
 *   - [topic]: The subject the speaker will present or discuss.
 *   This data is intended to simulate a static response for listing participants in a conference or seminar.
 *
 * - [yield]
 *   Returns the list of speaker nodes directly to the caller. The lambda expression `x:@.speakers/*` selects all
 *   child nodes under [.speakers], resulting in a clean array of speaker records as the HTTP response payload.
 *
 * ## Summary
 * This code defines a simple and static data response for use in scenarios such as mock API development,
 * frontend testing, or documentation. It demonstrates the use of [yield] to return structured data directly
 * and the use of scoped lambda expressions to access nested nodes within Hyperlambda.
