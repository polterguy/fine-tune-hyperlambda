/*
 * Inserts a [grade] node before the [name] field in the second student record.
 *
 * ## Slot Documentation
 *
 * - [.students]
 *   A static dataset containing student records. Each unnamed child represents one student with:
 *   - [name]: The full name of the student.
 *   - [email]: The student's contact email.
 *   - [id]: A unique identifier.
 *
 * - [insert-before]
 *   Inserts a new [grade] field before [name] in the second record (index 1).
 *   The selector uses:
 *   - `@.students`: Finds the [.students] node.
 *   - `/1`: Selects the second student.
 *   - `*`: Gets all fields of that student.
 *   - `/name`: Narrows down to the [name] field.
 *
 *   The resulting node will now include a [grade:A] field before the [name] property.
 *
 * ## Summary
 * This example demonstrates modifying node trees using positional access,
 * allowing you to enrich static data collections dynamically.
