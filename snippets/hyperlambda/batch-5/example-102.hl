/*
 * This example shows a conditional read operation using the [if] slot with shorthand syntax.
 *
 * The [data.read] slot retrieves records from the 'users' table, limited to 5 entries.
 * However, the read only happens if the [fetch_users] flag is true, as evaluated by [if:x:@.fetch_users].
 *
 * The [data.read] slot must be wrapped inside [data.connect], which connects to the 'appdb' database.
 *
 * Result: If [fetch_users] is true, 5 records are read from the 'users' table.
