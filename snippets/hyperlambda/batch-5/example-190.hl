/*
 * This slot loads a file from disk and splits its contents into individual lines.
 *
 * [slots.create]
 *   - Declares a reusable logic block named 'file.read-lines'.
 *
 * [validators.mandatory]
 *   - Ensures the 'path' argument is present. Without a file path, [io.file.load] would fail.
 *
 * [io.file.load]
 *   - Loads the contents of the file located at the given path. The result is a single string.
 *
 * [strings.split]
 *   - Splits the file contents into lines using the newline character ('\\n') as the delimiter.
 *
 * [unwrap]
 *   - Ensures all expressions are resolved before returning the list.
 *
 * [return]
 *   - Returns the split result as an array of lines.
