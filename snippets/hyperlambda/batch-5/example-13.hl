/*
 * This Hyperlambda file enriches course records from the 'university' database with related enrollment data
 * pulled from JSON files stored locally on the server.
 *
 * [data.connect]
 * Connects to the 'university' database to access the 'Courses' table.
 *
 * [data.read]
 * Selects the top 50 courses and retrieves only the 'CourseId' and 'CourseTitle' fields for efficiency.
 *
 * [include]
 * Iterates over each course and uses [strings.concat] to construct a file path such as '/data/enrollments/101.json'
 * based on the course ID.
 *
 * [io.file.load]
 * Reads the file from disk which contains pre-generated JSON data of student enrollments per course.
 *
 * [json2lambda]
 * Converts the raw JSON string into a Hyperlambda node tree.
 *
 * [yield]
 * Adds the parsed enrollments under each course object as a child node named 'enrollments'.
