/*
 * Removes a subset of events from the [.calendar] node using a **numeric subtree iterator**.
 *
 * ## Slot Documentation
 *
 * - [.calendar]
 *   A hardcoded list of upcoming calendar events. Each event record contains:
 *   - [title]: The name of the event.
 *   - [date]: The date of the event.
 *   - [location]: The event location.
 *   There are four total entries to simulate a schedule.
 *
 * - [remove-nodes]
 *   This slot uses a lambda expression to delete a slice of nodes from the [.calendar] list.
 *
 *   Expression breakdown:
 *   - `@.calendar`: Locates the parent node.
 *   - `*`: Selects all children (i.e., the individual event entries).
 *   - `[1,2]`: Selects **two nodes**, starting at index `1` (the second event).
 *     This will delete the **second and third** events from the list.
 *
 * ## Summary
 * This snippet illustrates the use of numeric subtree iterators to remove a middle segment
 * of structured list data. This is useful when trimming events, paginating results,
 * or excluding specific records based on positional index.
