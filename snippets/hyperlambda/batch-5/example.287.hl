/*
 * This endpoint retrieves order records from the [Orders] table in the [logisticsDB] database.
 *
 * Clients can optionally control the order of results using:
 *
 * - [sort]: Column name such as "createdAt" or "status".
 * - [direction]: Sort order, either "asc" or "desc".
 *
 * The [add] slot only applies these parameters if they exist, meaning the endpoint
 * will return results in default order when no sorting input is provided.
 *
 * This setup provides full flexibility to consumer apps, allowing them to sort dynamically.
