/*
 * Strips the [rating] field from all books in the [.library] list using [for-each].
 *
 * ## Slot Documentation
 *
 * - [.library]
 *   A predefined set of book records. Each book node contains:
 *   - [title]: The title of the book.
 *   - [author]: The author's name.
 *   - [rating]: A numeric score representing the book's rating.
 *   The data simulates a small bookshelf or reading list.
 *
 * - [for-each]
 *   Iterates over each book using `x:@.library/*`, where [.dp] points to the current book in the loop.
 *
 * - [remove-nodes]
 *   Removes the [rating] node from each book by evaluating:
 *   - `@.dp`: Points to the current book.
 *   - `#`: Ensures access by reference.
 *   - `*`: Gets all children nodes.
 *   - `rating`: Selects the node named `rating`.
 *   These matching nodes are then removed from the tree.
 *
 * ## Summary
 * This demonstrates field-level cleansing of structured data using [for-each] and [remove-nodes].
 * Useful when the [rating] field is irrelevant or must be excluded from downstream processing.
