/*
 * This Hyperlambda file shows how to enrich author data with external statistics
 * from a public API using [for-each] and [add].
 *
 * [data.connect]
 * Connects to the 'bookstore' database to fetch author data.
 *
 * [data.read]
 * Retrieves the first 50 authors, selecting 'AuthorId' and 'Name'.
 *
 * [for-each]
 * Iterates over each author record.
 *
 * - [http.get] calls an external API ('https://api.bookstats.org/author/metrics') using 'AuthorId' as the query param.
 *
 * - The API response is parsed and its contents are extracted using [get-nodes].
 *
 * - The extracted metrics are grouped under a child node named 'metrics' and added to each author record.
 *
 * [yield]
 * Outputs the enriched author list under the 'enriched' node.
