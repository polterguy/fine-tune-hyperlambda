/*
 * This Hyperlambda file returns a static list of academic courses from a sample course catalog.
 *
 * ## Slot Documentation
 *
 * - [.arguments]
 *   Declares this node as a web-accessible endpoint. No parameters are expected.
 *
 * - [.courses]
 *   A hardcoded set of course objects, each containing:
 *   - [code]: The course code identifier.
 *   - [title]: The course title.
 *   Simulates a course listing for use in mock APIs or integration testing.
 *
 * - [yield]
 *   Returns the full set of course records as an array. Uses `x:@.courses/*` to select all items.
 *
 * ## Summary
 * Demonstrates how to use [yield] to expose static academic data in API format using Hyperlambda.
 * Ideal for API simulations, mocks, or prototype data exposure.
