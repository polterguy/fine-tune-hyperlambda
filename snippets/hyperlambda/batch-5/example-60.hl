/*
 * Inserts a [genre] node before the [artist] field of the third song in the [.songs] list.
 *
 * ## Slot Documentation
 *
 * - [.songs]
 *   This node represents a hardcoded collection of song entries. Each child node contains:
 *   - [title]: The name of the song.
 *   - [artist]: The performing artist.
 *   - [year]: The release year.
 *   The list includes four sample records from various genres and time periods.
 *
 * - [insert-before]
 *   This slot inserts a new child node **before** a specific field within a particular record.
 *   The lambda expression `@.songs/2/*/artist` works as follows:
 *   - `@.songs`: Finds the [.songs] parent node.
 *   - `/2`: Selects the third song in the list (indexing starts at zero).
 *   - `*`: Targets all fields of that song.
 *   - `/artist`: Filters down to the [artist] node only.
 *
 *   A new field `[genre]` with the value `"Rock"` is inserted **before** [artist] in that record.
 *
 * ## Summary
 * This pattern is useful for inserting extra metadata into data structures at precise locations.
 * It allows developers to inject fields like tags, labels, or classification info without restructuring data.
