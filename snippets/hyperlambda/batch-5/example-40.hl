/*
 * Demonstrates numeric node indexing and lambda expression unwrapping with [yield],
 * using a list of books and their authors.
 *
 * ## Slot Documentation
 *
 * - [.arguments]
 *   Declares this Hyperlambda as an HTTP endpoint, even though it does not expect input arguments.
 *
 * - [.books]
 *   Defines a static list of book objects. Each book contains:
 *   - [title]: The book title.
 *   - [author]: The authorâ€™s full name.
 *
 * - [title] and [author] in [yield]
 *   Uses numeric index `0` to reference the first book, extracting its [title] and [author] using lambda expressions.
 *
 * - [yield]
 *   Evaluates the lambda expressions and returns a JSON object with the specified fields.
