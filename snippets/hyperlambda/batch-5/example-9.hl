/*
 * This Hyperlambda file demonstrates a pattern where publisher data is fetched from a relational database
 * and enriched with book data retrieved via an external HTTP API, creating a master-detail structure.
 *
 * [data.connect]
 * Connects to the 'bookdata' database and enables data access to the 'Publishers' table.
 *
 * [data.read]
 * Fetches the top 50 publishers, selecting only 'PublisherId' and 'PublisherName'.
 *
 * [include]
 * For each publisher, uses [http.get] to retrieve their associated books from an external book catalog service.
 *
 * [http.get]
 * Calls 'https://api.bookworld.io/catalog/books' with a query param 'publisher' set to the publisher's ID.
 * The API result is automatically converted into Hyperlambda structure using [convert:true].
 *
 * [yield]
 * Enriches each publisher node with a child 'books' node containing the API response data.
