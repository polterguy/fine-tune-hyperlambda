/*
 * This endpoint demonstrates how to extract the second element from a collection using a numeric index.
 *
 * ## Slot Documentation
 *
 * - [.arguments]
 *   Declares this as a valid HTTP endpoint. It accepts no parameters but must exist to expose the file as callable.
 *
 * - [.courses]
 *   Contains two hardcoded course entries, each with:
 *   - [code]: Unique identifier for the course.
 *   - [title]: A descriptive course title.
 *
 * - [yield]
 *   Evaluates expressions beneath it. The expression `x:@.courses/1/*/code` and `x:@.courses/1/*/title`
 *   retrieve the [code] and [title] of the **second course**, where `1` refers to the zero-based index.
 *
 * ## Summary
 * This demonstrates how to extract individual fields from the second record of a static collection
 * using numeric indexing and return the result using [yield].
