/*
 * This Hyperlambda file demonstrates how to perform a master-detail data retrieval pattern by using the [include] slot in combination with [data.read],
 * where a list of 'Professor' records is fetched from the 'university' database, and each professor record is enriched with their associated 'Course' records.
 *
 * [data.connect]
 * Connects to the 'university' database. This slot is mandatory before any data access operation via [data.read] can occur.
 *
 * [data.read]
 * Reads the first 50 records from the 'Professor' table.
 * The [columns] node specifies which columns to retrieve — only 'ProfessorId' and 'LastName' in this case — optimizing performance by omitting unneeded data.
 *
 * [include]
 * The [include] slot is used to dynamically join or embed related records from a secondary query into each of the primary records.
 * It iterates over the records returned by the parent [data.read] and injects additional data into each result.
 *
 * Inside [include]
 * Another [data.read] is executed to retrieve 'Course' records, filtered by matching 'ProfessorId' from the parent professor record (using expression evaluation).
 *
 * [columns] inside the nested [data.read]
 * Only the 'CourseId' and 'Title' columns from the 'Course' table are selected, again optimizing data retrieval.
 *
 * [where]
 * Filters 'Course' records to only include those taught by the current professor being processed by [include].
 * The value of 'ProfessorId.eq' is dynamically retrieved using an expression that resolves to the current professor's 'ProfessorId'.
 *
 * [yield]
 * The inner [yield] inside [include] ensures that the courses retrieved for each professor are attached under a 'courses' child node in the parent professor object.
