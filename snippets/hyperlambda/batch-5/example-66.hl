/*
 * Removes the [quantity] attribute from all items in the [.cart] list using [for-each].
 *
 * ## Slot Documentation
 *
 * - [.cart]
 *   Defines a simulated shopping cart with multiple items. Each item has:
 *   - [item]: The product name.
 *   - [quantity]: The number of units added to the cart.
 *   - [price]: The unit price.
 *   This data structure emulates an e-commerce checkout scenario.
 *
 * - [for-each]
 *   Iterates through every item node in the [.cart] using `x:@.cart/*`.
 *   The [.dp] reference points to the current item node in the iteration.
 *
 * - [remove-nodes]
 *   The [quantity] node is identified and removed by:
 *   - Accessing the current item node via `@.dp`.
 *   - Using `#` to reference the node.
 *   - Selecting all children with `*`.
 *   - Filtering to just the `quantity` field.
 *   This approach ensures only the [quantity] node is targeted for removal.
 *
 * ## Summary
 * The code effectively demonstrates how to filter out unnecessary or intermediate data,
 * such as item counts, when preparing order summaries or reports.
