/*
 * This Hyperlambda file enriches academic course data with live enrollment stats from an API
 * using [for-each], [http.get], and [add] for full manual control over data injection.
 *
 * [data.connect]
 * Opens a connection to the 'university' database.
 *
 * [data.read]
 * Reads 50 records from the 'Courses' table, selecting 'CourseId' and 'Title'.
 *
 * [for-each]
 * Iterates through each course and performs enrichment.
 *
 * - [http.get] sends a GET request to 'https://api.university.edu/enrollments'
 *   with the current course ID passed as the 'cid' query parameter.
 *
 * - [convert:true] allows the API's JSON response to be automatically parsed into a usable Hyperlambda structure.
 *
 * - The API response's 'content' children are unwrapped and added to the root.
 *
 * - These nodes are then grouped under a 'enrollment' container and added to the current course node.
 *
 * Final [yield]
 * The final list of enriched course records is returned under the 'enriched' node.
