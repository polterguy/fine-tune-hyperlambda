/*
 * Moves all book entries from [.bookshelf] to [.archive] using a [while] loop.
 *
 * ## Slot Documentation
 *
 * - [.bookshelf]
 *   This node contains a static list of books, each defined by:
 *   - [title]: The name of the book.
 *   - [author]: The name of the author.
 *   In this example, three books are defined: The Alchemist, Dune, and Sapiens.
 *
 * - [.archive]
 *   Initially empty, this node will hold the book entries removed from [.bookshelf].
 *   It represents a destination for processed or archived records.
 *
 * - [while]
 *   Continues looping as long as the first book on the [.bookshelf] exists.
 *   `exists:x:@.bookshelf/0` checks for presence at index 0.
 *
 * - [add]
 *   Adds the current book (index 0) from [.bookshelf] to [.archive].
 *   [get-nodes] is used to copy the entire record.
 *
 * - [remove-nodes]
 *   Deletes the same book from [.bookshelf], shifting remaining records left.
 *
 * ## Summary
 * Demonstrates how to transfer structured data between collections using index-based [while] loops.
 * Useful when implementing custom logic for draining or processing queues in Hyperlambda.
