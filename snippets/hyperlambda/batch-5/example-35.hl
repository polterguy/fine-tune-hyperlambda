/*
 * This Hyperlambda endpoint statically defines a list of available products and yields them to the client.
 *
 * ## Slot Documentation
 *
 * - [.arguments]
 *   Declares this file as an HTTP-invocable endpoint. No arguments are required for execution.
 *
 * - [.products]
 *   Holds a static collection of product objects. Each item includes:
 *   - [name]: The name of the product.
 *   - [price]: The unit price of the item.
 *   This list simulates a basic inventory snapshot and could be used for testing or documentation.
 *
 * - [yield]
 *   Outputs the list of product nodes directly to the caller. The lambda `x:@.products/*` selects all child items,
 *   resulting in a clean JSON array of product records.
 *
 * ## Summary
 * Useful as a template for static inventory APIs or mock product listings, this snippet demonstrates
 * how to return structured static data from a Hyperlambda endpoint using [yield].
