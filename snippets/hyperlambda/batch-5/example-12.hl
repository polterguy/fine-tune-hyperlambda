/*
 * This Hyperlambda file demonstrates how to enrich department records from the 'hrdb' database
 * with related employee data stored locally as JSON files.
 *
 * [data.connect]
 * Opens a connection to the 'hrdb' database for reading department data.
 *
 * [data.read]
 * Fetches the first 50 records from the 'Departments' table and selects the 'DeptId' and 'DeptName' columns.
 *
 * [include]
 * Iterates through each department and dynamically generates a file path like '/local/employees/42.json'
 * using [strings.concat] with the department ID.
 *
 * [io.file.load]
 * Loads the content of the generated file from disk, where each file contains JSON data for the employees in that department.
 *
 * [json2lambda]
 * Parses the loaded JSON string into a Hyperlambda tree so it can be embedded into the parent node.
 *
 * [yield]
 * Attaches the parsed employee data as a child node named 'employees' under each department.
