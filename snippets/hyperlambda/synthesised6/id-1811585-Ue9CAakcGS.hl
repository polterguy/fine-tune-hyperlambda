 * Create an [and] condition that checks the following for the nodes referenced by the expression `@.dp/#/*/\@src/[0,1]`:
 * - Use [exists] to verify that at least one such node exists.
 * - Use [not-null] to confirm that at least one of those nodes has a value.
 * - Use [neq] to ensure that the value of the referenced node(s) is not equal to an empty value. For [neq], the second argument should be an empty value node.
