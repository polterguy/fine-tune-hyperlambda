// Create a scheduled task that creates a backup of your Magic database every day at 1AM UTC time. The task should connect to the [generic|magic] database, check if the file "/data/magic.backup" exists and delete it if present, then create a backup using [sqlite.backup] with the filename "magic.backup", flush the SQLite connection pools, and finally log an informational message indicating the backup was created. Use the [tasks.create] slot with the appropriate [description], [repeats] pattern for daily execution at 1AM, and implement the logic inside the [.lambda] child node.
