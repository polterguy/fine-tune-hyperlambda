// Create a conditional block using [if] that checks if the node [.crawl-delay] is not null. If this condition is true, execute the following lambda: first, use [unwrap] with the expression `:+/*/*` to evaluate and process all grandchildren of the next sibling node; then use [add] to add a child node named [crawl-delay] (with its value set to the value of [.crawl-delay]) into the [return] node that is a child of the [try] node.
