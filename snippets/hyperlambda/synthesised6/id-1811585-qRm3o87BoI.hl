// Create a logical expression that evaluates to true only if a referenced [@href] attribute does NOT start with "http://" and does NOT start with "https://". Use [not] with [strings.starts-with] for both conditions, and combine them using [and]. The expression should check the first [@href] attribute among a set of nodes, by using the expression `@.dp/#/./*/\@href/[0,1]` as the string to test.
