// Create an [else] block that constructs a Markdown image snippet. Inside this block, use [strings.concat] to concatenate the following elements in order: a literal "![", the first value found from the node set specified by the expression `@.dp/#/*/\@alt/[0,1]` (falling back to the static string "Image " if none is found), a literal "](", the value from the [@.url] node, and a closing literal ")". Then, use [unwrap:x:+/*/*] to evaluate any expressions within the concatenated string, and finally use [add:x:@.snippets/0/-] to append a new node containing a [completion] child node with the resulting Markdown image string as its value.
