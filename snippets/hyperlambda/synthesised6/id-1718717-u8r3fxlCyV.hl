// Combine multiple logical checks using [and] to ensure that the node(s) selected by the expression `@.dp/#/*/\@href/[0,1]` both exist and are not null, are not equal to null or empty, and do not start with "http://" or "https://". Use [exists], [not-null], [neq], and [not] with [strings.starts-with] to build this complex verification.
