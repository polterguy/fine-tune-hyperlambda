// Create an [if] conditional that checks if the value of [http.get] is not greater than or equal to 200 and also not less than 300 (i.e., the status code is not in the 200â€“299 range). If this condition is true, log an error with the URL (from [.dp/#]) and the status code (from [http.get]), then throw an exception with the message "Could not retrieve sitemap".
