// Write Hyperlambda code that performs a [data.read] query against a SQLite database, joining the [Employees] table to itself using a left join. The join should be on the condition that [Employees.ReportsTo] equals [ReportsTo.EmployeeID], and the joined table should be aliased as [ReportsTo]. In the query, select a column named [aggregate_functor] and alias it as [result], add an empty [where]/[and] clause, and group the results by [group_column]. The database type should be set to [sqlite].
