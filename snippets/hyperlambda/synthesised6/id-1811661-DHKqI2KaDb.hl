// Create a Hyperlambda snippet that sends a POST request to the OpenAI Chat Completions endpoint using [http.post]. Pass the authorization token and Content-Type as HTTP headers using a [headers] node, and construct a JSON [payload] node specifying the model (from [.model]), max_tokens (from [.max-size]), temperature (set to 0.3), and a [messages] array with a system prompt and a user message. The user's message content should be populated from the value of the [completion] node inside the currently iterated [.dp] node. Ensure that the response is automatically converted to its correct type by setting [convert] to true.
