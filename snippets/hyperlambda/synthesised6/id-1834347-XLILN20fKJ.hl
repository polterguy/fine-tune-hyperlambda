// Use the [insert-after] slot to add two new nodes named [consumes] and [produces] immediately after all [operationId] nodes that are descendants four levels below the [.buffer] node. The [consumes] node will have its value set dynamically to the value of the [consumes] node from the same sub-tree as the current [operationId], by referencing `:x:@.dp/#/*/consumes`. The [produces] node will have its value set statically to "application/json".
