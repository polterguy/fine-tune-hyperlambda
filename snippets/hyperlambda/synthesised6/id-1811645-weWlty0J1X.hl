// Create a conditional that returns true only if all of the following conditions are satisfied: the expression `@.scan/0` yields at least one node, the node(s) at `@.scan/0/*/cached` are not null, and after converting the value of the node(s) at `@.scan/0/*/cached` to an integer, that value is more than 0. Use the [and] slot, and combine [exists], [not-null], and [mt] with [convert] as needed.
