// Demonstrate how to create a new PostgreSQL database named "magic" and then connect to it, executing the SQL statement loaded from a file. First, use the [pgsql.connect] slot with the connection string for the "postgres" database to execute a "create database magic" SQL command. Then, connect to the newly created "magic" database using [pgsql.connect], and execute another SQL statement using [pgsql.execute], where the statement is dynamically loaded from a file using [io.file.load].
case:pgsql
   pgsql.connect:[generic|postgres]
      pgsql.execute:create database magic
   pgsql.connect:[generic|magic]
      pgsql.execute:x:@io.file.load
