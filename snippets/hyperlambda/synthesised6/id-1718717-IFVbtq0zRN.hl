// Add an [else-if] block that checks if either [.semantics] does not exist or its value is true, and also verifies that a [main] node exists somewhere within [body] inside the [html2lambda] node. If both conditions are met, execute the lambda that adds all children nodes of [main] (found inside [body] of [html2lambda]) to the [.content] node. Use [and], [or], and [not] to construct the conditional logic, and retrieve the relevant nodes with [get-nodes].
