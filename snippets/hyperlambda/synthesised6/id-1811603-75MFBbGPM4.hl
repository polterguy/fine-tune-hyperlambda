// Create a conditional workflow that checks if [.auto_destruct] is true. If so, send an informational message to the feedback channel indicating a scheduled task will delete the chatbot in 7 days. Wait briefly, then calculate the date 7 days from now by adding 7 days to the current date. Create a task name by concatenating "delete-chatbot-" with the value of [.type]. Unwrap and assign values for [.task] and [.type] from their respective nodes. Use [tasks.create] to define a new task with the generated name and description, and schedule it to run at the computed date. Inside the task's lambda, perform the following actions: store [.type], connect to the database and delete relevant rows from [ml_training_snippets] where type matches, store [.task], connect again to delete entries from [ml_types] where type matches, build a file path by concatenating "/etc/www/", [.type], and ".html", delete the corresponding file, log that the demo chatbot was deleted including the type, and finally delete the scheduled task itself using [tasks.delete].
