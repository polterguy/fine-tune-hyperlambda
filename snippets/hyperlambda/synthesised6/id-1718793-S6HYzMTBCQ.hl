// Add an [else-if] conditional block that checks if the result of [http.post] is greater than or equal to 200 and less than 300. If this condition is true, inside its [.lambda] section: signal to the feedback channel specified in [.arguments/*/feedback-channel] with a message "Successfully created summary of snippet" and type "info" using [sockets.signal], then wait for 100 milliseconds with [sleep]. Next, set the value of the [completion] node (found by dereferencing [.dp/#/*/completion]) to the trimmed content from [http.post/*/content/*/choices/0/*/message/*/content], removing all whitespace and newlines. Then, set the value of the [prompt] node (found by dereferencing [.dp/#/*/prompt]) to a string that starts with "Summary; " followed by the first 150 characters from the original prompt. Finally, set the value of the [.no] node to 0.
