// Update the value of the [.url] node by concatenating the value of the [.base] node, a "/" character, and the value of the first [@href] attribute found among the children of the node referenced by [.dp] (using the expression `@.dp/#/./*/\@href/[0,1]`). Use [strings.concat] for the concatenation, and [get-value] to fetch the relevant node values.
