// Create an [if] condition that checks if the value of the [.vectorize] node is equal to boolean true. If the condition is true, execute a [.lambda] that first unwraps all the next sibling nodes of the current node, and then signals the [magic.ai.vectorise] slot, passing in the value of the [.type] node as [type], and the value of the [.feedback-channel] node as [feedback-channel].
