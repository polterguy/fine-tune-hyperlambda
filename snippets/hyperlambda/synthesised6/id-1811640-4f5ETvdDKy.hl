// Continue an if/else-if conditional block by adding an [else-if] node that checks two conditions using [and]: that the value of the [.result] node contains the string "FUNCTION_INVOCATION[", and that the value of [.has-sent-waiting] is not true. If both conditions are met, execute a lambda object that sends a "function_waiting" signal to the session specified by [.session] using [sockets.signal], and then set the value of [.has-sent-waiting] to true.
