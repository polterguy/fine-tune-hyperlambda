// Create a [switch] statement that examines the result of the [get-name] slot, and for each [case] node, perform different actions. For the [case] named "li", use an [if] statement to check if the [.completion] node is not empty, and if so, prepend a newline and a "- " string to its value using [strings.concat], then update [.completion] with the result. For the [case] named "p", prepend two newlines to the value of [.completion] using [strings.concat] and update [.completion] accordingly.
