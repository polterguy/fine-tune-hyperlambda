// Iterate through each child node of [data.read] using [for-each]. For each node, construct a new [prompt] node by concatenating the referenced [prompt] child value with " ->", and a [completion] node by concatenating the referenced [completion] child value with " END". Then, unwrap all immediate descendant nodes, and add a new snippet to the [snippets] node, containing the generated [prompt] and [completion] as children.
