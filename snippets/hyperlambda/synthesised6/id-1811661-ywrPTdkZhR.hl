// Create a conditional branching structure that uses [and] to check if the value of the [type] node inside of the [.arguments] node is equal to something, and also if either the value of the [completion] node inside of the currently iterated node (referenced by [.dp]) is equal to something, or if the value of the [completion] node inside of the currently iterated node is like the value returned by [strings.concat]. Use [type.eq] and [completion.eq] and [completion.like] for the comparisons, nesting an [or] inside the [and].
