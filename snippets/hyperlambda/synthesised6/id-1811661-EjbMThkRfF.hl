// Create a conditional block that checks if the number of child nodes named [snippets] inside the children of [signal] is more than 0. If true, concatenate a string reporting how many training snippets were found, unwrap the resulting message, send it as an info-type message through the feedback channel specified in [.arguments] under [feedback-channel], and then sleep for 100 milliseconds.
