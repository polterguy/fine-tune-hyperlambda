// Create an [if] statement that checks two conditions using [and]: First, that the value of the node referenced by [.dp/#] is not null ([not-null]), and second, that the value of [.dp/#] is not equal to an empty string ([neq]). If both conditions are true, use a [.lambda] block to set the value of the [.prompt] node to the result of concatenating the value of [.dp/#], the string " - ", and the current value of [.prompt], using [strings.concat].
