// Iterate through all [\#cdata-section] nodes found inside the [loc] elements of an XML structure located at [xml2lambda], and for each node, if the count of children of [.urls] is less than 10,000, create a [.url] node and set its value to the content of the current node. If the value does not start with "http://" or "https://", prepend the value of [.domain] to it. Then, if the computed [.url] does not already exist as a child of [.urls], unwrap the next siblingâ€™s children and add the [.url] value as a new child under [.urls].
