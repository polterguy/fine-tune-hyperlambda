// Create a conditional expression using [not] that checks if [http.post] does NOT have a status code greater than or equal to 200 AND less than 300. This will evaluate to true if the status code is NOT in the 2xx range. Use [mte] to check if [http.post] is greater than or equal to 200, and [lt] to check if it is less than 300, both inside an [and] condition, and wrap the entire condition in [not].
