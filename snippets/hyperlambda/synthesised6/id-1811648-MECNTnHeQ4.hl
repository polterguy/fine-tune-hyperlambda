// Add the result of a [data.select] SQL query to the [.data] node. The query selects the [id], [prompt], and [completion] columns from the [ml_training_snippets] table where the [type] matches the value from [.arguments] node's [type] child, and [id] is greater than the value from the [.id] node. It also ensures that [embedding] is null, orders by [id], and limits the result to 20 records. The [type] and [id] parameters for the SQL query are set dynamically from their respective nodes.
add:x:@.data
   data.select:"\nselect id, prompt, completion\n   from ml_training_snippets\n   where type = @type and id > @id and embedding is null order by id limit 20"
      type:x:@.arguments/*/type
      id:x:@.id
