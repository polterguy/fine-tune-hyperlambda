// Create a conditional statement that checks for each node referenced by [.dp] if the node has a child [uri] (using [not-null:x:@.dp/#/*/uri]) and if there does not already exist a node with the same [uri] value anywhere under [.result] (using [not-exists:x:"@.result/*/*/uri/\"={@.dp/#/*/uri}\""]). If both conditions are true, unwrap all grandchildren of siblings of the current node, then add a new node to [.result] containing [prompt], [uri], and [distance], copying their values from the corresponding children of the currently iterated node under [.dp].
