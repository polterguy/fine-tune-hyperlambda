// Write Hyperlambda code that connects to the [magic] database using [data.connect], then performs a [data.select] query to retrieve the [id], [prompt], and [completion] columns from the [ml_training_snippets] table where the [type] column matches the value in [.arguments] node's [type], the [id] is greater than the value in the [.id] node, and the [embedding] column is null. Order the results by [id] and limit to 20 records. Add the result to the [.data] node. Use parameterized arguments for [type] and [id].
