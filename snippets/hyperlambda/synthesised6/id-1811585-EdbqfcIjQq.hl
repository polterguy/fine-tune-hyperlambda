// Create an [else-if] conditional that checks if the value referenced by the expression `@.dp/#/./*/\@href/[0,1]` does NOT start with "http://" and does NOT start with "https://". If both conditions are true, execute the associated [.lambda] block, which sets the value of the [.url] node by concatenating the value of [.base], a "/" character, and the value referenced by `@.dp/#/./*/\@href/[0,1]`.
