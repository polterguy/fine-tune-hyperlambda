// Create a conditional block that evaluates to true only if the value of the [type] node inside [.arguments] is equal to something, and either the [completion] node inside the currently iterated node is equal to something, or the result of [strings.concat] matches the [completion.like] comparison. Use [and] as the main logical condition with [type.eq] as the first argument, and [or] as the second argument, nesting the appropriate comparisons inside of [or].
