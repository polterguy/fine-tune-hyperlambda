// Add an [else-if] conditional block that checks if the value of [@http.post] is greater than or equal to 200 and less than 300. If this condition is true, execute the following actions within its [.lambda] child: send a socket signal to the feedback channel specified in [@.arguments/*/feedback-channel] with a message indicating successful creation of the summary; wait for 100 milliseconds using [sleep]; set the value of the [completion] child node of [@.dp/#/*] to the trimmed content of the summary response from [@http.post/*/content/*/choices/0/*/message/*/content]; update the [prompt] child node of [@.dp/#/*] to a concatenated string starting with "Summary; " and followed by the first 150 characters of its previous value; finally, set the value of [.no] to 0.
