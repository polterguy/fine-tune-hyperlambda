/*
 * Create a logical [and] block that combines the following conditions, all applied to the result of the expression `@.dp/#/*/\@href/[0,1]`:
 * 
 * - The [exists] slot should return true if the expression yields at least one node.
 * - The [not-null] slot should return true if at least one node from the expression has a non-null value.
 * - The [neq] slot should return true if the value of the node from the expression is not equal to the value of its own value (using `.#`).
 * - The [neq] slot should return true if the value of the node from the expression is not equal to an empty value (using `.:`). 
 * 
 * Wrap all these conditions in an [and] block so that the entire block evaluates to true only if all individual conditions are satisfied.
