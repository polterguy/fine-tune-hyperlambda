// Demonstrate how to check that at least one [.api_key] node exists under all children of all children of [data.read], and that not all of these [.api_key] nodes are empty. Use [and] to combine the two conditions: the first uses [not-null] with the expression `x:@data.read/*/*/api_key` to ensure at least one [.api_key] exists with a value, and the second uses [neq] with the same expression as the left argument and an empty value as the right argument, to confirm that the value is not empty.
