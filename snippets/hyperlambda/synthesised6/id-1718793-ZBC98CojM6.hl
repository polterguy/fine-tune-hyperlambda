// Create a conditional block that checks if the value of [.failed] is more than 0. If true, concatenate the value of [.failed] with the string " snippets failed during import, probably because of OpenAI not being able to summarize them", then unwrap the next sibling node and signal a socket message to the feedback channel specified in [.arguments/*/feedback-channel], passing arguments where [message] is the concatenated string and [type] is "warning". Finally, sleep for 100 milliseconds.
