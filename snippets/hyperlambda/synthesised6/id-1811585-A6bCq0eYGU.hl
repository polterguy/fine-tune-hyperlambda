// Create an [else] block that constructs a Markdown image link snippet. Start by using [strings.concat] to assemble the string in the following order: the literal "![", the result of [get-first-value] that tries to retrieve the value of the first [@alt] node (using the expression `@.dp/#/*/\@alt/[0,1]`), the literal "Image " if no [@alt] exists, the literal "](", the value of the [@.url] node, and the literal ")". Unwrap the concatenated result, then add it as a [completion] node to the first snippet's previous sibling under the [.snippets] node.
