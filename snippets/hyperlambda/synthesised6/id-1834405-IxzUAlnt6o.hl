// If the [can-timeshift] capability exists as a child of the [log.capabilities] node, add a [lambda2hyper] node as a child of [.lambda], containing a [timeshifts] hierarchy with nodes for [logins], [access_denied], [openai_success], [openai_failure], and [lead_generated]. Each of these should include descriptive [name] and [description] nodes, and an [items] node. Then, for each [items] node in the respective [timeshifts] category, add a [log.timeshift] entry describing the corresponding event (such as user authenticated, access denied, OpenAI success/failure, or lead generated).
