// Execute two delete SQL statements using [data.execute]. The first statement deletes from the [vss_ml_training_snippets] table where the [rowid] matches any [id] from the [ml_training_snippets] table, filtered by [type] and [uri]. The second statement deletes directly from [ml_training_snippets] with the same [type] and [uri] filter. Supply the [type] parameter from [.arguments/*/type] and the [uri] parameter from [.uri].
