// Concatenate the value of the first [completion] node found under the first snippet, followed by a line break in Markdown code block format, then the trimmed value of the first text node under [.dp] (removing spaces, tabs, and newlines), and finally end with a closing Markdown code block. Use [strings.concat] for the concatenation, [get-value] to extract values, and [strings.trim] to clean up the text node.
