// Create a condition that returns true only if the value of the [max_requests] node inside [.model] is not equal to -1, and the value of the [no_requests] node inside [.model] is more than or equal to the value of [max_requests]. Use [and] to require that both conditions are true, [neq] to check if [max_requests] is not -1, and [mte] to compare [no_requests] and [max_requests].
