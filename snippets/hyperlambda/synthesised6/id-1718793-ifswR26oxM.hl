// Create a conditional check to determine if the number of child nodes named [snippets] under each child of the [signal] node is greater than 0. If this condition is true, concatenate a string that reports how many training snippets were found on the page by combining the static text "Found ", the count of snippets, and the static text " training snippets on page". Unwrap the result of this concatenation and send it as an info-type message to the feedback channel specified in [.arguments] > [feedback-channel] using the [sockets.signal] slot, then pause execution for 100 milliseconds.
