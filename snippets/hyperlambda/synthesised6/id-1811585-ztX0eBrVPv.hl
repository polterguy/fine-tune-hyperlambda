// Create an [else] block that constructs a Markdown code block by concatenating three parts: a literal "```" (backtick code fence) string followed by a line break, the result of trimming whitespace from the first [#text] descendant of the current data pointer node, and another literal closing "```" code fence. Then, use [unwrap] on the two next sibling nodes' children to evaluate any expressions, and [add] the result as a new [.completion] node to the previous sibling of [0] in [.snippets].
