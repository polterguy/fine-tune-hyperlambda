// Add an [else-if] conditional that checks if the value found at the expression `@.dp/#/./*/\@href/[0,1]` does NOT start with "http://" AND does NOT start with "https://". If both conditions are true, execute the lambda object, which sets the value of the [.url] node to the concatenation of the value at [.base], a "/" character, and the value found at the same [@href] expression. Use [strings.starts-with], [not], [and], [set-value], and [strings.concat] as shown.
