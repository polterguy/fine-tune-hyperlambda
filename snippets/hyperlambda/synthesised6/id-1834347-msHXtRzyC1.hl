// Create a conditional block using [if] that checks whether the currently iterated node referenced by [.dp] contains a child node named [description]. If such a node exists, use [unwrap] to evaluate the next sibling's children, and then use [insert-after] to insert a new node with the name [description] and its value set to the [description] child node of [.dp], placing it after the [name] node inside [.arg].
