// Create a [try] block that attempts to set the value of the [.crawl-delay] node by multiplying 1000 with the integer conversion of the value from [.value]. After calculating [.crawl-delay], use an [if] statement to check if [.crawl-delay] is more than 60000. If it is, send a signal on the feedback channel specified in [.arguments/*/feedback-channel] with a warning message stating "Crawl-Delay was more than 60 seconds, using 60 seconds as our value", and then set [.crawl-delay] to 60000.
