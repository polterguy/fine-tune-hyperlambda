// Iterate through all descendant nodes named "#text" (using the escaped iterator) from the node referenced by [.dp], and for each, set the value of [.anchor] to a concatenation of its current value, a space, and the value of the currently iterated "#text" node. Use [for-each] to perform this operation.
