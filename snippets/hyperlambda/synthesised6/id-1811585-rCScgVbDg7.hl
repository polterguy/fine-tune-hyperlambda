// Create an [if] statement that checks two conditions using [and]: First, that the value of the node referenced by [.dp/#] is not null ([not-null]), and second, that this value is not equal to an empty value ([neq]). If both conditions are true, assign the concatenation of the value of [.dp/#], the string " - ", and the current value of [.prompt] to the [.prompt] node using [set-value] and [strings.concat].
