// Check if the value of the [.crawl-delay] node is more than 60,000 (interpreted as 60 seconds). If it is, send a warning message using [sockets.signal] to the feedback channel specified in [.arguments/*/feedback-channel], informing that the crawl delay was more than 60 seconds and that 60 seconds will be used instead. Then, set the value of [.crawl-delay] to 60,000.
