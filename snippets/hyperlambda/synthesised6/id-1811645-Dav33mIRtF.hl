// Create a conditional block using [if] that checks if all of the following are true: the node [@.scan/0] exists, its child node [cached] is not null, and the value of [cached] (converted to integer) is more than 0. If these conditions are met, execute a lambda that first unwraps the next siblings’ children, then sets the value of [@.scan/0/*/completion] by calling [strings.mixin] on its current value and passing in a [prompt] argument from [.arguments/*/prompt]. Afterwards, unwrap the next sibling’s children again, and return a result containing [cached] set to the value of [@.scan/0/*/completion] and [db_time] set to [@.time].
