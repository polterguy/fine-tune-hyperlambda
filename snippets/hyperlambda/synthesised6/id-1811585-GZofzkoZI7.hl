// Check if there is a [base] element inside the [head] node of the [html2lambda] node, and if it exists, set the value of the [.base] node to the [href] attribute of the first [base] element in [html2lambda/*/head/*/base], after trimming any trailing "/" from its value. Use [exists] to check for the element, [set-value] to assign the value, and [strings.trim-end] to remove the trailing slash.
