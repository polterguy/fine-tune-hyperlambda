/*
 * Change the value of all [operationId] nodes that are descendants three levels below the [.buffer] node. The new value for each [operationId] node should be set to the concatenation of:
 * 
 * 1. The value of the [verb] node that is a child of the currently iterated node's parent.
 * 2. An underscore ("_").
 * 3. The value of the first node in the result of a [strings.split] operation, two levels up from the current node (using `-/-`).
 * 4. Another underscore ("_").
 * 5. The value of the first node in the result of a [strings.split] operation, one level up from the current node (using `-`).
 * 
 * Use [strings.concat] to join all these string segments together and assign the result as the new value for each [operationId] node.
