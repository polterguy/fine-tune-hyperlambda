// Create a condition that evaluates to true only if all of the following are true: the [.arguments] node has at least one [supervised] child ([exists:x:@.arguments/*/supervised]), at least one of those [supervised] nodes is not null ([not-null:x:@.arguments/*/supervised]), and the value of [supervised] (converted to integer) is exactly 1 ([eq] with [convert:x:@.arguments/*/supervised] and a static int:1 value). Use [and] to combine these checks.
