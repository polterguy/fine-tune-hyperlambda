// Concatenate several string fragments and set the result as the value of the [.completion] node. The concatenation should include the current value of [.completion], a space, an opening square bracket, the result of trimming whitespace and special characters from the value produced by [strings.replace] (with the specified string to trim), an opening parenthesis, the value of [.url], a closing parenthesis, and another space. Use [strings.concat] to join all these parts together.
