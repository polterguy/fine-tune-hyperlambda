// Show an example of how to use the [else] slot to execute a code block if all preceding [if] and [else-if] conditions fail. Inside the [else] block, first use [unwrap] with the expression `x:+/*/*` to forward-evaluate expressions for the next node, then use [add] to insert a child node with empty string content to the previous sibling of the first child under [snippets].
