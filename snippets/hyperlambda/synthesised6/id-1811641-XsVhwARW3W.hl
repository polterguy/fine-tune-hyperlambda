// Create an [and] condition that checks two things: First, that there exists at least one grandchild node under [data.read] (i.e., [exists:x:@data.read/*/*]); and second, that at least one of these grandchildren has a [cached] child whose value (after converting to integer) is exactly 1. Use [convert] to ensure type safety, and [eq] to compare the value.
