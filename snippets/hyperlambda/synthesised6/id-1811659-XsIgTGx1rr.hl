// Create a condition that only evaluates to true if the value of the [has-sitemap] node (child of [signal]) is false, and the number of child nodes under [.urls] is exactly 0. Use the [and] slot with two [eq] comparisons: the first checks that [has-sitemap] is `bool:false`, and the second checks that [get-count] of [.urls/*] equals `int:0`.
