// Create a Hyperlambda script that sends a POST request to "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" using [http.post]. Use headers for Authorization (with a token from [@.token]) and Content-Type as "application/json". The payload should include a model (from [@.model]), max_tokens (from [@.max-size]), temperature set to 0.3, and a messages array consisting of two objects: the first with role "system" and content "Create a summary of the following information", and the second with role "user" and content from [@.dp/#/*/completion]. Set [convert] to true to automatically convert the response.
