// Iterate through all [urls] child nodes under each child node of [signal], and for each node, evaluate all its next sibling nodes and their descendants, then signal the method specified by the value of the [feedback-channel] node inside [.arguments], passing in an [args] node containing a [message] node with the value of the currently iterated node, and a [type] node with the value "info". After signaling, pause execution for 10 milliseconds before continuing.
