/*
 * Iterate over each child node of the [signal] node, and for each one, send a POST request to the OpenAI Chat Completions API using [http.post]. Set the request headers to include an Authorization header with a token from [.token], specify the Content-Type as application/json, and set Accept to text/event-stream. For the request payload, use the gpt-3.5-turbo model with a max_tokens of 1000 and temperature 0.3. Construct the [messages] array so that the first message is a system message with its content taken from the [massagePrompt] argument, and the second message is a user message with its content taken from the current signal's [completion] child node.
 * 
 * After the [http.post] call, check if the HTTP status code is not between 200 and 299. If so, convert the response to Hyperlambda using [lambda2hyper], and log an error with the error message, status, and converted error details. Otherwise, retrieve the assistant's reply from the response (specifically from [choices/0/message/content]) and set it as the value of the current signal's [prompt] child node.
