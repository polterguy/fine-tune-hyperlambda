// Create an [and] block that combines the following logical checks: [exists] ensures that [.arguments] has a child node named [references], [not-null] confirms that this [references] node has a non-null value, [get-value] retrieves the value of the [references] node (acting as an additional truthy check), and [exists] checks that the [signal] node has a child node named [snippets].

   not-null:x:@.arguments/*/references
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/references
   exists:x:@signal/*/snippets
