// Write a condition that returns true only if both of the following are true: (1) the currently iterated value from [.dp/#] does not exist as a child of [.done] nor as a child of [.urls], and (2) the value of [.dp/#] starts with the value of the [url] argument inside [.arguments]. Use [and] as the parent node, and use [not-exists] for both checks against [.done] and [.urls], and [strings.starts-with] for the prefix check.
