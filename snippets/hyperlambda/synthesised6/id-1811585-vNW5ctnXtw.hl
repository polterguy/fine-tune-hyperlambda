// Iterate through all child nodes of [.snippets] using [for-each]. For each iterated node, check if both a [prompt] and [completion] child node exist, are not null, and the [prompt] node has a length greater than 0. If these conditions are met, trim the values of both the [prompt] and [completion] nodes using [strings.trim], then add the entire snippet node to the [return] collection at the parent level.
