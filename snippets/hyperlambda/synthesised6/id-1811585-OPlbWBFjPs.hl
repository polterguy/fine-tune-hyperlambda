// Check if there is a [completion] node under the first snippet, and if it exists, set its value to the result of concatenating its current value, a code block opening (triple backticks), the trimmed text content from the first [#text] descendant node of the current [.dp] node (removing spaces and tabs), and a code block closing (triple backticks). Use [strings.concat] with [get-value] and [strings.trim] to construct the new value, and [set-value] to update the [completion] node.
