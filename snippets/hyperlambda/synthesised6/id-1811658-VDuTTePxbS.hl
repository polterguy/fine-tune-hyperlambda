// Concatenate the value of the first and second nodes from the [strings.split] node, separated by "://", and assign the resulting string as the value of the [.domain] node. Use [set-value] with an expression referencing [.domain], and build the string with [strings.concat], retrieving the two split values with [get-value] using expressions pointing to [strings.split/0] and [strings.split/1].
