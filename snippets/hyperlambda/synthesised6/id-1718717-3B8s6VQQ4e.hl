// Write Hyperlambda code that checks if the currently iterated node (referenced by [.dp]) has non-null [prompt] and [completion] child nodes, where the [prompt] node's string length is greater than 0. If all these conditions are true, trim whitespace from both the [prompt] and [completion] nodes' values, then add the entire node (referenced by [.dp]) to its parent node's [return] collection.
