// Divide the result of subtracting 2 from the value of [max_tokens] (found inside the [.model] node) by an unspecified second value. First, use [math.subtract] to subtract 2 from the value retrieved from [.model/*/max_tokens], then use [math.divide] to divide that result. The expression assumes you want to perform further division, possibly with another argument as a child of [math.divide].
