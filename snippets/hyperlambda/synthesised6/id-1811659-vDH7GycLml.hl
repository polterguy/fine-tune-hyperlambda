/*
 * Iterate through each child node of [allow] inside of [.arguments], and for each, evaluate the following steps: 
 * 1. Use [unwrap] with the `+/*` expression to get all next siblings of the current node.
 * 2. Invoke the [.match] lambda, passing in the value of the first [sort] node as [url], and the current iterated node as [pattern].
 * 3. Use [if] to check if the value returned from the previous [invoke] is true, and if so, set the value of the [.allowed] node to boolean true.
