 * Create an [and] condition that checks several things about the first node named "@href" (using escaped backslash) under the current [.dp] node by reference:
 * - Use [exists] to ensure this "@href" node exists.
 * - Use [not-null] to verify the node has a non-null value.
 * - Use [neq] twice: first, to ensure the value is not equal to its own value as a node reference; second, to ensure the value is not an empty value.
 * - Use [not] with [strings.starts-with] twice to make sure the value does not start with "http://" or "https://".
