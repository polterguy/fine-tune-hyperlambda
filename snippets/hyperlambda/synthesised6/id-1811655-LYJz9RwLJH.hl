// Iterate through each child node of the [signal] node using [for-each]. For every node, check if the value does not exist among the children of both the [done] and [urls] nodes, and also if the value starts with the value from [.arguments/*/url]. If all these conditions are true, add the current node (by reference) to the [urls] node.
