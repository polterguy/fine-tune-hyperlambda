Add the following HTTP headers: [Authorization] using the value from [@.token], [Content-Type] as "application/json", and [Accept] as "text/event-stream". The [payload] should include a [model] node with value "gpt-3.5-turbo", [max_tokens] as integer 1000, [temperature] as decimal 0.3, and [messages] with two message nodes: one where [role] is "system" and [content] is set from [@.arguments/*/massagePrompt], and one where [role] is "user" and [content] is set from [@.dp/#/*/completion].
