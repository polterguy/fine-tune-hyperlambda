// Create a Hyperlambda expression that sends a POST request to "https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings" using the [http.post] slot. The request should include custom HTTP headers, where the "Authorization" header's value is retrieved from the [.token] node and the "Content-Type" is set to "application/json". The request payload should be a JSON object with properties "model" and "input", with their values coming from [.vector-model] and [.embedding] respectively. Add a [convert] argument set to true to automatically convert the response to the appropriate type.
