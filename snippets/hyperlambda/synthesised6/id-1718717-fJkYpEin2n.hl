// Create a conditional that evaluates to true if any of the following are true: the [http.get] node does not have a [content] child, the [content] child of [http.get] is null, the value of the [content] child is an empty string, the [http.get] node does not have a [headers] -> [Content-Type] child, or the [Content-Type] header does not start with "text/html". Use the [or] slot to combine these conditions, and use [not-exists], [null], [eq], and [not] with [strings.starts-with] where appropriate, referencing the correct child nodes of [http.get] in each expression.
