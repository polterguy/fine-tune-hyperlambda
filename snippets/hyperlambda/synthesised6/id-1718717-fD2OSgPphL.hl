// Create an [else] block that concatenates a multiline string using [strings.concat], where the first part is a code block delimiter (```\n), the second part is the result of trimming the first [#text] descendant node of the value of [.dp] using [strings.trim] (with whitespace and tab characters as trim characters), and the third part is another code block delimiter. Then, unwrap the result of the next node's children and add this as a child to the previous sibling of the first snippet inside [.snippets], placing it under a node named [completion] that references the value from [strings.concat].
