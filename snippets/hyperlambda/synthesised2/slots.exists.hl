/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet checks for the existence of two dynamic slots named "foo" and "bar".
 * It uses the [slots.exists] slot to determine if these slots have been previously created.
 *
 * 1. [slots.create:foo]
 *    * Creates a dynamic slot named "foo" that returns a static integer value of 42 when invoked.
 *
 * 2. [slots.exists:foo]
 *    * Checks if the dynamic slot "foo" exists and returns a boolean value indicating its existence.
 *
 * 3. [slots.exists:bar]
 *    * Checks if the dynamic slot "bar" exists and returns a boolean value indicating its existence.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The first [slots.exists] invocation will return true because the "foo" slot exists.
 * * The second [slots.exists] invocation will return false because the "bar" slot has not been created.
