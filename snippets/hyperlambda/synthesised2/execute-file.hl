/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to execute an external Hyperlambda file and pass arguments to it.
 *
 * 1. [execute-file]
 *    * Executes the specified Hyperlambda file located at the given path.
 *    * Automatically unwraps all children nodes and transforms expressions to their static value equivalents.
 *
 * 2. [.args]
 *    * A data node that holds the arguments to be passed to the external Hyperlambda file.
 *
 * 3. [arg1] and [arg2]
 *    * These nodes are used as placeholder values to pass evaluated argument values to the external file.
 *
 * The external Hyperlambda file at "/path/to/external-file.hl" will be executed with the evaluated arguments
 * "value1" and "value2" for [arg1] and [arg2], respectively. Additionally, it will have a reference to the
 * entire [.args] node, allowing it to access or modify the data within.
