/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [html2lambda] slot to convert an HTML string into a lambda object.
 * The lambda object represents the structure of the HTML content, where HTML tags are converted into nodes, and attributes are
 * prefixed with an '@' character. Text content within HTML elements is represented by '#text' nodes.
 *
 * 1. [.html] - A data node containing the HTML string to be converted.
 * 2. [html2lambda] - The slot that takes the HTML string from the [.html] node and converts it into a structured lambda object.
 *
 * The resulting lambda object can be used for further processing, manipulation, or analysis within the Hyperlambda environment.
