/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to use the [mssql.read] slot to query data from a Microsoft SQL Server database.
 * It retrieves a list of employees from the "employees" table, specifically selecting their "id", "first_name", and "last_name" columns.
 * The results are ordered by the "id" column in ascending order and limited to the first 10 records.
 *
 * 1. [mssql.read]
 *    * Generates a SQL query to read records from a specified table in a Microsoft SQL Server database.
 *    * Requires a table name and can be customized with various arguments such as columns to select, ordering, and limits.
 *
 * 2. [table]
 *    * Specifies the name of the table to query, which in this example is "employees".
 *
 * 3. [columns]
 *    * Defines the specific columns to be selected from the table.
 *    * In this example, "id", "first_name", and "last_name" are the chosen columns.
 *
 * 4. [order]
 *    * Determines the column by which the results should be ordered.
 *    * Here, the results are ordered by the "id" column.
 *
 * 5. [direction]
 *    * Sets the direction of the ordering, either ascending (asc) or descending (desc).
 *    * This example uses ascending order.
 *
 * 6. [limit]
 *    * Limits the number of records returned by the query.
 *    * The example sets this limit to 10, meaning only the first 10 matching records will be returned.
 *
 * The resulting SQL query constructed by this Hyperlambda would be similar to:
 * "SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM employees ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 10".
