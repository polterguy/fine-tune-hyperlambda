/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [math.divide] slot to perform division operations.
 * It calculates the result of dividing a dynamic value retrieved from a node by a static integer value.
 *
 * 1. [.dividend]
 *    * A node holding the dividend as an integer value.
 *
 * 2. [math.divide]
 *    * Performs division of the values provided as its children.
 *    * The first child is a dynamic value retrieved using [get-value].
 *    * The second child is a static integer value.
 *
 * 3. [get-value]
 *    * Retrieves the value of the [.dividend] node to be used as the first operand in the division.
 *
 * 4. [.divisor]
 *    * A static integer value serving as the divisor.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The result of the division operation is stored as the value of the [math.divide] node.
 * * If the [.dividend] node has a value of 20, the result will be 20 / 4 = 5.
