/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to associate a file extension with a MIME type using the [mime.add] slot.
 * The association is created so that when files with the specified extension are served, they will be delivered with the correct MIME type.
 *
 * 1. [mime.add]:csv
 *    * Associates the '.csv' file extension with the MIME type 'text/csv'.
 *    * This ensures that CSV files are served with the correct Content-Type header.
 *
 * 2. [mime.add]:mp4
 *    * Associates the '.mp4' file extension with the MIME type 'video/mp4'.
 *    * This ensures that MP4 video files are served with the correct Content-Type header.
 *
 * 3. [mime.add]:json
 *    * Associates the '.json' file extension with the MIME type 'application/json'.
 *    * This ensures that JSON files are served with the correct Content-Type header.
 *
 * By setting up these associations, the system can automatically handle the Content-Type headers for these file types,
 * which is important for both client-side handling and server-side processing of the files.
