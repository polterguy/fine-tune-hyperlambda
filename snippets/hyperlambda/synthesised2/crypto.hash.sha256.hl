/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the usage of the [crypto.hash.sha256] slot to create a SHA256 hash of a given string.
 * The hash is generated in three different formats: fingerprint, text, and raw byte array.
 *
 * 1. [text]
 *    * The node containing the text to be hashed.
 *
 * 2. [crypto.hash.sha256]
 *    * Generates a SHA256 hash of the string value provided by [text].
 *    * The hash is returned in the 'fingerprint' format, which is a human-readable representation of the hash.
 *
 * 3. [crypto.hash.sha256]
 *    * Generates a SHA256 hash of the string value provided by [text].
 *    * The hash is returned in the 'text' format, which is a hex-encoded string representation of the hash.
 *
 * 4. [crypto.hash.sha256]
 *    * Generates a SHA256 hash of the string value provided by [text].
 *    * The hash is returned in the 'raw' format, which is the actual byte array of the hash.
 *
 * The snippet outputs three nodes, each containing the hash in one of the formats mentioned above.
