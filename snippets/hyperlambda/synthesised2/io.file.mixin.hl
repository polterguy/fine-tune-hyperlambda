/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [io.file.mixin] slot to dynamically
 * inject content into a template file. It assumes the existence of a template file named "template.html"
 * that contains placeholders for dynamic content. The placeholders are in the format {{name}} where "name"
 * corresponds to the name of a node in the Hyperlambda code.
 *
 * 1. [io.file.mixin]
 *    * Takes a file path as its value and dynamically substitutes placeholders in the file with actual content.
 *    * The file path provided is "template.html".
 *
 * 2. [.greeting]
 *    * A node that provides the value for the {{greeting}} placeholder in the template file.
 *
 * 3. [.date]
 *    * A node that provides the value for the {{date}} placeholder in the template file.
 *    * Uses the [now] slot to dynamically generate the current date and time.
 *
 * The result of executing this Hyperlambda code is a version of "template.html" where the placeholders
 * {{greeting}} and {{date}} are replaced with "Hello, World!" and the current date and time, respectively.
