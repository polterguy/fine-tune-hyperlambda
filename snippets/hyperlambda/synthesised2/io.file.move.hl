/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to move a file from one location to another on the server's file system.
 * It uses the [io.file.move] slot to perform the file move operation.
 *
 * 1. [io.file.move]
 *    * Moves a file from the specified source path to the destination path.
 *    * The source file in this example is located at "/var/data/config.json".
 *    * The destination path is "/var/backup/config-20230401.json".
 *    * After the operation, the file at the source path will no longer exist, as it has been moved to the destination.
 *
 * Note: The destination directory must exist before the move operation is attempted, otherwise an exception will occur.
