/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [http.patch] slot to send a PATCH request to a specified URL.
 * The request includes a JSON payload that is intended to partially update a resource at the given endpoint.
 *
 * 1. [http.patch]
 *    * Sends an HTTP PATCH request to the provided URL.
 *    * The URL is specified as the value of the [http.patch] node.
 *
 * 2. [headers]
 *    * Optional node to include HTTP headers in the request.
 *    * In this example, a Content-Type header is set to indicate the payload format.
 *
 * 3. [payload]
 *    * Contains the data to be sent as the body of the PATCH request.
 *    * The payload is a JSON object with a single property "status" set to "active".
 *
 * 4. [convert]
 *    * An optional argument that, when set to true, instructs the slot to automatically convert the response.
 *    * The conversion is based on the Content-Type of the response.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The [http.patch] slot will execute the PATCH request with the given payload and headers.
 * * If the [convert] argument is true and the response Content-Type is supported, the response will be converted to a Hyperlambda node structure.
