/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to execute a raw SQL DELETE statement using the [data.execute] slot.
 * The snippet assumes you have a table named 'test_table' in your database that you want to clear.
 *
 * 1. [data.connect] - Opens a database connection to the 'sakila' database.
 * 2. [data.execute] - Executes the raw SQL DELETE statement to remove all records from 'test_table'.
 *
 * After executing this Hyperlambda, 'test_table' will have all its records deleted.
 * It is important to use this slot with caution to avoid unintended data loss.
