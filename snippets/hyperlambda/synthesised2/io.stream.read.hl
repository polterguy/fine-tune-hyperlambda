/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to read the contents of an open stream using the [io.stream.read] slot.
 * The [io.stream.read] slot is designed to read data from a stream and output the content as a node value.
 *
 * 1. [.stream]
 *    * Represents an open stream from which data is to be read.
 *    * The stream could be from various sources such as an HTTP request object or a file stream.
 *
 * 2. [io.stream.read]
 *    * Reads the content of the stream referenced by the expression pointing to the [.stream] node.
 *    * The result of the read operation is placed as the value of the [io.stream.read] node.
 *
 * Usage Scenario:
 * * This pattern is typically used when you have a stream of data that you need to read into your Hyperlambda,
 *   such as when handling file uploads or reading data from a network stream.
