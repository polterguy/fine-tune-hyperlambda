/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [io.file.execute] slot to execute a Hyperlambda file.
 * The file is expected to contain Hyperlambda code, and it can be passed arguments for dynamic execution.
 *
 * 1. [io.file.execute]
 *    * Executes the specified Hyperlambda file located at the given path.
 *    * The file path is provided as the value to the [io.file.execute] slot.
 *
 * 2. [.arguments]
 *    * Represents the arguments that will be passed to the Hyperlambda file being executed.
 *    * It is a data node that contains child nodes representing each argument.
 *
 * 3. [arg1]
 *    * A child node of [.arguments] representing the first argument with a string value "Hello".
 *
 * 4. [arg2]
 *    * A child node of [.arguments] representing the second argument with an integer value 123.
 *
 * The Hyperlambda file at the specified path will be executed with the provided arguments.
 * The arguments can be accessed within the Hyperlambda file using lambda expressions to refer to the [.arguments] node.
