/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to delete records from a Microsoft SQL Server database table using the [mssql.delete] slot.
 * The deletion is conditionally based on specific field values using the [where] argument.
 *
 * 1. [mssql.delete]
 *    * Deletes records from the specified table in a Microsoft SQL Server database.
 *    * Requires a table name to be specified.
 *
 * 2. [table]
 *    * Specifies the name of the table from which records will be deleted.
 *
 * 3. [where]
 *    * Defines the conditions that must be met for a record to be deleted.
 *
 * 4. [and]
 *    * Combines multiple conditions that must all be true for the record to be deleted.
 *
 * 5. [field1]
 *    * The first condition in the [where] clause.
 *    * Specifies that the field named 'field1' must have the value 'value1' for the record to be deleted.
 *
 * 6. [field2]
 *    * The second condition in the [where] clause.
 *    * Specifies that the field named 'field2' must have the value 'value2' for the record to be deleted.
 *
 * The combination of [field1:value1] and [field2:value2] under the [and] node ensures that both conditions must be met for a record to be deleted.
 * If the conditions are met, the record(s) will be deleted from 'table1'.
