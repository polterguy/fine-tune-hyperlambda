/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the creation of a new database transaction for a Microsoft SQL Server database.
 * It shows how to use the transaction to perform a series of operations that will only be committed if all operations
 * succeed. If any operation fails, the transaction can be rolled back to ensure data integrity.
 *
 * 1. [mssql.connect]
 *    * Establishes a connection to a Microsoft SQL Server database using a connection string.
 *
 * 2. [mssql.transaction.create]
 *    * Begins a new database transaction within the context of the established connection.
 *
 * 3. [mssql.execute]
 *    * Executes an arbitrary SQL statement within the transaction. In this example, it's a placeholder for any SQL operation.
 *
 * 4. [mssql.transaction.commit]
 *    * Commits the transaction, making all changes within the transaction permanent in the database.
 *
 * If an error occurs during the execution of any SQL statement within the transaction, the [mssql.transaction.rollback]
 * slot should be used to revert all changes made in the transaction. This is typically done in a [.catch] block
 * following the transaction logic.
