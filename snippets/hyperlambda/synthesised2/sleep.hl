/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [sleep] slot to pause the execution of the current thread.
 * The [sleep] slot is used to introduce a delay in the execution flow, which can be useful for various reasons,
 * such as waiting for an external process to complete, or simply to throttle the execution speed.
 *
 * 1. [sleep]
 *    * Pauses the current thread for a specified duration in milliseconds.
 *    * In this example, the thread is paused for 5000 milliseconds, or 5 seconds.
 *
 * Usage:
 * * The [sleep] slot is typically used in scenarios where a delay is required without blocking other operations.
 * * It is important to note that [sleep] releases the thread back to the operating system, allowing for efficient
 *   use of system resources during the sleep period.

sleep:5000
// Pauses the execution for 5 seconds before continuing with subsequent operations.
