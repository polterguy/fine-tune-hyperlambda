/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet retrieves the scheme (HTTP or HTTPS) of the current request.
 * It is useful for determining whether the request was made over a secure connection (HTTPS)
 * or an insecure one (HTTP).
 *
 * 1. [request.scheme]
 *    * Retrieves the scheme of the current HTTP request.
 *    * The result will be either "http" or "https" depending on the protocol used.
 *
 * 2. [set-value]
 *    * Sets the value of the [.scheme] node to the result of [request.scheme].
 *    * This allows other parts of the Hyperlambda to use the scheme information.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The [.scheme] node will contain the value "http" or "https" after execution.
