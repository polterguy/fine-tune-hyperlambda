/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to refresh an existing JWT token using the [auth.ticket.refresh] slot.
 * The refreshed token will have a new expiration date, allowing the user to remain authenticated without re-logging in.
 *
 * 1. [auth.ticket.refresh]
 *    * Invokes the slot responsible for refreshing the JWT token.
 *    * Does not require any arguments.
 *    * Must be called within the context of an authenticated user session.
 *    * The slot assumes a valid JWT token is present in the HTTP Authorization header.
 *    * Returns a new JWT token with an updated expiration date.
 *
 * Usage:
 * * This slot is typically used in scenarios where the application needs to keep the user logged in for extended periods.
 * * It is often called periodically, before the current JWT token expires.
 * * The new token should replace the old token in the client's Authorization header for subsequent requests.
