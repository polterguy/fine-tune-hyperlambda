/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [neq] slot to compare two values for inequality.
 * It sets a condition to check if the value of the [.source] node is not equal to the static value 10.
 * If the condition is true, it sets the value of the [.result] node to "Values are not equal".
 *
 * 1. [.source:int:10]
 *    * A data node with an integer value of 10.
 *
 * 2. [neq]
 *    * The not equal comparison slot.
 *    * Compares the value of the [.source] node with the static value 10.
 *
 * 3. [if]
 *    * Conditional branching slot.
 *    * Executes child nodes if the condition is true.
 *
 * 4. [set-value]
 *    * Sets the value of the [.result] node.
 *    * Only executed if the [neq] condition is true.
 *
 * 5. [.]:"Values are not equal"
 *    * The value to set for the [.result] node if the condition is true.
 *
 * Result:
 * * If the [.source] node's value is not equal to 10, the [.result] node will be set to "Values are not equal".
