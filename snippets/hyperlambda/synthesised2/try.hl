/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [try] slot to create a try/catch/finally block.
 * Within this block, an exception is intentionally thrown and subsequently caught, with a log entry
 * recorded for both the catch and finally phases.
 *
 * 1. [try]
 *    * Begins a try block where exceptions can be caught.
 *    * Intentionally throws an exception with [throw].
 *
 * 2. [.catch]
 *    * Catches any exceptions thrown within the [try] block.
 *    * Logs an error message using [log.error].
 *
 * 3. [.finally]
 *    * Executes after the [try] block, regardless of whether an exception was caught.
 *    * Logs a final message using [log.info].
 *
 * The purpose of this code is to illustrate exception handling in Hyperlambda and to ensure that
 * certain actions (like logging) are performed whether or not an exception occurs.
