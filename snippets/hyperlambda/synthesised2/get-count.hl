/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [get-count] slot to count the number of child nodes
 * under a specific node in the lambda structure. It sets up a data node with several children and then
 * uses [get-count] to determine how many child nodes exist under the [.data] node.
 *
 * 1. [.data] - A data node that acts as a container for child nodes. It is used here to provide a context for the count operation.
 *    * The children of this node are arbitrary and serve as the items to be counted.
 *
 * 2. [get-count] - The slot that performs the counting of child nodes.
 *    * It takes an expression pointing to the nodes to be counted, in this case, all children of the [.data] node.
 *    * The result of [get-count] will be the number of child nodes, which is returned as the value of the [get-count] node itself.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The final result of [get-count] will be an integer representing the number of child nodes under [.data].
