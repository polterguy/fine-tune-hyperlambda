/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [data.delete] slot to delete records from a database table.
 * It specifies a table and conditions for deletion using the [where] argument.
 *
 * 1. [data.delete]
 *    * Initiates the deletion of records from a specified table.
 *    * Requires a [table] node to define which table to delete from.
 *
 * 2. [where]
 *    * Specifies the conditions that must be met for records to be deleted.
 *    * Uses logical AND to combine multiple conditions.
 *
 * 3. [and]
 *    * Combines multiple conditions that must all be true for the deletion to occur.
 *
 * 4. [field1.eq]
 *    * Represents the first condition where the field 'field1' must equal 'value1'.
 *
 * 5. [field2.eq]
 *    * Represents the second condition where the field 'field2' must equal 'value2'.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The snippet will delete all records from 'table1' where 'field1' equals 'value1' and 'field2' equals 'value2'.
