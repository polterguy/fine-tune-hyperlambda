/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet converts a lambda object into a Hyperlambda string representation.
 * The conversion allows for serialization of the lambda object, which can be used for storage,
 * transmission, or further processing in its textual form.
 *
 * 1. [.data]
 *    * A data segment node used to hold the lambda object that will be converted.
 *    * It contains child nodes representing the structure of the lambda object.
 *
 * 2. [lambda2hyper]
 *    * The slot responsible for converting the lambda object into a Hyperlambda string.
 *    * It takes the lambda object from the [.data] node as its input.
 *
 * 3. [.result]
 *    * A node that will hold the resulting Hyperlambda string after conversion.
 *    * This node is where the output of [lambda2hyper] will be stored.
 *
 * The process involves creating a lambda object within the [.data] node, which is then
 * passed to the [lambda2hyper] slot. The output is a Hyperlambda string that represents
 * the original lambda object, and this string is stored in the [.result] node.
