/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [for-each] loop to iterate over a collection of nodes.
 * Each node's value is then modified to a new value within the loop.
 *
 * 1. [.data]
 *    * Defines a data segment with child nodes that will be iterated over.
 *
 * 2. [for-each]
 *    * Iterates over each child node of [.data].
 *    * Uses the [x] expression to point to the children of [.data].
 *
 * 3. [set-value]
 *    * Sets the value of the current node being iterated over.
 *    * The [x] expression points to the current node using the [#] iterator, which dereferences the node.
 *    * The new value is set to "updated".
 *
 * Result:
 * * Each child node of [.data] will have its value changed to "updated".
