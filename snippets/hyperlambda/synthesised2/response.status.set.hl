/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet sets the HTTP response status code to a specific value.
 * It is useful when you need to indicate a certain status of the HTTP response, such as an error or success.
 *
 * 1. [response.status.set]
 *    * Sets the HTTP response status code.
 *    * In this example, it sets the status code to 404, which indicates that the requested resource was not found.
 *
 * The status code is an important part of the HTTP response as it informs the client about the result of the request.
 * For instance, a 200 status code means success, while a 500 status code indicates a server error.
 * By setting the status code explicitly, the server can communicate the outcome of the request to the client.
