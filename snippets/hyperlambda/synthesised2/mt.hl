/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet uses the [mt] slot to compare two integer values and sets a result node based on the outcome.
 * The comparison checks if the first value is greater than the second value.
 *
 * 1. [.first-value:int:10]
 *    * A data node holding the first integer value for comparison.
 *
 * 2. [.second-value:int:5]
 *    * A data node holding the second integer value for comparison.
 *
 * 3. [mt]
 *    * The "more than" comparison slot that compares the values of its child nodes.
 *    * It takes two arguments: the first is the value to compare from, and the second is the value to compare against.
 *
 * 4. [get-value:x:@.first-value]
 *    * Retrieves the value of the first integer for comparison.
 *
 * 5. [.]
 *    * A node representing the second integer value for comparison.
 *
 * 6. [set-value:x:@.comparison-result]
 *    * Sets the value of the [.comparison-result] node based on the outcome of the [mt] comparison.
 *
 * 7. [.]
 *    * A node representing the outcome value to be set, which is a boolean indicating whether the first value is greater than the second.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The [.comparison-result] node will hold a boolean value of 'true' since 10 is greater than 5.
