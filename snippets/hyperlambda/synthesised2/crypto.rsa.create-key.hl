/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the creation of an RSA keypair, which is essential for various cryptographic operations.
 * The snippet includes optional parameters to customize the strength and seed of the keypair generation process.
 *
 * 1. [crypto.rsa.create-key]
 *    - Generates a new RSA keypair.
 *    - Optional [strength] parameter to define the bit length of the keys, affecting the security level.
 *    - Optional [seed] parameter to provide a custom seed for the random number generator, enhancing security.
 *    - Returns four nodes containing the private key, public key, and their fingerprints.
 *
 * 2. [strength]
 *    - Specifies the strength of the keypair in bits.
 *    - A higher value like 4096 bits is recommended for enhanced security.
 *
 * 3. [seed]
 *    - Provides a custom seed value for the key generation process.
 *    - Using a custom seed can increase the cryptographic strength by making the key generation less predictable.
 *
 * The resulting RSA keypair can be used for encrypting data, creating digital signatures, and other cryptographic tasks.
 * The keypair includes both private and public keys, where the private key must be kept secret, and the public key can be shared.
 * The fingerprints are unique identifiers for the keys, useful for referencing and verifying the keys without exposing their actual values.
