/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [yield] slot within a dynamically created slot.
 * The [yield] slot is used to return a value from a dynamic slot created with [slots.create].
 *
 * 1. [slots.create] - Creates a new dynamic slot named "math.addition".
 *    * The dynamic slot performs an addition operation on two input arguments "number1" and "number2".
 *
 * 2. [validators.mandatory] - Ensures that the "number1" and "number2" arguments are provided.
 *    * It validates the presence of these arguments in the [.arguments] node.
 *
 * 3. [math.add] - Adds the values of "number1" and "number2".
 *    * Retrieves the values using [get-value] and sums them up.
 *
 * 4. [yield] - Returns the result of the addition from the dynamic slot.
 *    * The result is placed in a node named "sum" which will be the output of the dynamic slot.
 *
 * The dynamic slot "math.addition" can be executed using the [execute] slot, passing the required arguments.
 * The [yield] slot ensures that the result of the dynamic slot's computation is returned to the caller.
