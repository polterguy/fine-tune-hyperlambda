/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.transaction.rollback] slot to roll back a database transaction.
 * The example assumes that a transaction has been created and some database operations have been performed within that transaction.
 * If a condition is met, the transaction is rolled back, undoing all the operations performed within the transaction scope.
 *
 * 1. [data.connect] - Establishes a connection to a database using the provided connection string or database name.
 *    * The connection is used for subsequent database operations.
 *
 * 2. [data.transaction.create] - Starts a new database transaction.
 *    * All database operations following this slot are part of the transaction until it is committed or rolled back.
 *
 * 3. [data.execute] - Executes a SQL command that modifies the database (e.g., an INSERT operation).
 *    * The example uses a placeholder SQL command for illustration purposes.
 *
 * 4. [if] - Evaluates a condition to determine if the transaction should be rolled back.
 *    * The condition is represented by a placeholder that should be replaced with actual logic.
 *
 * 5. [data.transaction.rollback] - Rolls back the transaction if the condition in the [if] slot is true.
 *    * This undoes all database operations performed since the transaction was created.
 *
 * 6. [else] - Specifies an alternative path if the condition in the [if] slot is false.
 *    * The example includes a placeholder for operations to be performed if the transaction is not rolled back.
 *
 * 7. [data.transaction.commit] - Commits the transaction if the condition in the [if] slot is false.
 *    * This makes all database operations performed within the transaction permanent.
 *
 * Note: The actual condition for rolling back the transaction and the SQL command should be provided based on the specific use case.
