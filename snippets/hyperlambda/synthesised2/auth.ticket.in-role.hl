/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to specific roles.
 * It uses the [auth.ticket.in-role] slot to verify the user's roles without throwing an exception if the check fails.
 *
 * 1. [auth.ticket.in-role]
 *    * Verifies if the authenticated user is in any of the specified roles.
 *    * Takes a comma-separated list of role names as its value.
 *    * Returns true if the user is in one of the roles, otherwise false.
 *
 * 2. [if]
 *    * Evaluates a condition and executes child nodes if the condition is true.
 *
 * 3. [log.info]
 *    * Logs an informational message if the user is in the specified role.
 *
 * 4. [else]
 *    * Executes child nodes if the condition in the [if] slot is not met.
 *
 * 5. [log.error]
 *    * Logs an error message if the user is not in the specified role.
 *
 * The code first checks if the user is in the 'admin' or 'editor' roles. If the user is in one of these roles,
 * it logs an informational message. If the user is not in any of the specified roles, it logs an error message.
