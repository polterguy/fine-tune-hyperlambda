/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet counts the number of log entries in the system, optionally matching a specified filter condition.
 * It uses the [log.count] slot to achieve this.
 *
 * 1. [log.count]
 *    * Counts the number of log entries in the system.
 *    * Can optionally take a string value as a filter condition to count only the log entries that match the filter.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * * To count all log entries: [log.count]
 * * To count log entries containing the word "error": [log.count:"error"]
 *
 * The result of the [log.count] invocation will be the total number of log entries that match the filter condition,
 * or the total number of log entries if no filter is provided.
