/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [json2lambda-stream] slot, which is used to convert a JSON string
 * into a lambda object stream. This is particularly useful when dealing with large JSON payloads that need to be processed
 * as a stream to reduce memory usage and improve performance.
 *
 * 1. [json2lambda-stream]
 *    * Converts a JSON string into a lambda object stream.
 *    * The JSON string is provided as an argument to the slot.
 *    * The result is a stream of lambda objects that can be processed sequentially.
 *
 * 2. [for-each]
 *    * Iterates over each lambda object in the stream produced by [json2lambda-stream].
 *    * Within the loop, the current lambda object is referenced using the [.dp] node.
 *
 * 3. [set-value]
 *    * Sets the value of a specified node within the lambda object.
 *    * In this example, it's used to modify the value of the "name" node within each lambda object in the stream.
 *
 * 4. [yield]
 *    * Returns the modified lambda object back to the stream.
 *
 * The example assumes that the JSON string represents an array of objects, each with a "name" property. The [for-each] loop
 * modifies the "name" property of each object to "Updated Name".
