/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet retrieves the capabilities of the current log implementation.
 * It is used to determine what features the log system supports, such as filtering log items,
 * timeshifting log items, and other implementation-specific features.
 *
 * 1. [log.capabilities]
 *    * Retrieves a list of capabilities supported by the log implementation.
 *    * The result will contain various nodes indicating the features available.
 *
 * Usage:
 * * To check if the log system supports a specific feature, such as querying by content,
 *   you can examine the nodes returned by this slot.
 * * This is useful before attempting to use features like [log.query] with content filtering,
 *   to ensure the log system supports such operations.
