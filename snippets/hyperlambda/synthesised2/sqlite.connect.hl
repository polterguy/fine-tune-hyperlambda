 * with a SQLite database file. The database file is specified by its name or path in the value of the slot.
 *
 * 1. [sqlite.connect]
 *    * Establishes a connection to the SQLite database.
 *    * The value "my-database.db" represents the name of the SQLite database file.
 *
 * Usage:
 * * The snippet is used to initiate a database connection before performing any database operations such as
 *   queries, updates, or transactions.
 * * It is important to ensure that the database file exists and is accessible by the application.
 *
 * Result:
