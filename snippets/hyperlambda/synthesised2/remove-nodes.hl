/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to remove specific nodes from a collection of nodes within a graph object.
 * The [remove-nodes] slot is used to target and remove nodes that match a certain criteria defined by a lambda expression.
 *
 * 1. [.data]
 *    * Defines a data segment with several child nodes that represent items in a list.
 *
 * 2. [remove-nodes]
 *    * Targets and removes nodes from the [.data] node collection based on the provided lambda expression.
 *    * In this example, it removes nodes with the name "item-to-remove".
 *
 * Result:
 * * After execution, the [.data] node will no longer contain any child nodes named "item-to-remove".
