/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of [return-value] within a dynamically created slot.
 * The [return-value] slot is used to return a single value from the dynamic slot upon its invocation.
 *
 * 1. [slots.create]
 *    * Creates a dynamic slot named "calculate-sum".
 *    * The dynamic slot expects two arguments: "number1" and "number2".
 *
 * 2. [math.add]
 *    * Adds the values of "number1" and "number2" together.
 *
 * 3. [return-value]
 *    * Returns the result of the addition as the value from the dynamic slot.
 *
 * 4. [signal]
 *    * Invokes the dynamic slot "calculate-sum" with two integer arguments.
 *    * The result of the dynamic slot invocation will be the sum of the two provided numbers.
 *
 * Example Invocation:
 * * The dynamic slot "calculate-sum" is invoked with the numbers 10 and 20.
 * * The [return-value] will return the sum, which is 30.
