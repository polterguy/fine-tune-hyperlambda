/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the generation of a cryptographic fingerprint for a given data payload.
 * The fingerprint is a hashed representation of the data, making it easier to handle and compare.
 *
 * 1. [.payload] - A data node that holds the content for which the fingerprint will be generated.
 *
 * 2. [crypto.fingerprint] - The slot that generates the cryptographic fingerprint of the data.
 *    * Takes the data from [.payload] as input.
 *    * Uses the SHA256 algorithm to create the hash.
 *    * Outputs the fingerprint as a string node.
 *
 * The resulting fingerprint is a SHA256 hash of the input data, encoded as a string.
 * This fingerprint can be used as a unique identifier for the data, for instance, to verify integrity or to index in a database.
