/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [http.get] slot to perform an HTTP GET request to a specified URL.
 * It also shows how to include custom HTTP headers in the request and how to handle the response.
 *
 * 1. [http.get]
 *    - Initiates an HTTP GET request to the specified URL.
 *    - The URL is provided as the value of the [http.get] slot.
 *
 * 2. [headers]
 *    - Specifies custom HTTP headers to be included in the GET request.
 *    - Each child node represents a header field where the node name is the header name and the node value is the header value.
 *
 * 3. [set-value]
 *    - Sets the value of a specified node.
 *    - In this example, it sets the value of the [.response-content] node to the content returned by the HTTP GET request.
 *
 * 4. [get-nodes]
 *    - Retrieves a set of nodes from the lambda object.
 *    - Here, it retrieves the HTTP response headers returned by the server.
 *
 * 5. [add]
 *    - Adds a new node to the lambda object.
 *    - In this case, it adds the response headers under the [.response-headers] node for further processing or inspection.
 *
 * The final lambda object will contain the response content under the [.response-content] node and the response headers under the [.response-headers] node.
