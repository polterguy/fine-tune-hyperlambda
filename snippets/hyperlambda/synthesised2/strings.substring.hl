/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet extracts a specific portion of a string using the [strings.substring] slot.
 *
 * 1. [.original-text]
 *    * Holds the string from which a substring will be extracted.
 *
 * 2. [strings.substring]
 *    * Extracts a substring from the string provided in the [.original-text] node.
 *    * The first child node specifies the starting index (0-based) for the substring.
 *    * The second child node specifies the length of the substring to extract.
 *
 * Result:
 * * A new node with the name [substring-result] containing the extracted substring.
