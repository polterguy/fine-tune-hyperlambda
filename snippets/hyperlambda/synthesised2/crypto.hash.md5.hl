/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the usage of the [crypto.hash.md5] slot to create an MD5 hash of a given string.
 * MD5 is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value. It is commonly used to
 * check the integrity of files. However, it is not recommended for security-sensitive applications as it is vulnerable to
 * collision attacks.
 *
 * 1. [.data] - A data node that holds the string to be hashed.
 *
 * 2. [crypto.hash.md5] - The slot that takes the string from the [.data] node and computes its MD5 hash.
 *    * It uses the value of the [.data] node as input for the hash computation.
 *    * The resulting MD5 hash is stored in the [hash] node as a hexadecimal string.
 *
 * Note: The MD5 algorithm is included for legacy support and should not be used for new applications that require
 * cryptographic security.
