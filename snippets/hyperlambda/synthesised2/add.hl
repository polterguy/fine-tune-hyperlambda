/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to append child nodes to a destination node.
 * The [add] slot is used to dynamically add nodes into a destination node's children collection.
 *
 * 1. [.destination]
 *    * This is the destination node where new child nodes will be added.
 *
 * 2. [add]
 *    * The [add] slot takes an expression pointing to the destination node.
 *    * It will append all child nodes of [add] as children of the [.destination] node.
 *
 * 3. [.]
 *    * Represents a node that will be added to the destination node.
 *    * Contains child nodes [foo] and [bar] with their respective values.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The [.destination] node will end up with two new child nodes named [foo] and [bar].
