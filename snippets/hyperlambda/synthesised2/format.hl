/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [format] slot to format a date and time value
 * according to a specified pattern and culture setting. It also shows how to format a decimal number
 * with a Norwegian culture setting to use a comma as the decimal separator.
 *
 * 1. [format]
 *    * Formats the value of the [date] node as a string according to the specified pattern.
 *    * Uses the "dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm" pattern to represent the date and time in a specific format.
 *    * Applies the "en-US" culture to format the date with the English (United States) culture conventions.
 *
 * 2. [format]
 *    * Formats the value of the [amount] node as a string according to the specified pattern.
 *    * Uses the "N2" pattern to represent the decimal number with two decimal places.
 *    * Applies the "nb-NO" culture to format the number with the Norwegian Bokm√•l culture conventions,
 *      which uses a comma as the decimal separator.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The first [format] invocation will output the date and time as "19.01.2023 12:49".
 * * The second [format] invocation will output the decimal number as "12345,67".
