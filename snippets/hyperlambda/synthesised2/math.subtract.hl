/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [math.subtract] slot to perform subtraction operations.
 * It calculates the difference between a dynamic value retrieved from a node and a static value.
 *
 * 1. [.initial-value]
 *    * Declares a node with an integer value of 10, which will be used as the minuend in the subtraction.
 *
 * 2. [math.subtract]
 *    * Performs the subtraction operation.
 *    * It starts with the value of [.initial-value] as the minuend.
 *
 * 3. [get-value]
 *    * Retrieves the value of [.initial-value] to be used in the subtraction.
 *
 * 4. [.]:int:3
 *    * Declares a static integer value of 3, which will be used as the subtrahend.
 *
 * The result of the subtraction (10 - 3) will be stored in the [result:int] node, yielding a final value of 7.
