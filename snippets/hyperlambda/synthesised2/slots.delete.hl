/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to delete a dynamically created slot using the [slots.delete] slot.
 * The snippet includes the creation of a dynamic slot, invocation of that slot, deletion of the slot, and an
 * attempt to invoke the deleted slot which will result in an exception.
 *
 * 1. [slots.create]
 *    * Creates a dynamic slot named "my-dynamic-slot" that returns a static integer value of 42.
 *
 * 2. [signal]
 *    * Invokes the "my-dynamic-slot" slot, which will return the value 42.
 *
 * 3. [slots.delete]
 *    * Deletes the "my-dynamic-slot" slot, making it unavailable for further invocations.
 *
 * 4. [try-signal]
 *    * Attempts to invoke the "my-dynamic-slot" slot after deletion, which will not throw an exception
 *      but will not execute the slot since it has been deleted.
 *
 * 5. [signal]
 *    * Attempts to invoke the "my-dynamic-slot" slot after deletion, which will throw an exception
 *      because the slot no longer exists.
