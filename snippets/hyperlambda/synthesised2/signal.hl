/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to invoke a dynamically created slot using the [signal] slot.
 * The [signal] slot is used to execute a slot that has been previously defined with [slots.create].
 *
 * 1. [slots.create] - Creates a new dynamic slot named "my-dynamic-operation".
 *    * The slot performs a simple addition of two integer values.
 *    * It uses [math.add] to add the values and [yield] to return the result.
 *
 * 2. [signal] - Invokes the dynamically created slot "my-dynamic-operation".
 *    * It passes two integer values as arguments for the addition operation.
 *    * The result of the operation will be stored as the value of the [signal] node.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The final result of the [signal] invocation is the sum of the two integer arguments.
