/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet establishes a connection to a Microsoft SQL Server database.
 * It uses the [mssql.connect] slot to connect to a database specified by the connection string name "generic"
 * and the database name "crm". The connection string must be defined in the application's configuration file.
 *
 * 1. [mssql.connect]
 *    * Establishes a database connection using a predefined connection string from the application's configuration.
 *    * The connection string is identified by "generic" and the database name is "crm".
 *    * The connection will be used for subsequent database operations enclosed within this node.
 *
 * 2. [mssql.read]
 *    * Reads data from the "contacts" table in the database.
 *    * The read operation is scoped within the database connection established by [mssql.connect].
 *
 * 3. [limit]
 *    * Limits the number of records returned by the [mssql.read] operation to 10.
 *
 * The code assumes that the "contacts" table exists within the "crm" database and that the "generic" connection string
 * is correctly configured to point to the desired SQL Server instance.
