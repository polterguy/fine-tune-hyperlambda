/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet retrieves a context object named "user-session" that was previously stored using the [context] slot.
 * It then sets the value of the [.result] node to the value of the "user-session" context object.
 *
 * 1. [context]
 *    * Adds an object named "user-session" with a value of "active" onto the stack.
 *    * The context object is accessible within the scope of the [.lambda] node.
 *
 * 2. [get-context]
 *    * Retrieves the context object named "user-session" from the stack.
 *
 * 3. [set-value]
 *    * Sets the value of the [.result] node to the value retrieved by [get-context].
 *
 * The final result is that the [.result] node will have the value "active".
