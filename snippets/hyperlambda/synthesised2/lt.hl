/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet uses the [lt] slot to compare two integer values and determine if the first value is less than the second value.
 * The result of this comparison can be used to conditionally execute further logic based on whether the condition is true or false.
 *
 * 1. [.source-value:int:10]
 *    * A node that holds the first integer value for comparison.
 *
 * 2. [lt]
 *    * The "less than" comparison slot that takes two arguments and returns true if the first argument is less than the second.
 *
 * 3. [get-value]
 *    * Retrieves the value of the [.source-value] node to be used as the first argument in the [lt] comparison.
 *
 * 4. [.comparison-value]
 *    * A static node that holds the second integer value for comparison as the second argument in the [lt] comparison.
 *
 * If the value of [.source-value] is less than the value of [.comparison-value], the [lt] slot will evaluate to true.
 * In this example, since 10 is less than 20, the [lt] slot will indeed evaluate to true.
