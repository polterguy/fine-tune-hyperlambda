/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to count the number of items in the cache.
 * It uses the [cache.count] slot to retrieve the total count of cached items.
 *
 * 1. [cache.set] - Adds a new item to the cache with a specified key and value.
 *    * The key is "my-cache-item" and the value is "Hello Cache".
 *    * It also sets an expiration time for the cache item, which is 60 seconds.
 *
 * 2. [cache.count] - Retrieves the total number of items currently stored in the cache.
 *    * The result of this slot will be the count of all cache items.
 *
 * The expected outcome after execution is that the cache will contain at least one item,
 * and the [cache.count] will return the total number of items, which should be a minimum of 1.
