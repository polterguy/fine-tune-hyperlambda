/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [try-signal] slot to invoke a dynamic slot without throwing an exception if the slot does not exist.
 *
 * 1. [try-signal]
 *    * Attempts to invoke a dynamic slot named "my-dynamic-operation".
 *    * Does not throw an exception if the slot "my-dynamic-operation" is not found or does not exist.
 *    * This is useful for invoking slots that may or may not be present in the system, allowing for optional functionality.
 *
 * 2. [log.info]
 *    * Logs an informational message indicating whether the dynamic slot was successfully invoked or not.
 *    * The message changes based on the existence of the dynamic slot.
 *
 * 3. [if]
 *    * A conditional check to determine the message to log.
 *    * Uses the [eq] slot to compare the value of the [try-signal] node to a static value.
 *
 * 4. [eq]
 *    * Compares the value of the [try-signal] node to a static value of "success".
 *    * Used as a condition within the [if] slot to determine the execution path.
 *
 * 5. [.lambda]
 *    * The lambda block that is executed if the condition is true.
 *    * Contains the [log.info] slot to log a success message.
 *
 * 6. [else]
 *    * The default else block that is executed if the condition in the [if] slot is false.
 *    * Contains the [log.info] slot to log a failure message.
 *
 * The purpose of this code is to safely attempt to invoke a dynamic slot and handle the outcome gracefully, without causing an exception to be thrown and potentially disrupt the flow of the application.
