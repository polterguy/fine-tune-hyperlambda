/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet sorts a list of books based on their publication year in ascending order.
 * The sorting is done using a custom comparison logic within the [sort] slot.
 *
 * 1. [.data]
 *    * The data node contains a list of book nodes, each with a title and a publication year.
 *
 * 2. [sort]
 *    * The sort slot takes an expression leading to a list of nodes to sort.
 *    * It uses a lambda object to determine the sorting order based on the publication year.
 *
 * 3. [if]
 *    * An if statement that compares the publication years of the left-hand side (lhs) and right-hand side (rhs) book nodes.
 *    * Sets the result to -1 if lhs should come before rhs (ascending order).
 *
 * 4. [else-if]
 *    * An else-if statement that sets the result to 1 if lhs should come after rhs.
 *
 * 5. [else]
 *    * An else statement that sets the result to 0 if lhs and rhs are equal in terms of sorting order.
 *
 * The result is a sorted list of book nodes by their publication year in ascending order.
