/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet converts a lambda object into its YAML representation.
 *
 * 1. [.data] - A data segment containing structured information.
 *    * Consists of multiple child nodes with names and values representing properties.
 *
 * 2. [lambda2yaml] - Converts the lambda object to a YAML formatted string.
 *    * Takes the [.data] node and its children as the input for conversion.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The output will be a YAML string that represents the structured data initially contained within the [.data] node.
