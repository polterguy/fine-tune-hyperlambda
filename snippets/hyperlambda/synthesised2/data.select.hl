/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.select] slot to execute a raw SQL query
 * and retrieve the first five actors from the 'actor' table in the 'sakila' database. It assumes that
 * the 'sakila' database is installed and the default database type is MySQL.
 *
 * 1. [data.connect]
 *    - Opens a database connection to the 'sakila' database.
 *
 * 2. [data.select]
 *    - Executes the specified raw SQL query within the established database connection.
 *    - The SQL query selects the 'first_name' and 'last_name' columns from the 'actor' table.
 *    - Limits the results to the first five records.
 *
 * Result:
 * - The result will be a lambda object with each actor's first and last name as separate nodes.
 * - Each actor's information is encapsulated within a node with an empty name (represented as "" in Hyperlambda).
