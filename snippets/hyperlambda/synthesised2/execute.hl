/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [execute] slot to invoke a dynamic slot named "calculate-sum".
 * The dynamic slot "calculate-sum" takes two arguments, "number1" and "number2", adds them together, and yields the result.
 *
 * 1. [slots.create] - Creates a new dynamic slot named "calculate-sum".
 *    - The slot performs a mandatory check on its arguments to ensure they are provided.
 *    - It then adds the two numbers and yields the result.
 *
 * 2. [validators.mandatory] - Ensures that the "number1" and "number2" arguments are provided.
 *
 * 3. [math.add] - Adds the values of "number1" and "number2".
 *
 * 4. [yield] - Returns the result of the addition from the dynamic slot.
 *
 * 5. [execute] - Invokes the dynamic slot "calculate-sum" with the provided arguments.
 *    - The arguments "number1" and "number2" are passed with integer values.
 *
 * Result:
 * - The final result of the [execute] slot is the sum of the two numbers, which is yielded by the dynamic slot.
