/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [cache.try-get] slot to attempt to retrieve an item from the cache.
 * If the item does not exist in the cache, the [cache.try-get] slot will execute the provided [.lambda] block to create the item,
 * save it to the cache with the specified key, and then return the newly created item.
 *
 * 1. [cache.try-get]
 *    - Attempts to retrieve an item from the cache using the specified key "user-preferences".
 *    - If the item is not found in the cache, it will execute the [.lambda] block.
 *
 * 2. [expiration]
 *    - Sets the expiration time for the cache item to 60 seconds.
 *
 * 3. [.lambda]
 *    - A lambda block that is executed if the cache item is not found.
 *    - It returns a string value "default-preferences" which will be saved to the cache.
 *
 * Result:
 * - If the cache item with the key "user-preferences" exists, its value will be returned.
 * - If the cache item does not exist, the [.lambda] block is executed, and "default-preferences" is saved to the cache and returned.
