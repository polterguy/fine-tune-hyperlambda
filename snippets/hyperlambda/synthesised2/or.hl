/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [or] slot to evaluate logical conditions.
 * The [or] slot checks if any of its child conditions are true and short-circuits if a true condition is found.
 *
 * 1. [or]
 *    * Evaluates child conditions to determine if any are true.
 *    * Short-circuits evaluation upon finding the first true condition.
 *
 * 2. [.:bool:false]
 *    * A child condition with a static value of false.
 *
 * 3. [.:bool:true]
 *    * A child condition with a static value of true.
 *
 * 4. [set-value]
 *    * Sets the value of a specified node.
 *
 * 5. [get-value]
 *    * Retrieves the value of a specified node.
 *
 * 6. [if]
 *    * Conditional branching that executes child nodes if the condition is true.
 *
 * 7. [.result]
 *    * A variable node that will store the result of the logical evaluation.
 *
 * The code first evaluates an [or] condition with two child conditions. The first child is false, and the second is true.
 * Due to the nature of [or], the overall condition evaluates to true. The [if] slot then checks this condition, and since it is true,
 * it sets the value of the [.result] node to "Condition met". If the [or] condition were false, the [.result] node would remain unchanged.
