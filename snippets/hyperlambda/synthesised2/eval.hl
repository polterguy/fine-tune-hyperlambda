/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [eval] slot to execute a lambda object.
 * The lambda object is defined as a child node of the [eval] slot and sets the value of the [.result] node.
 *
 * 1. [.result] - A data segment node that will hold the result of the lambda execution.
 *
 * 2. [eval] - The execution slot that will run the lambda object defined as its child node.
 *
 * 3. [set-value] - A slot within the lambda object that sets the value of the [.result] node to "Execution successful".
 *
 * The lambda object is directly provided as a child of [eval], and upon execution, the value of [.result] will be updated.
 * This example illustrates a simple use case of [eval] without any expressions pointing to external nodes.
