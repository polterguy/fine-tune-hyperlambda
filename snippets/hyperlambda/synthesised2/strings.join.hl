/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to join multiple strings into a single string with a specified separator.
 * The separator is defined as a comma followed by a space.
 *
 * 1. [.source]
 *    * A data segment containing the strings to be joined.
 *    * Contains three child nodes with string values "apple", "banana", and "cherry".
 *
 * 2. [strings.join]
 *    * Joins the values of all child nodes of [.source] into a single string.
 *    * Uses a comma followed by a space as the separator between each string.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The final result is a single string "apple, banana, cherry".
