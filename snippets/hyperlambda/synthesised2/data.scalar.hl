 * 1. [data.connect]
 *    * Opens a database connection to the 'sakila' database.
 *
 * 2. [data.scalar]
 *    * Executes a SQL query to count the total number of actors in the 'actor' table.
 *    * The result is returned as a single scalar value.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The final result of [data.scalar] is the total count of actors as a long integer.
