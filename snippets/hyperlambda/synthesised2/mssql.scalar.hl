/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [mssql.scalar] slot to execute a scalar SQL query
 * against a Microsoft SQL Server database and retrieve a single value result, such as a count of rows.
 *
 * 1. [mssql.connect] - Establishes a connection to a Microsoft SQL Server database.
 *    * The connection string or database name is provided as the value of this slot.
 *
 * 2. [mssql.scalar] - Executes a scalar SQL query that returns a single value.
 *    * The SQL query is provided as the value of this slot.
 *    * Scalar queries are typically used for aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, etc.
 *
 * 3. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.result] node to the result of the scalar query.
 *    * The value is retrieved using the [get-value] slot, which fetches the value of the [mssql.scalar] node.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The final value of the [.result] node will be the single scalar value returned by the SQL query.
