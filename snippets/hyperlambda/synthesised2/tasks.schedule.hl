/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to schedule a task to be executed at a specific future date and time.
 * The task is first created with a unique identifier and a lambda block that will be executed when the task runs.
 * Then, the task is scheduled using the [tasks.schedule] slot with a [due] argument specifying the exact date and time for execution.
 *
 * 1. [tasks.create]
 *    * Creates a new task with a unique identifier.
 *    * The task contains a lambda block that logs a message when executed.
 *
 * 2. [tasks.schedule]
 *    * Schedules the previously created task to be executed at a specific date and time in the future.
 *    * The [due] argument specifies the exact UTC date and time for the task execution.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * * A task is created to log a message "Scheduled task executed" at the specified time.
 * * The task is scheduled to run on December 31, 2025, at 23:59 UTC.
 *
 * Result:
 * * The task will be executed once at the specified future date and time, logging the message.
