/*
 * This example demonstrates the use of the [**] lambda operator, which selects all descendant nodes of a given root.
 * We have a nested structure under [.root], eventually leading to the [target] node.
 * The expression will recursively search all children, grandchildren, etc., until it finds [target].
 * [set-value] updates the value of [target] from '42' to '84'.
