/*
 * This snippet dynamically selects a node [middle] in the [row] structure and moves to the next sibling using the [ + ] iterator.
 * [middle] is followed by [end], so [get-value] resolves to the value of [end] ('Right').
 * Demonstrates how the [ + ] iterator can be embedded inside broader expressions for relative access.
