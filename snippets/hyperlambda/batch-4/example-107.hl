 * This snippet walks through a structure of three levels of nodes using the wildcard `*`, combined with explicit node names.
 * Starting from [.config], it dives into [environment], then [settings], and finally into [timeout].
 * The lambda expression allows for flexible navigation through each layer.
 * [set-value] changes the [timeout] value from '30' to '60'.
