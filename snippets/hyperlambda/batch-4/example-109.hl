/*
 * Within the [items] node, there are four sibling nodes: [one], [two], [three], [four].
 * The lambda expression begins at [one] and uses two chained [ + ] operators to jump forward to the second-next sibling.
 * Therefore, [three] is selected, and its value ('Third') is returned via [get-value].
