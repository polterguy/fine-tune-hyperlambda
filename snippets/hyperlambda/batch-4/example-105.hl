/*
 * This snippet demonstrates how to access a deeply nested node by chaining wildcard selections and specifying target node names.
 *
 * The node tree starts with a root node [.company], which contains a child node [department], which in turn contains a node [manager].
 * We use the lambda expressionto traverse down to the [manager] node.
 * [set-value] then changes the value of [manager] from 'Alice' to 'Bob'.
