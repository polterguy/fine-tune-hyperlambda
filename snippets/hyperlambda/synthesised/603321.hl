/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to join the values of nodes within a list using a specified separator.
 * The [.data] node contains a list of nodes, and the [strings.join] slot is used to concatenate their values.
 * A comma followed by a space (", ") is used as the separator between each node's value.
 * This is useful for creating a single string from multiple values, with a specified delimiter.
