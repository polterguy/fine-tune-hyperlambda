/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [get-value] slot to retrieve the value of a specific node.
 * In this example, the [.info] node has a child node named [bar] which exists but has no value.
 * The [get-value] invocation attempts to retrieve the value of the [bar] node.
 * Since the [bar] node exists but has no value, the result of [get-value] will be null.
