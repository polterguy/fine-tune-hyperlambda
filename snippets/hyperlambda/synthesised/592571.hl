/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [get-value] slot to retrieve the value of a specific node.
 * In this example, the [.data] node has a child node named [foo] which exists but has no value.
 * The [get-value] invocation attempts to retrieve the value of the [foo] node.
 * Since the [foo] node exists but has no value, the result of [get-value] will be null.
