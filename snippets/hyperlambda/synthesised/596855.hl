/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of `get-first-value` to retrieve a single value.
 * 
 * 1. The [.source] node is initialized with the value `"bar1"`.
 * 2. The [get-first-value] slot is used to fetch this value.
 * 3. The expected result is "bar1".
 *
 * If you remove the value of [.source], the value of [get-first-value] will be "default" instead.
