/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to count the number of child nodes
 * under a node named [.collection]. The [get-count] slot is used to retrieve the count
 * of nodes that are direct children of the [.collection] node.
 *
 * Since [.collection] has two children, the value of [get-count] will be 2 after execution.
