/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to execute a Hyperlambda file with arguments.
 * It first sets up an [.args] node with two children, [foo1] and [foo2], each having a value.
 * The [execute-file] slot is then used to run the "/whatever-file.hl" file.
 * The arguments [arg1] and [arg2] are passed to the file, evaluated from the [.args] node.
 * This results in the file receiving the values of "bar1" and "bar2" for [arg1] and [arg2] respectively.
