/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet retrieves the value of the [age] node from within the [payload] node,
 * which is a child of the [.input] node. The [payload] node is assumed to be of type `node`, and 
 * dereferencing is used to access its children nodes. The expression navigates through the hierarchy 
 * to extract the desired [age] value.
