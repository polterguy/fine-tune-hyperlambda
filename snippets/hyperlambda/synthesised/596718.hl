/*
 * This example demonstrates how to join multiple strings stored as values in the children of the [.items] node.
 * The [strings.join] slot is used to concatenate the strings, inserting a specified separator between each.
 * In this case, the separator is a vertical bar "|", resulting in a single string with each word separated by "|".
