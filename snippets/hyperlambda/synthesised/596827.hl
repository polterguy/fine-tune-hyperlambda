/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates various ways to handle strings, including the use of multi-line strings, 
 * different quoting styles, and escaping special characters. It shows how to declare string variables without 
 * quotes when no special characters are present, how to use double quotes when a colon is included, and how to 
 * utilize the @ notation for multi-line strings. Additionally, it illustrates the use of single quotes and 
 * escaping newline characters within strings.
