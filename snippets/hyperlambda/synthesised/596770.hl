/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [whitelist] slot to restrict the available slots within a given scope.
 * The [whitelist] slot is used to specify a subset of slots that can be invoked within a [.lambda] block.
 * In this example, only [return] and [vocabulary] are whitelisted, so attempting to use [set-value] will result in an exception.
 * The [.lambda] block is isolated from the rest of the code, ensuring that only the whitelisted slots can be executed.
