/*
 * This example demonstrates how to use the [auth.ticket.verify] slot to enforce role-based access control.
 * The slot will throw an exception if the authenticated user does not belong to the specified role.
 * In this case, "non-existing-role" is used as an example of a role that does not exist, 
 * hence an exception will be thrown when this code is executed.
