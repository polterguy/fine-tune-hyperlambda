 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [sql.read] slot to generate SQL that selects records from the "people" table.
 * The results are ordered by the "name" column in descending order. The [order] node specifies the column to sort by,
 * and the [direction] node indicates the sorting direction.
