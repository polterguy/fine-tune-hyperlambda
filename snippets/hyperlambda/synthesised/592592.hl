/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet multiplies an initial base value with a static factor and the result of a nested addition operation.
 * It begins by multiplying the base value of 4 with a static factor of 3, resulting in an intermediate product of 12.
 * Subsequently, it performs an addition of two integers (1 + 1), yielding 2.
 * Finally, the intermediate product of 12 is multiplied by the result of the addition (2), resulting in a final product of 24.

      // First term in the addition operation
      .:int:1

      // Second term in the addition operation (1 + 1 = 2)
      .:int:1

   // The intermediate product 12 is then multiplied by 2 (from the nested addition), resulting in a final product of 24
