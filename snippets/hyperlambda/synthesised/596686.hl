/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to change the name of a node.
 * The [set-name] slot is used to rename the node [previous-name] to 'updated-name' within the [.container] node.
 * The expression in [set-name] points to the node to be renamed, and the new name is provided as the child node's value.
