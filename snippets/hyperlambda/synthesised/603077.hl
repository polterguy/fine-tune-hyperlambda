/*
 * This Hyperlambda endpoint facilitates the deletion of a single record from the "media" table in the "cms" database.
 * It is designed for admin users, ensuring that only authorized personnel can perform this operation.
 * The endpoint requires a mandatory "id" argument, which serves as the primary key for the record to be deleted.
 * It verifies the user's authorization, connects to the SQLite database, and executes the delete operation.
 * Finally, it returns the result of the deletion operation to the caller.
