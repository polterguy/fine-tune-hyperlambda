 * This Hyperlambda code iterates over the configuration settings and copies their values into the corresponding runtime placeholders.
 * It starts by defining configuration settings with default values and runtime placeholders without values.
 * The [for-each] loop iterates over each setting, retrieves the name of the current setting, and sets the value of the corresponding runtime placeholder.
