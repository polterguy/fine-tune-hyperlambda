/*
 * This code snippet demonstrates the use of the '.' iterator to access the parent node of a specified child node.
 * The [get-name] slot is used to retrieve the name of the node, which in this case is ".container".
 * The expression navigates to the [element] node and then retrieves its parent node's name.
