/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to establish a connection to a SQLite database named 'bar'
 * using a connection string labeled 'default'. It then proceeds to create a backup of the database, saving it
 * under the filename 'bar.backup'. This is useful for ensuring data safety by creating a copy of the database
 * that can be restored in case of data loss or corruption.
