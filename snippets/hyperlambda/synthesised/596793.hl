/*
 * This Hyperlambda code evaluates an "or" condition to determine if at least one of its arguments is true.
 * If the condition evaluates to true, it executes a lambda object that sets the value of the [.output] node to "Success".
 * This demonstrates the use of logical "or" in conditional branching to execute actions based on multiple conditions.
