/*
 * This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the node that is the next sibling of the node [item2] within the [.collection] node.
 * The '+' iterator is used to navigate to the elder sibling of the specified node.
 *
 * The result of the [get-value] invocation will be 'C' since [item3] is the next node after [item2], and the
 * `+` iterator will ensure it retrieves the value of the next node after [item2].
