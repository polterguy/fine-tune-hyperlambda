/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet illustrates the behavior of the [get-name] slot when there are no matching nodes.
 * 
 * 1. The [.info] node is present but lacks children nodes named [bar].
 * 2. The `get-name` slot attempts to retrieve a name but finds none.
 * 3. The expected result is `null`.
