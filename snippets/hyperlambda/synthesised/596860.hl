/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [mt] slot, which performs a "more than" comparison.
 * The code checks if the value of the [.y] node is greater than 5. If the value of [.y] is not greater than 5,
 * the [mt] slot will return false. This is useful for conditional logic where you need to verify if one value
 * exceeds another.
 *
 * The value of [mt] will be false after execution since [.y] is not greater than 5.
