/*
 * This example demonstrates how to use the [strings.mixin] slot to embed the result of a dynamic slot call within a string.
 * Here, we are embedding the current year obtained from the [date.now] slot into a string.
 * The [strings.mixin] slot allows you to execute Hyperlambda code inline and insert the result into the surrounding string.
 * Resulting in something resembling; "Year now is 04/10/2025 06:11:29".
