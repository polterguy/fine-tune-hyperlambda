 * This Hyperlambda code generates a cryptographically secure random integer within a specified range.
 * The random integer is generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSRNG),
 * ensuring high entropy and unpredictability. The range is defined by the [min] and [max] values,
 * which in this case are set to 1 and 100, respectively.
