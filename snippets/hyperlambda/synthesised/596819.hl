/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [whitelist] slot without specifying any whitelisted slots.
 * The code attempts to execute a [set-value] operation within the [.lambda] block, but since no slots are
 * whitelisted, this should result in an exception. The [.lambda] block is isolated and cannot access any slots
 * outside of the whitelisted vocabulary, which in this case is empty.
