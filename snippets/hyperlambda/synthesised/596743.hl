/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is responsible for loading environment-specific configurations.
 * It achieves this by executing a configuration loader file located at "/modules/config/load.hl".
 * The current environment is specified by the [.environment] node, which in this case is set to "production".
 * This environment value is then passed as an argument to the loader file as an [end] argument, allowing it to load
 * the appropriate settings for the specified environment.
