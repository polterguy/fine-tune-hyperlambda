 * This Hyperlambda code checks multiple conditions to determine if a user should receive a message about their subscription status.
 * It evaluates whether the user's role is "premium", the subscription is "active", and there are less than 7 days left.
 * If all conditions are true, it sets a message indicating that the subscription will expire soon.
