/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a loop that continues to execute until the [.counter] node reaches a value of 10.
 * It initializes [.counter] to 1, then enters a [while] loop that checks if [.counter] is less than 10.
 * Within the loop, it logs a message indicating a task is being processed and increments the [.counter] by 1.
