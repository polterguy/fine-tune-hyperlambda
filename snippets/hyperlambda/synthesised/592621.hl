/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to convert a value to a single-precision floating-point number (float).
 * The [.value] node is initialized with an integer value of 5.
 * The [convert] slot is used to change the type of the value to a float.
 * The value of [convert] will be the floating point representation of the integer after execution.
