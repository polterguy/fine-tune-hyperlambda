/*
 * HTTP endpoint to manually execute an existing scheduled task by its [id], executing it asynchronously.
 *
 * Functionality:
 * - Requires the caller to be authenticated with root privileges using [auth.ticket.verify:root].
 * - Accepts a single argument [id], which is the unique identifier of the scheduled task.
 * - Uses a [fork] block to execute the task in a background thread, allowing the HTTP endpoint
 *   to return immediately without waiting for the task to complete.
 * - This is useful for manually triggering long-running or heavy background tasks without blocking the frontend.
 * - After spawning the thread, the endpoint immediately returns a success response to the caller.
