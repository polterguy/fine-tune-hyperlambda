/*
 * This endpoint deletes a scheduled task from the Magic task scheduler by its unique identifier.
 *
 * - It expects an [id] argument, which represents the name or ID of the task to be deleted.
 * - The endpoint is protected by role-based access control and only allows access to users
 *   with root-level privileges, verified through [auth.ticket.verify:root].
 * - Upon successful verification, it invokes [tasks.delete] with the given [id] to remove the task.
 * - After deletion, it returns a result node containing the string "Success" to indicate
 *   that the task was successfully removed.
 *
 * This endpoint is useful for administrative operations where scheduled or recurring tasks
 * need to be programmatically managed and removed from the system.
