/*
 * Returns a list of all dynamic slots currently registered in the system.
 *
 * This Hyperlambda endpoint allows administrative users to retrieve all slots dynamically loaded
 * into the Magic backend. These slots may represent custom business logic, reusable server functions,
 * or plugin-provided extensions. This information is essential for introspection, diagnostics,
 * or building developer tools such as low-code editors or slot explorers.
 *
 * ### Access Control:
 * - Only users with the `root` role may invoke this endpoint.
 *   This is enforced using [auth.ticket.verify:root].
 *
 * ### Arguments:
 * - This endpoint takes **no arguments**.
 *
 * ### Behavior:
 * 1. Calls [slots.vocabulary] to retrieve all registered dynamic slots in the current system.
 *    These are typically defined using [slots.create] or loaded via modules.
 * 2. Returns the result as a flat list of fully-qualified slot names (e.g., `magic.auth.authenticate`).
 *
 * ### Returns:
 * - A list of dynamic slot identifiers currently active in the system.
 *
 * Example response:
 * ```
 * [
 *   "magic.auth.authenticate",
 *   "magic.user.get-profile",
 *   "custom.reports.generate-pdf"
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * This endpoint is useful for backend developers, admins, and tool builders who need
 * to explore what functionality is available and dynamically invocable in the system.
