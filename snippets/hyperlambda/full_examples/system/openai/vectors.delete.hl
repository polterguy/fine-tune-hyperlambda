/*
 * Deletes all existing vector embeddings for training snippets associated with a specified model type.
 *
 * This endpoint is used to fully reset or clean up the vector representation (VSS) layer for a model.
 * It removes both the stored embeddings from the VSS table and clears the `embedding` field in the main training data table.
 *
 * INPUT PARAMETERS:
 * - [type:string]: The logical training model or type whose associated vectors should be removed.
 *
 * EXECUTION FLOW:
 *
 * 1. **Authorization & Validation**:
 *    - Ensures only users with root-level access can invoke the endpoint via [auth.ticket.verify:root].
 *    - Validates the presence of the required [type] parameter using [validators.mandatory].
 *
 * 2. **Database Connection**:
 *    - Connects to the database using the configured [generic|magic] connection string.
 *
 * 3. **Vector Deletion (VSS Cleanup)**:
 *    - Executes a SQL command to delete all rows from `vss_ml_training_snippets` where the [rowid] matches the IDs
 *      of training snippets from the `ml_training_snippets` table having the specified [type].
 *    - This removes the actual vector embedding data from the vector search storage layer.
 *
 * 4. **Embedding Field Reset**:
 *    - Runs an update on `ml_training_snippets` to set the `embedding` field to `null` for all snippets of the given type.
 *    - This ensures that any metadata indicating that a snippet was vectorized is cleared.
 *
 * 5. **Final Response**:
 *    Returns `{ result: success }` to the caller, confirming that the cleanup was completed.
 *
 * This endpoint is essential for maintenance, debugging, or retraining workflows where all existing embeddings
 * need to be discarded before regenerating new onesâ€”particularly when switching vector models or correcting corrupt data.
