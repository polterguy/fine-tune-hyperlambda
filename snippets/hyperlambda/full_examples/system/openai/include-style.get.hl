/*
 * Returns a CSS file used for styling an embedded ChatGPT UI widget.
 *
 * This endpoint dynamically loads and returns a CSS file with optional theming,
 * allowing flexible styling of the ChatGPT widget based on runtime parameters.
 * It delegates the actual CSS generation and resolution to a reusable handler file
 * located at [/system/openai/include-style.css.get.hl].
 *
 * INPUT PARAMETERS:
 * - [file:string]: Required. Base name (without `.css` extension) of the stylesheet to load.
 * - [position:string]: Optional. Used to conditionally style the widget based on its screen position (e.g., "bottom-right").
 * - [color:string]: Optional. Defines the primary theme color via CSS custom properties.
 * - [link:string]: Optional. Sets a color for hyperlinks inside the widget.
 * - [start:string]: Optional. Start color for a background gradient.
 * - [end:string]: Optional. End color for a background gradient.
 * - [v:string]: Optional. A version hash or token used for cache busting.
 *
 * EXECUTION FLOW:
 *
 * 1. **Argument Forwarding**:
 *    - Passes all received arguments to the underlying CSS generation file via [execute-file].
 *    - Allows the inner file to handle advanced logic such as minification fallback, default theming,
 *      or applying overrides through CSS variables.
 *
 * 2. **Delegation**:
 *    - Executes the logic defined in [/system/openai/include-style.css.get.hl], which is responsible
 *      for resolving and rendering the final CSS.
 *
 * 3. **Response**:
 *    - Returns the CSS file with appropriate HTTP headers (e.g., `Content-Type: text/css`),
 *      ready to be served as a public asset or embedded in `<link>` or `<style>` tags.
 *
 * This endpoint is useful for scenarios where a ChatGPT-style widget is injected into a host website
 * and requires theming consistency with the host's branding or layout positioning.
