/*
 * Creates a new folder on the server at the specified path.
 *
 * This Hyperlambda endpoint allows a root user to create a new directory on the serverâ€™s filesystem,
 * using the provided [folder] path. It ensures secure usage by restricting access to only root-level users.
 *
 * ### Access Control:
 * - Only users with the `root` role may invoke this endpoint.
 *   Enforced via [auth.ticket.verify:root] to protect filesystem access.
 *
 * ### Arguments:
 * - `folder` (string): Required. The absolute or relative path to the folder you wish to create.
 *   If any parent folders in the path do not exist, this operation may fail unless they are manually created first.
 *
 * ### Behavior:
 * 1. Authenticates the caller and confirms root-level privileges.
 * 2. Attempts to create the folder at the specified path using [io.folder.create].
 * 3. Returns a static success response if the operation completes without error.
 *
 * ### Returns:
 * - `result:success`: A simple confirmation indicating the folder was created.
 *
 * ### Example:
 * Request:
 * ```
 * {
 *   "folder": "/modules/uploads/assets/"
 * }
 * ```
 * Response:
 * ```
 * result:success
 * ```
 *
 * ### Notes:
 * - If the folder already exists, the operation will typically succeed silently unless restricted by permissions.
 * - No attempt is made to sanitize or validate the folder path. Consider enforcing safe folder locations if exposed to UI clients.
