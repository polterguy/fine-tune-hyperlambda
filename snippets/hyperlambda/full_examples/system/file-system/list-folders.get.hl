/*
 * Lists all folders inside a specified directory.
 *
 * This Hyperlambda endpoint returns a list of immediate subdirectories found within the specified [folder] path.
 * It is typically used for server-side folder navigation in administrative panels or developer tools.
 *
 * ### Access Control:
 * - Only users with the `root` role may invoke this endpoint.
 *   This is enforced using [auth.ticket.verify:root] to prevent unauthorized filesystem access.
 *
 * ### Arguments:
 * - `folder` (string): Required. The absolute or relative path to the directory to inspect.
 *
 * ### Behavior:
 * 1. Verifies the caller is authorized as a root user.
 * 2. Uses [io.folder.list] to retrieve all immediate subfolders located within the specified path.
 *    - This is not recursive; only folders directly inside the target directory are returned.
 * 3. Returns the list of folder paths to the client.
 *
 * ### Returns:
 * - A flat list of folder paths inside the given directory.
 *
 * ### Example Response:
 * ```
 * [
 *   "/modules/users",
 *   "/modules/auth",
 *   "/modules/logs"
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * ### Notes:
 * - If the specified folder does not exist or is inaccessible, the result will be empty or may throw an exception.
 * - This endpoint is useful when building custom file managers, deployment tools, or diagnostic UIs.
