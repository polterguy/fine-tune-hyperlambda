/*
 * Returns the Magic CAPTCHA JavaScript library with server-specific public key and URL embedded.
 *
 * This endpoint serves the Magic CAPTCHA JavaScript to the client by delegating its execution to
 * the internal handler located at `/system/misc/magic-captcha.js.get.hl`. This script is dynamically
 * generated at runtime to inject:
 * - A unique server-specific public key (derived from the double SHA256 of the serverâ€™s auth secret).
 * - The correct scheme and host for API requests (`http` or `https` + `request.host`).
 *
 * ### Arguments:
 * - `v` (string, optional): Version tag, used as a cache buster or for future CDN optimization. Currently unused in logic.
 *
 * ### Behavior:
 * 1. Forwards all input arguments into the delegated handler using `[execute-file]`.
 * 2. The internal handler performs the following:
 *    - Loads either a minified or raw JavaScript file.
 *    - Replaces `[[public-key]]` and `[[url]]` placeholders with runtime values.
 *    - Returns the result with `Content-Type: text/javascript`.
 *
 * ### Use Cases:
 * - Used by browser-based CAPTCHA solvers that rely on dynamic content.
 * - Prevents replay attacks by binding CAPTCHA tokens to specific server environments.
 * - Ideal for embedding in public forms, user registration workflows, or spam-protected endpoints.
 *
 * ### Notes:
 * - If you want to serve this from a CDN, ensure dynamic placeholder substitution is done at build or edge runtime.
 * - The JavaScript returned is tied to the identity and configuration of the server where the request is made.
