/*
 * Sends a system-generated email to the cloudlet owner using Markdown-formatted body content.
 *
 * This HTTP endpoint sends an email **from** the cloudlet owner **to** the cloudlet owner, using default
 * name and email settings from configuration. It is useful for system-triggered notifications, logs, or alerts
 * that do not require a user-defined reply-to address. The message body is passed in as Markdown and is
 * automatically transformed to HTML before sending.
 *
 * ### Arguments:
 * - `body` (string, required): The email content, written in Markdown. This will be HTML-encoded for safety
 *   and then converted into HTML for proper rendering in email clients.
 *
 * ### Behavior:
 * 1. **HTML Encoding**:
 *    - HTML-encodes the `body` input to prevent HTML injection or formatting issues.
 *
 * 2. **Markdown Conversion**:
 *    - Converts the encoded body content from Markdown to HTML using a reusable workflow action.
 *
 * 3. **Configuration Lookup**:
 *    - Retrieves the owner's name and email from configuration keys:
 *      - `magic:smtp:from:name` → Sender and recipient name
 *      - `magic:smtp:from:address` → Sender and recipient email
 *    - These values are used for both the `from`, `to`, and `reply-to` headers, ensuring consistency and no user input leakage.
 *
 * 4. **Email Sending**:
 *    - Sends the final email with:
 *      - Static subject line: `"Email from Magic Cloudlet"`
 *      - The converted HTML body
 *      - Both sender and recipient using the configuration-based identity
 *      - Marks the content as HTML with `html: true`
 *
 * 5. **Returns**:
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "result": "success"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example Use Case:
 * - Internal alert like “Low disk space” or “User signup completed.”
 * - Background task completion notice to the owner.
 * - System health report summary.
 *
 * ### Notes:
 * - No reply-to or external user input is used in the email's metadata (sender/recipient), making this safe for internal system messages.
 * - Subject is static and hardcoded as `"Email from Magic Cloudlet"` to prevent subject spoofing or variability.
