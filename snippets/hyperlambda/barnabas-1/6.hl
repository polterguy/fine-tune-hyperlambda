 * Iterates over each child node under [.data] and logs their values using [log.info].
 *
 * Demonstrates how to use [for-each] to process multiple data nodes dynamically.
 * In this example, it logs "Apple", "Banana", and "Cherry" one by one.
 *
 * Useful as a template for handling structured input, logging, or applying other
 * actions across a collection of similar items.
