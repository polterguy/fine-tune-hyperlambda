/*
 * 1. The [if] slot evaluates whether both [.email] and [.password] nodes have boolean true values.
 * 2. The [and] slot combines the results of [get-value]:x:@.email and [get-value]:x:@.password, returning true only if both are true.
 * 3. If the condition is satisfied, [set-value] updates the [.validation] node with the string "User is valid".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating user login credentials before proceeding with authentication.
 * - Ensuring both email and password fields are filled and valid in a registration workflow.
 * - Checking multiple prerequisite flags before enabling access to a secure section of an application.
 * - Confirming a user's state is appropriate before executing actions like sending a confirmation email.
