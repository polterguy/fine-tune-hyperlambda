/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return a value from a dynamic slot or endpoint. In this case, it returns a node named [orders].
 * 2. The [orders] node's value is set using an expression `:x:@http.get/*/content/*`, which retrieves all child nodes of the [content] node(s) found under the [http.get] node(s) in the current execution context.
 * 3. This pattern is typically used after an HTTP GET request, where the response content (such as a list of orders) is extracted and returned as the result of the operation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a list of orders fetched from an external API in a structured format.
 * - Wrapping the content of an HTTP GET response inside an [orders] node for further processing or as an API response.
 * - Standardizing the output of a dynamic slot or endpoint to always return order data under the [orders] node.
