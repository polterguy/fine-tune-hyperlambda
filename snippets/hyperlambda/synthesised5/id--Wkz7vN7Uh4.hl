/*
 * 1. The first slot assigns a simple string value without quotes to the [.foo] node, demonstrating that unquoted strings are allowed if no special characters are present.
 * 2. The second slot assigns a string value wrapped in double quotes to the [.foo] node, which includes an escaped newline character (`\n`) to illustrate how escape sequences are supported within quoted strings.
 * 3. The third slot assigns a multi-line string to the [.foo] node, using the `@"..."` syntax to enable line breaks within the string value, similar to C# verbatim strings.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Assigning regular text or sentences to a node for later processing or output.
 * - Storing text data that includes special characters or control sequences, such as line breaks, tabs, or quotes.
 * - Saving formatted, multi-line content such as descriptions, messages, or code snippets inside a Hyperlambda node.
