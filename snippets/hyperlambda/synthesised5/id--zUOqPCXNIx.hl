/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node specifies that two string arguments, [role] and [user], are required for this operation.
 * 2. [auth.ticket.verify] ensures that only users with the [root] role are authorized to execute this logic, enforcing strict access control.
 * 3. [validators.mandatory] is used twice to validate that both the [role] and [user] arguments are supplied; otherwise, execution will halt with an error.
 * 4. [data.connect] establishes a connection to either the "generic" or "magic" database, setting up the context for subsequent database operations.
 * 5. [add] dynamically appends all argument nodes from [.arguments] as conditions to the [and] node inside the [where] clause for the database deletion.
 * 6. [data.delete] deletes records from the [users_roles] table that match all the conditions specified in the [where]/[and] clause (i.e., matching [role] and [user]).
 * 7. [unwrap] evaluates all immediate sibling nodes, ensuring the results from the database operation are accessible.
 * 8. [return] outputs the number of affected rows from the [data.delete] operation using the [affected] node.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Removing a user's role assignment from the [users_roles] database table by specifying the [role] and [user] to target.
 * - Enforcing that only superusers (those with the [root] role) can manage role assignments, preventing unauthorized deletions.
 * - Performing strict validation on required arguments to ensure database integrity.
 * - Useful in administrative dashboards or APIs for user-role management, where role revocation is needed.
 * - Can be adapted to similar scenarios requiring secure, validated deletions based on multiple parameters.
