/*
 * 1. The [throw] slot is used to raise an exception with the message "Something went wrong when invoking HTTP POST".
 * 2. When executed, this will immediately terminate the current execution flow and signal an error condition.
 * 3. If not caught by a [.catch] block, the exception may propagate to the client, depending on the environment and configuration.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To signal a failure after an unsuccessful HTTP POST operation.
 * - To enforce error handling logic in workflows that depend on successful HTTP communication.
 * - To provide clear error messages for debugging or client feedback when an HTTP POST cannot be completed.
