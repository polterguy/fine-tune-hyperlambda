/*
 * 1. The [mysql.connect] slot establishes a connection to the "inventory" MySQL database, setting the context for subsequent database operations.
 * 2. The [mysql.delete] slot is used to remove records from the [products] table in the connected database.
 * 3. The [where] node specifies a conditional clause, using an [and] node to combine two conditions: [stock.eq:int:0], which filters for products with a stock value of zero, and [discontinued.eq:bool:true], which filters for products marked as discontinued.
 * 4. The [yield] slot returns a message stating that discontinued and out-of-stock products have been deleted, providing a user-friendly confirmation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up inventory by removing products that are no longer available and have no remaining stock.
 * - Automating database maintenance tasks to keep product data up to date and relevant.
 * - Implementing a periodic job that purges obsolete product entries, ensuring accurate inventory reporting.
 * - Supporting business rules that require discontinued and depleted products to be deleted for compliance or operational efficiency.
