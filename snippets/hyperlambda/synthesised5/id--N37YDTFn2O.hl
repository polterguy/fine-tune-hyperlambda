/*
 * 1. The [.message] node is created with the value "This is a secret message".
 * 2. The [crypto.aes.encrypt] slot encrypts the value from the previous node (referenced using `:x:-`), using "some-secret-password" as the passphrase. The result is an AES-encrypted message.
 * 3. The [crypto.aes.decrypt] slot then decrypts the previously encrypted message (again referenced with `:x:-`), using the same password to recover the original plaintext.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Securely transmitting a message by encrypting it before sending and decrypting upon receiving with a shared password.
 * - Temporarily storing sensitive information in an encrypted form, then decrypting for later use.
 * - Demonstrating symmetric encryption and decryption workflow for educational purposes.
 * - Protecting configuration values or secrets in scripts with AES, using a human-readable passphrase.
