/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot checks if the [CustomerID] node exists as a child of any node under [.arguments]. If [CustomerID] is missing or its value is null, an exception is thrown, halting further execution.
 * 2. The expression x:@.arguments/*/CustomerID allows validation of multiple [CustomerID] nodes if there are several argument sets, ensuring each one is present and not null.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that an API endpoint receives a [CustomerID] argument before processing a request.
 * - Validating that each customer entry in a batch import includes a [CustomerID] field.
 * - Preventing accidental omission of required customer identifiers in user-submitted forms.
