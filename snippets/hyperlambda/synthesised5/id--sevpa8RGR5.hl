/*
 * 1. The [sql.read] slot is used to construct and execute a SQL SELECT statement, targeting the [people] table.
 * 2. The [order] child node specifies that the results should be sorted by the [name] column.
 * 3. The [direction] node, as a child of [order], sets the sorting order to descending (DESC).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve a list of people from the [people] table, ordered from Z to A by their [name] values.
 * - Display a leaderboard or directory where names need to appear in reverse alphabetical order.
 * - Export or paginate people data from a database, showing the most recent or last-in-list names first.
 * - Implement sorting options for a user interface where users can choose to view names in descending order.
