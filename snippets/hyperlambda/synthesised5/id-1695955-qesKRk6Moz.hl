/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by its expression argument. Here, the expression `:x:@.sql` locates the first node named [.sql] in the current context and extracts its value.
 * 2. The use of the @ iterator ensures that only the first matching [.sql] node is targeted, regardless of its position among siblings, and only its value is returnedâ€”not any child nodes or structure.
 * 3. This operation is read-only; it does not modify the [.sql] node or its children, but simply fetches the value for use elsewhere in the lambda graph.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the raw SQL string from a [.sql] node to display, log, or pass to another operation.
 * - Extracting configuration or query text stored in a [.sql] node for dynamic SQL execution.
 * - Validating or comparing the SQL statement content before running a database operation.
