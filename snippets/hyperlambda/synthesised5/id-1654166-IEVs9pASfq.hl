/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks a condition and only executes its [.lambda] child if the condition is true.
 * 2. The [not] slot inverts the result of its child condition, so the [.lambda] is executed if the string does NOT start with "http".
 * 3. The [strings.starts-with] slot checks if the value of [.url] inside [.arguments] starts with "http".
 * 4. The [set-value] slot updates the value of [.url] inside [.arguments].
 * 5. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates "https://" with the current value of [.url], ensuring the URL starts with "https://".
 * 6. The [get-value] slot retrieves the current value of [.url] from [.arguments].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring a user-provided URL always includes a protocol prefix before making HTTP requests.
 * - Normalizing URLs in API endpoints to avoid errors caused by missing "http://" or "https://".
 * - Preprocessing input data in web forms to enforce consistent URL formatting.
