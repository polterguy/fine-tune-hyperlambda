/*
 * 1. The [.ratio] node is being declared with a value of 0.75 and explicitly typed as a float.
 * 2. By prefixing the node name with a ".", it is treated as a data node rather than a slot, so it will not be executed but simply stored in the structure.
 * 3. The value 0.75 could be used as an input or configuration value in later parts of the Hyperlambda execution, such as to represent a percentage, a scaling factor, or any ratio-based calculation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Store the aspect ratio for an image resizing operation with [image.resize].
 * - Configure the threshold for a conditional check elsewhere in the workflow.
 * - Use as a multiplier or divisor in calculations using [math.multiply] or [math.divide].
 * - Define the minimum required ratio for passing a validation or quality check.
