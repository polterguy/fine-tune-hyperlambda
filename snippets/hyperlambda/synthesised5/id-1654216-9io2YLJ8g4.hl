 * 1. The [else] slot specifies an alternative execution path if previous [if] or [else-if] conditions were not met.
 * 2. The [throw] slot inside [else] raises an exception with the message "Something went wrong when invoking HTTP POST". This interrupts the normal flow and signals an error condition.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a clear error to the client if an HTTP POST operation fails.
 * - Ensuring that any unexpected failure in a preceding HTTP POST request is explicitly handled and does not go unnoticed.
 * - Providing a custom error message for logging or debugging when HTTP POST does not succeed.
