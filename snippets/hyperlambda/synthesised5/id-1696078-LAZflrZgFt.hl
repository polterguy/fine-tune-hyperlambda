/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the node referenced by the expression provided in its value. In this case, the expression `:x:@.sql` points to a node named [.sql] located at the same hierarchical level as the [get-value] invocation.
 * 2. [get-value] does not evaluate or execute the [sql] node itselfâ€”it simply extracts the stored value from [.sql], regardless of whether it is a raw string, a SQL statement, or some other data type.
 * 3. If [.sql] does not exist or its value is null, [get-value] will return a null result, which can be checked or handled in subsequent logic.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Accessing a dynamically generated SQL query stored in [.sql] for logging or further manipulation.
 * - Passing the extracted value from [.sql] to another slot that requires a SQL string as input.
 * - Checking the contents of [.sql] for debugging or validation before executing a database operation.
 * - Using [get-value] to conditionally branch logic based on the value stored in [.sql].
