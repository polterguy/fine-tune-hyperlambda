/*
 * 1. The [.hl] node holds a Hyperlambda script as a string, in this case an invocation of [log.info] to log a message.
 * 2. The [hyper2lambda] slot parses the text from the [.hl] node and transforms it into an executable lambda object (graph structure).
 * 3. The [eval] slot then executes the newly generated lambda structure.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically interpreting and executing Hyperlambda code received as text input.
 * - Loading and running scripts from configuration files or user-submitted content.
 * - Enabling runtime code injection for extensibility or scripting.
 * - Building admin panels that allow operators to run custom Hyperlambda scripts for diagnostics or automation.
