/*
 * 1. The [else] slot is used to define an alternative execution path, which is triggered if previous [if] or [else-if] conditions in the same conditional block have not been satisfied.
 * 2. The [set-value] slot assigns a new value to the [.sql] node, effectively updating the SQL query or statement being built or modified.
 * 3. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates multiple values together to build a complex string, in this case, incrementally constructing a SQL expression.
 * 4. Several [get-value] slots are used to retrieve the current values of the [.sql], [.fields], and [.no] nodes, which are then combined with static string fragments and dynamic node values.
 * 5. The overall concatenated string appears to construct a SQL segment that calculates the number of occurrences of a pattern within a field, using SQL length and replace functions.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically extending an SQL query to include a computed column for pattern occurrence counting.
 * - Building advanced search features in an API where the user can see or filter by how many times a certain string appears within a database field.
 * - Implementing logic that tracks and highlights repeated substrings or tokens in text-based columns.
 * - Generating analytics reports that need to quantify the presence of certain keywords in database records.
