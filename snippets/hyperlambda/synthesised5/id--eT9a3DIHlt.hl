/*
 * 1. The [.hl] node contains a simple lambda object where [log.info] is invoked to log a message.
 * 2. The [lambda2hyper] slot takes the lambda structure under the [.hl] node and serializes it into Hyperlambda text.
 * 3. The `:x:-/*` expression provided to [lambda2hyper] extracts all direct child nodes of the parent, effectively targeting the content of [.hl] for conversion.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Exporting a lambda object as Hyperlambda text so it can be saved to a file for backup or version control.
 * - Transmitting a lambda workflow over an API to another Magic server for remote execution.
 * - Converting a dynamic graph object to readable Hyperlambda text within a web-based editor or UI for user inspection.
 * - Enabling users to serialize a workflow for sharing or documentation purposes.
