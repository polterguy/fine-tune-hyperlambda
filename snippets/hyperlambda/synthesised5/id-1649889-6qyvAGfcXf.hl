/*
 * 1. [data.connect] opens a connection to the [northwind] database using the [generic] connection string, with the database type explicitly set to SQLite via the [database-type] node.
 * 2. [add] collects all argument nodes from [.arguments] and adds them as children to the [values] node under [data.create], effectively mapping incoming arguments as fields and values for the new record.
 * 3. [data.create] inserts a new record into the [Customers] table in the SQLite database, using the dynamically constructed [values] node for the field data.
 * 4. [response.status.set] sets the HTTP response status code to 201, indicating successful creation of a resource.
 * 5. [return] returns a result node with the value "success" as the response payload.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating a new customer record in the [Customers] table by passing customer data as arguments to an HTTP endpoint.
 * - Building a generic RESTful "create" endpoint for the [Customers] table in a SQLite-backed API.
 * - Automating the insertion of customer data into the Northwind database from external systems or user input.
