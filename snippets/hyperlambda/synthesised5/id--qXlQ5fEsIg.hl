/*
 * 1. [get-value] retrieves and returns the value of the node referenced by the expression provided in its value argument. In this example, the expression `x:-` points to the immediate previous sibling node, which is [.data].
 * 2. [.data] is a node with the value "Hello World". By referencing it using [get-value] with the `-` iterator, the value "Hello World" is extracted.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or data values stored in sibling nodes for processing.
 * - Fetching user input or parameters in a workflow for validation or manipulation.
 * - Returning a node's value as the result of a function or API endpoint.
 * - Dynamically referencing values in a sequence of nodes where the exact node position may vary.
