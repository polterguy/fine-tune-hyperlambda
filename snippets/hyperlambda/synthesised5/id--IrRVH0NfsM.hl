/*
 * 1. [if] checks whether the file [/var/logs/server.log] exists by invoking [io.file.exists].  
 * 2. If the file exists, [io.file.load] loads its contents.  
 * 3. [strings.matches] uses a regular expression to extract all URL patterns from the loaded file content.  
 * 4. [for-each] iterates through each [match] found by the regular expression, and [add] appends each found URL to the [.urls] node after using [unwrap] to get the actual string value.  
 * 5. [lambda2hyper] serializes all child nodes of [.urls] into a Hyperlambda string, which is then logged using [log.info], with the [emails] parameter containing the serialized URLs.  
 * 6. If the file does not exist, [log.error] writes an error stating the log file was not found.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically extract and log all URLs from a server log file for review or auditing.
 * - Quickly identify and serialize all external links accessed or mentioned in server logs for further automated processing.
 * - Alert administrators if the expected log file is missing, indicating potential system issues.
 * - Facilitate migration or backup of extracted URLs by serializing them in Hyperlambda format.
