/*
 * 1. The [include] slot iterates through each child node of [.data] using the expression `:x:@.data/*`. For every child node, it executes the lambda provided as its children.
 * 2. Inside each iteration, the [return] slot is invoked, returning a new [child] node with the value "added" for each item processed.
 * 3. The resulting [child] node is appended to every iterated [.data] child node, effectively extending them with new sub-nodes.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Augmenting each item in a data collection with additional child nodes, such as for tagging, annotation, or metadata enrichment.
 * - Automatically adding default or computed sub-nodes to a set of elements in a dynamic configuration object.
 * - Generating placeholder or status nodes under every entity in a list for further downstream processing.
