/*
 * 1. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all nodes referenced by its expression argument.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@tasks.get/*/schedules/*` navigates from the [tasks.get] node, accesses all its children, then finds the [schedules] node among those, and finally retrieves all children of [schedules].
 * 3. The result will be a node set containing all schedule nodes associated with the [tasks.get] node, typically representing all schedules for a specific task.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To programmatically access and process all schedules associated with a retrieved task.
 * - To iterate over each schedule of a task for display, modification, or deletion.
 * - To extract schedule details for reporting or auditing purposes.
