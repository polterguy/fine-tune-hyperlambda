/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks if the value of the [rating] node inside the current [.dp] node is more than 4.8 using the [mt] slot.
 * 2. If the condition is true, the [.lambda] block is executed, which uses the [add] slot to add a new child node named [bestseller] with the value true (as a boolean) to the current [.dp] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Marking products or items as bestsellers if their [rating] exceeds 4.8.
 * - Automatically flagging high-rated entries in a list for further processing or display.
 * - Enhancing a dataset by adding a [bestseller] attribute to records that meet a specific rating threshold.
