/*
 * 1. The [data.update] slot updates records in a database table specified by the [table] node, using a SQLite database as indicated by [database-type].
 * 2. The [values] node defines the columns and their new values, here updating [field1] to "howdy".
 * 3. The [where] node restricts which records are updated, using an [and] condition: [field2] must be greater than "someValue" ([field2.mt:someValue]), and [field3] must be less than or equal to 12345 ([field3.lte:int:12345]).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Updating a user's status in a table only if their score exceeds a certain value and their rank is below a threshold.
 * - Performing a bulk update to mark records as processed, but only for rows matching specific criteria.
 * - Maintaining data integrity by updating related fields conditionally based on multiple column values.
 * - Mass updating product prices where certain inventory and sales conditions are met.
