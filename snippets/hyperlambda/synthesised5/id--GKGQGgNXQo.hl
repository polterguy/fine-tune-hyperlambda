/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot is used to retrieve the value of a node specified by its expression argument.
 * 2. The expression `:x:..` refers to the parent node of the current node, so [get-value] will return the value of this parent node.
 * 3. This slot is commonly used when you need to access or manipulate the value of a node higher up in the hierarchy from within a nested context.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Accessing the value of a configuration or context node that is a parent of the current operation.
 * - Retrieving a value passed down from a previous processing step in a workflow.
 * - Implementing logic that depends on information stored in an ancestor node without hardcoding its name.
