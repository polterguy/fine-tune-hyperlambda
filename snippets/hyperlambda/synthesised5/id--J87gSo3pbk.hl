/*
 * 1. The [pgsql.connect] slot establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database named "monitoring".
 * 2. The [pgsql.execute] slot executes a raw SQL statement that creates a table called "events" if it does not already exist, with columns [id] (auto-increment primary key), [name] (required text), and [timestamp] (timestamp with time zone, defaulting to the current time).
 * 3. The [yield] slot returns a response with a [message] node confirming the outcome ("Events table created if it didn’t exist").
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Initializing the "events" table during application startup to ensure it exists before logging events.
 * - Automating database schema setup as part of a deployment or migration script.
 * - Self-healing database logic to recreate missing tables without manual intervention.
 * - Providing feedback to an API client or admin user that the table setup operation was performed.
