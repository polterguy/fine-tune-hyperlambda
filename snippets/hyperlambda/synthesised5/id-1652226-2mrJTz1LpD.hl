/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot is used to ensure that a required argument is present and not null.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/ProductID` targets all [ProductID] nodes that are children of any child node under [.arguments].
 * 3. If any targeted [ProductID] node does not exist or has a null value, an exception will be thrown, stopping further execution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating that a [ProductID] is provided in an API endpoint before processing a request.
 * - Ensuring that form submissions always include a [ProductID] field.
 * - Preventing further logic from executing if [ProductID] is missing in a batch of input records.
