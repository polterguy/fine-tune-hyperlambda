/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@.sql`. This expression points to the first node named [.sql] that appears before the current node in the execution tree.
 * 2. [get-value] is typically used to extract scalar values (like strings, numbers, or booleans) from nodes, which can then be used as arguments for other slots, or for further computation and conditional logic.
 * 3. The use of the `@` iterator ensures that only the first matching [.sql] node encountered in the reverse traversal is selected, making it useful for extracting configuration or result values scoped higher in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching a generated SQL string from a previously defined [.sql] node to log or display it to the user.
 * - Accessing the result of a previous SQL generation step for further manipulation, such as appending additional clauses or parameters.
 * - Dynamically retrieving context-specific values (like connection strings or query templates) from earlier nodes in a workflow.
