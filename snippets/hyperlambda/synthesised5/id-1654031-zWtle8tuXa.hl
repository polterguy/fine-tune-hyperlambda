/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a connection to a database using a specified adapter, in this case either [generic] or [magic].
 * 2. The [data.execute] slot runs a raw SQL command that deletes records from the [vss_ml_training_snippets] table where the [rowid] matches the [id] values from the [ml_training_snippets] table filtered by a [type] parameter.
 * 3. The [type] parameter for the SQL statement is dynamically set using the value from the [.type] node via the expression `:x:@.type`.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Bulk deleting records from [vss_ml_training_snippets] that are associated with a specific [type] in [ml_training_snippets].
 * - Performing a cleanup operation where you do not need to retrieve or process any result data after deletion.
 * - Executing a parameterized SQL delete statement within a workflow that dynamically determines the [type] of records to remove.
