/*
 * 1. The [add] slot appends a new child node to the [.even_numbers] node for each iteration.
 * 2. The child node being added is constructed with a value that is a reference to the currently iterated node, accessed via the `.dp/#` expression. This means the value of the new node is set to the value of the node currently being processed in the loop, by reference.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Collecting all even numbers from a list and storing them as children under [.even_numbers].
 * - Building a filtered subset of nodes based on a condition, where each matching node is added to a result collection.
 * - Aggregating nodes from an iteration into a single parent node for further processing or output.
