/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates over each child node of [.car-parts], and for every iteration, it provides the current node as a [.dp] reference.
 * 2. Inside the loop, [set-value] updates the value of the currently iterated node (referenced via [.dp]).
 * 3. The new value is constructed by [strings.concat], which merges the name of the node (using [get-name]) with the static string " is checked".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Marking each car part in [.car-parts] as "checked" for inspection reports.
 * - Dynamically updating a list of inventory items to show their status.
 * - Processing a list of nodes to append a verification label to each nodeâ€™s value.
 * - Preparing user-facing checklists where each item is noted as reviewed.
