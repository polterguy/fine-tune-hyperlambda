/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot changes the value of all nodes named [master] at the same level as the current node (due to the expression "@.master") to "template1".
 * 2. The [case] node named [pgsql] suggests this logic is part of a [switch] or [case] branching structure, and will only execute if the case matches "pgsql".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Setting the value of a [master] configuration node to "template1" when the PostgreSQL case is selected.
 * - Dynamically updating a database connection or schema name based on the selected database type.
 * - Ensuring that the [master] node reflects the correct template or database for PostgreSQL-specific operations.
