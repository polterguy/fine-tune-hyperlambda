/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@.databaseType`. This means it looks for the first node named [.databaseType] in the current context and returns its value.
 * 2. The `x:` syntax indicates that [get-value] is using an expression to locate the node, rather than a static path.
 * 3. This operation is commonly used to extract configuration or context-specific values for use in further processing.
 * 
 * Possible use cases:
 * - Fetching the current database type to determine which SQL dialect or connector to use.
 * - Passing the retrieved value as an argument to another slot that requires the database type.
 * - Using the value in a conditional statement to branch logic based on the database type.
 * - Logging the database type for debugging or auditing purposes.
