/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates over each child node of [.data], setting up a loop that processes [item1], [item2], and [item3] one by one.
 * 2. Inside the loop, the [set-value] slot updates the value of [.result] on each iteration.
 * 3. The [strings.concat] slot constructs a string by concatenating the current value of [.result], the value of the currently iterated node via [get-value:x:@.dp/#], and a comma with a space.
 * 4. The final value of [.result] becomes a comma-separated string of all the values from [.data]'s children, with an extra comma and space at the end.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Building a single delimited string from multiple configuration values.
 * - Aggregating a list of item names or identifiers for display or export.
 * - Preparing a comma-separated value for use in an SQL IN clause or similar contexts.
 * - Creating readable summaries of node values for logging or reporting.
