/*
 * 1. The [.user-preference] node is assigned a string value that appears to be a lambda expression. This expression is constructed dynamically and references nodes within the [.preferences] collection, targeting a user by their [userId] argument, and then navigating to that user's [theme] node.
 * 2. The expression utilizes curly braces and string interpolation to inject the value from [.arguments] with the name [userId] into the path, enabling lookup of a specific user's theme preference.
 * 3. The path `@.preferences/*/\"{@.arguments/*/userId}\"/*/theme` demonstrates advanced usage of Hyperlambda's expression syntax, combining node traversal with runtime value resolution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Storing a reference to a user's theme preference node for later value retrieval or manipulation.
 * - Dynamically constructing an expression to access theme settings for any user based on input arguments.
 * - Facilitating user-specific customization by targeting preferences in a scalable way.
 * - Enabling context-aware UI logic that depends on the user's stored theme.
