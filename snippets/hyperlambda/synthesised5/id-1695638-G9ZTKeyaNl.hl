/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks if its first argument evaluates to true and, if so, executes its [.lambda] child node as a code block.
 * 2. [not-exists] is used to verify that the expression `:x:@data.select/*` does not return any nodesâ€”meaning it tests for the absence of child nodes under [data.select].
 * 3. If [not-exists] returns true, the [.lambda] block is executed, which contains [remove-nodes].
 * 4. [remove-nodes] is called with an expression that targets all [snippets] nodes located as children of the [return] node, which itself is a sibling of the current node's parent.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Clean up or remove [snippets] nodes from the [return] node only if [data.select] has no children, ensuring output does not contain unnecessary snippets.
 * - In a data transformation pipeline, automatically remove code or documentation snippets if a data selection step produced no results.
 * - Useful in dynamic API responses to suppress optional sections if there is no data to display.
 * - Can be applied in code generation routines to exclude template segments when certain conditions are not met.
