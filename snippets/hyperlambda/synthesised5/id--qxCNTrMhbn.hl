/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.dest] node (referenced by the `-` iterator, meaning the previous sibling of [.dest]) with the result of the conversion.
 * 2. The [convert] slot takes the value of the [.data] node and attempts to convert it to the date type, as specified by its [type] child.
 * 3. The [type] node, as a child of [convert], instructs the conversion to interpret the value as a date.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Parsing a string date from input and storing it as a proper date type in the backend for further date operations.
 * - Ensuring that values originating from free text or untyped sources are properly typed before storage or validation.
 * - Preparing string-based date data for use in date comparisons, formatting, or calculations elsewhere in the code.
 * - Normalizing input data from different sources to a consistent date type for database persistence or API responses.
