/*
 * 1. The [type] slot is used to retrieve the Hyperlambda type name of a value or node.
 * 2. When invoked with a static value as its argument, such as [type:string], it returns the type name of the provided valueâ€”in this case, "string".
 * 3. This slot is useful for dynamically determining the type of a value at runtime, which can be helpful for validation, debugging, or conditional logic based on data types.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating that a user input or argument is of the expected type before processing.
 * - Debugging workflows by checking the type of dynamically generated or manipulated nodes.
 * - Implementing logic that branches or behaves differently depending on the type of a value.
