/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `@.fields`. This means it will return the value stored inside the [fields] node that is a sibling or child node relative to the current execution context.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.fields` uses the `@` iterator to locate the first [fields] node up the hierarchy from the current node.
 * 3. The returned result is the raw value of the [fields] node, and not any of its children or metadata.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting a user input value from a [fields] node for further processing.
 * - Passing the value of [fields] as an argument to another slot or function.
 * - Logging or displaying the content of [fields] for debugging or audit purposes.
