/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.sql`, which means it looks for the first ancestor node named [.sql] and returns its value.
 * 2. The expression used (`:x:@.sql`) utilizes the `@` iterator to navigate up the node hierarchy and find the nearest [.sql] node.
 * 3. This slot does not evaluate or execute the [.sql] node; it simply returns its current value as a result.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the generated SQL query string from a previously created [.sql] node for logging or debugging.
 * - Passing the SQL statement value as an argument to another slot or function.
 * - Displaying the SQL command generated in a user interface for inspection.
 * - Storing the returned SQL command in a variable for later reuse or modification.
