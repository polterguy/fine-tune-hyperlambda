/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot sets the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:-` (the previous sibling, which is [.trackerId]) to the result of its children.
 * 2. The [config.get] slot retrieves the configuration value for the key "integration:analytics:tracker-id" and returns it as the value.
 * 3. The [.trackerId] node acts as a placeholder that will receive the retrieved configuration value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically populating the [.trackerId] node with the analytics tracker ID from the application's configuration.
 * - Ensuring that configuration-driven values are injected into nodes for later use in analytics or telemetry code.
 * - Centralizing the retrieval of sensitive or environment-specific IDs to minimize hardcoding throughout Hyperlambda files.
