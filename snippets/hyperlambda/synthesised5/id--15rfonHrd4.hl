/*
 * 1. The [previous-sibling] slot uses the expression `:x:@.log/-` to find and return the previous sibling node of [.log]. 
 * 2. The `-` iterator retrieves the node that is located directly above [.log] at the same hierarchical level in the node graph.
 * 3. The resulting node is referenced by [previous-sibling], which can then be used for further processing or manipulation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Navigating to the node immediately before [.log] to read its value for comparison or validation.
 * - Inserting new nodes relative to the position of [.log] by first locating its previous sibling.
 * - Performing conditional logic based on the presence or value of the previous sibling node to [.log].
 * - Iterating through sibling nodes in reverse order for tasks like log analysis or custom sorting.
