/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`, which points to the first node named [.fields] in the current execution context.
 * 2. This slot does not return the node itself, but only its value, which could be any type (string, int, etc.) depending on how [.fields] is defined elsewhere in the execution tree.
 * 3. The value returned can be used as input for other slots, for conditional checks, or for passing values between different parts of your Hyperlambda code.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the value of [.fields] to include in an API response.
 * - Using the value of [.fields] as input for further processing, such as validation or transformation.
 * - Passing the value of [.fields] into another slot, such as for logging or mathematical operations.
