/*
 * 1. The [http.post] slot sends an HTTP POST request to the specified URL ("https://httpbin.org/post").  
 * 2. The [convert] node with a value of bool:true instructs the slot to automatically convert the response object to its appropriate type.  
 * 3. The [query] node defines query string parameters to be appended to the URL, including [some_query_param] with a static value and [another_query_param] whose value is dynamically resolved from the [query2] node.  
 * 4. The [payload] node specifies the body of the POST request, including a [category] value dynamically taken from the [category] node and a static [sort] value of "price_asc".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Submitting a filtered and sorted product search to an external API, where filter and sort criteria are dynamically determined.
 * - Sending a POST request with both query string and body parameters, with some values resolved at runtime from other nodes.
 * - Integrating with third-party REST APIs that require both URL and body parameters, and expecting a typed response.
