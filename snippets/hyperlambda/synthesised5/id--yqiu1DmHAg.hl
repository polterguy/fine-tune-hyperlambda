/*
 * 1. The [convert] slot is used to change the value of the previous node, referenced by the expression `:x:-`, into a different type as specified by its child node [type].
 * 2. The [type] node under [convert] is set to "int", which instructs [convert] to convert the value obtained from [.src] to an integer type.
 * 3. The use of `:x:-` means [convert] will operate on the node immediately above it in the execution tree, here being [.src].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Converting a string input from [.src] to an integer before performing mathematical operations.
 * - Normalizing data types in user input to ensure consistent downstream processing.
 * - Validating and converting data received from external sources to the expected numeric type.
