/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the node specified by the expression in its value argument.  
 * 2. The `:x:@.sql` expression points to a sibling or ancestor node named [.sql], and [get-value] will extract its value.  
 * 3. This is commonly used when you want to reference or utilize the contents of a node named [.sql] elsewhere in your workflow.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically accessing a SQL statement stored in a [.sql] node to pass it as a parameter to another slot.
 * - Fetching and logging the value of [.sql] for debugging or auditing purposes.
 * - Using the value from [.sql] as input for further processing, such as modifying or executing the SQL statement.
