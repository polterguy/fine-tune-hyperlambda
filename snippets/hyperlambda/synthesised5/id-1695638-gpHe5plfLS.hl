/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@.end`. The `@.end` part directs the slot to find the first node named [.end] in the current hierarchy and extract its value.
 * 
 * 2. This slot does not modify any data; it simply reads and returns the value associated with the referenced node.
 * 
 * 3. The result of this operation can be used as an input for other slots, passed as an argument, or compared in conditional logic elsewhere in the workflow.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the value of an [.end] node to display as output or as part of an API response.
 * - Using the value of [.end] as input for a mathematical or string operation.
 * - Passing the value of [.end] to another slot for further processing or validation.
