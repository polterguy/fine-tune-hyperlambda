/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to add nodes to a target node set. Here, it targets all [headers] nodes that are children of any [http.post] node within the current node's siblings (`:x:./*/http.post/*/headers`).
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the values of all children of the [.headers] node in the current context (`:x:@.headers/*`), and these values are added to the target [headers] nodes by the [add] slot.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Merging a set of HTTP headers defined in a [.headers] node into all [headers] collections of sibling [http.post] requests, allowing for centralized or reusable header definitions.
 * - Dynamically injecting authentication tokens or custom headers into multiple outgoing POST requests within a workflow.
 * - Applying a common set of headers (like content type or user agent) to several HTTP POST requests defined at the same scope, without duplicating header definitions.
