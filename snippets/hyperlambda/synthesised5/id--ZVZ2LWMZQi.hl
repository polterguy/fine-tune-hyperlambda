/*
 * 1. The [http.get] slot sends an HTTP GET request to "https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity" and, with [convert:true], automatically parses the JSON response into a lambda object structure.
 * 2. The [if] slot checks if the HTTP status code (the value of [http.get]) is greater than or equal to 200 and less than 300, indicating a successful response.
 * 3. If the condition is true, [set-value] assigns the value of the [activity] field from the parsed response to the [.activity] node by extracting it with [get-value].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching a random activity from the Bored API and storing the result in [.activity] for further use.
 * - Integrating external activity suggestions into a chatbot or application workflow.
 * - Automatically handling and validating API responses by checking the HTTP status code before using the data.
 * - Demonstrating how to parse API responses and safely transfer relevant fields to internal nodes for later processing.
