/*
 * 1. The [math.divide] slot divides multiple values sequentially, using the first child node as the base and each subsequent node as the next divisor.
 * 2. [get-value:x:@.dividend] retrieves the value of the [.dividend] node (24), and [get-value:x:@.divisor] retrieves the value of the [.divisor] node (4).
 * 3. The static value node [.:int:2] provides an additional divisor, so the operation performed is 24 divided by 4, then the result divided by 2, resulting in a final value of 3.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Calculating the result of dividing a number by two other numbers in sequence, such as for stepwise normalization.
 * - Dynamically fetching divisor values from other nodes for flexible mathematical operations.
 * - Performing chained division for scenarios like averaging or scaling down values.
