/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot is used to retrieve the value of a specific node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/limit` navigates to all [limit] nodes that are children of any node inside the [.arguments] node.
 * 3. When executed, this slot will return the value of the first [limit] node found within the [.arguments] structure.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Accessing a user-supplied [limit] argument in an HTTP endpoint to control pagination or the number of items returned.
 * - Fetching configuration values passed as arguments to a dynamic slot for further processing.
 * - Validating or using the [limit] parameter to ensure it is within acceptable bounds before executing data queries.
 * - Providing dynamic behavior in an endpoint based on optional input such as [limit] without hardcoding values.
