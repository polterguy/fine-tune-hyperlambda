/*
 * 1. [data.connect] establishes a connection to the database named [shopDB], which scopes all subsequent database operations within this connection.
 * 2. [data.update] performs an update operation on a database table, specified by its [table] child node.
 * 3. [table] specifies the target table for the update, in this case [orders].
 * 4. [values] lists the columns and their new values for the update; here, it sets the [status] column to "shipped".
 * 5. [where] restricts which records to update, using a logical [and] to combine conditions.
 * 6. [order_id.eq] is a condition within [where] that ensures only records where [order_id] equals 12345 are updated.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Marking a specific order as shipped in an online store after packaging is complete.
 * - Updating the status of a customerâ€™s order after successful delivery confirmation.
 * - Changing the status of a transaction in an order management system based on workflow progression.
 * - Automating shipment notifications by updating order records in a logistics database.
