/*
 * 1. The [.one] and [.two] nodes are initialized with integer values 7 and 11, respectively.
 * 2. The [math.add] slot sums the values of [.one] and [.two] by retrieving their values using [get-value] with the expressions `:x:@.one` and `:x:@.two`.
 * 3. The [math.multiply] slot takes two arguments: a static integer value 3, and the result of [math.add]. It multiplies 3 by the sum of [.one] and [.two], which is 18, resulting in the value 54.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Calculating a scaled sum, such as finding three times the combined total of two input numbers.
 * - Dynamically combining user inputs and applying a multiplication factor for scoring or ranking mechanisms.
 * - Performing multi-step mathematical operations in a single Hyperlambda expression, reducing the need for intermediate variables.
 * - Generating weighted results, for instance, in financial or statistical computations where sums are multiplied by coefficients.
