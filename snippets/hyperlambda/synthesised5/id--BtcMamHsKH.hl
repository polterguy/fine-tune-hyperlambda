/*
 * 1. The [.args] node is used to store input data, specifically two nodes named [foo1] and [foo2] with their respective values.
 * 2. The [execute-file] slot is invoked to execute an external Hyperlambda file located at "/whatever-file.hl". This slot will execute the file as if it was a dynamic slot, passing in arguments.
 * 3. The [arg1] and [arg2] nodes are passed as arguments to the executed file. Their values are set by evaluating the expressions `:x:@.args/*/foo1` and `:x:@.args/*/foo2`, meaning the values of [.args]'s [foo1] and [foo2] children are retrieved and provided as input.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Dynamically executing reusable Hyperlambda files with arguments mapped from existing data nodes.
 * - Passing selected values from a data payload into a modular Hyperlambda script for processing.
 * - Orchestrating workflows by extracting parameters from a compound node and invoking external logic files.
 * - Wrapping business logic in Hyperlambda files and calling them with data sourced from other nodes in the execution context.
