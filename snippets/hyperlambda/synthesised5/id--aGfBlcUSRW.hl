/*
 * 1. The [strings.trim-start] slot will remove all leading occurrences of the character(s) specified as its argument from the start of the string found in the value of the [strings.trim-start] node.
 * 2. In this example, the string "xxx" will be trimmed from the start for any 'x' characters, resulting in an empty string since all characters are 'x'.
 * 3. The first child node, with a value of "x", specifies which characters to trim from the beginning of the original string.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Cleaning up user input by removing unwanted characters from the start of a string.
 * - Preprocessing data fields that might have leading padding or formatting characters.
 * - Normalizing strings before comparison or storage by stripping specific characters from the left.
