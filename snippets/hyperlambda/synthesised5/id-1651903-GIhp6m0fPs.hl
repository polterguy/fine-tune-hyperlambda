/*
 * 1. The [lambda2hyper] slot converts a lambda object (node hierarchy) into a Hyperlambda string representation. The expression `:x:@.lambda/*` specifies that all child nodes of the [.lambda] node are to be serialized.
 * 2. The [comments] child node with a value of "true" instructs [lambda2hyper] to preserve any comments found in the lambda object, serializing them as Hyperlambda comments in the resulting string.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Serializing a dynamically constructed lambda object (including its comments) to a Hyperlambda string for storage or transmission.
 * - Exporting a lambda hierarchy to a readable Hyperlambda format while retaining developer comments for documentation purposes.
 * - Converting lambda objects with embedded comments to Hyperlambda text for version control or code review.
