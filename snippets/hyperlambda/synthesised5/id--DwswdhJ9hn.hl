/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot loops through each child node of [.products], passing each one by reference into [.dp] for use within the loop body.
 * 2. The [unwrap] slot evaluates all children nodes of the current product node, effectively flattening the structure and making their children available for further processing.
 * 3. The [add] slot appends a new child node to the currently iterated product node, where the new node contains a [category] child whose value is dynamically set to the value of [.category] (in this case, "Electronics").
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Enriching a list of product nodes by programmatically attaching category information to each product.
 * - Batch-assigning metadata (like category, tag, or status) to multiple records in a hierarchical data structure.
 * - Preparing product data for export, search, or further transformation by ensuring each product is associated with its relevant category before further processing.
 * - Updating an existing product catalog with additional classification, without modifying the original structure of each product node.
