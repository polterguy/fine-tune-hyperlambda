/*
 * 1. The [sql.read] slot is used to construct and execute a SQL query that reads data from a database.
 * 2. The [table] node specifies the main table to query from, which is [people] in this case.
 * 3. The [join] node under [table] initiates an inner join with the [salary] table, allowing related data from [salary] to be included in the results.
 * 4. The [type] node within [join] explicitly sets the join type to "inner", ensuring only matching records from both tables are returned.
 * 5. The [on] node contains an [and] condition which defines the join logic: the [people.id] column must match the [salary.people_id] column.
 * 6. The [columns] node lists the specific columns to be returned in the result set: [salary.monthly], [people.first_name], and [people.last_name].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving a list of people along with their monthly salary by joining person and salary tables.
 * - Creating a report that displays employee names and their corresponding salary amounts from two related tables.
 * - Filtering and selecting only those people who have salary records, thanks to the inner join.
 * - Preparing a dataset for payroll processing where both personal and financial data are needed.
