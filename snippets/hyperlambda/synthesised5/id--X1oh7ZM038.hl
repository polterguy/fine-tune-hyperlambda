/*
 * 1. The [add] slot appends nodes to a destination node or collection of nodes. Here, it targets all children of the [.ui] node as destinations using `:x:@.ui/*`.
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all children nodes of [.blocks] via `:x:@.blocks/*` and provides them as sources to [add].
 * 3. As a result, both [logo] and [nav] nodes from [.blocks] are appended as children to each node under [.ui] (i.e., both [header] and [footer]).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically inject shared navigation and branding into multiple UI sections.
 * - Populate layout templates with common content blocks in a content management system.
 * - Replicate reusable modules (like navigation or logos) across several UI components in a Hyperlambda-driven application.
 * - Efficiently compose page sections by merging blocks from a central registry into various layouts.
