/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used here to append nodes to the children of the nodes found by the expression `@data.connect/*/return/*/snippets`. This means all nodes matching [snippets] under any [return] node, under any child of [data.connect], will have new children added.
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot is invoked with the expression `@data.select/*`, which retrieves all child nodes of any [data.select] node in the current context.
 * 3. The result of [get-nodes] is used as input to [add], so all nodes returned from [get-nodes] are added as children to every [snippets] node found by the [add] expression.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically copy or aggregate all query snippets from [data.select] nodes into multiple [snippets] containers after a database operation.
 * - Merge results from various [data.select] operations into a central location for further processing or export.
 * - Dynamically populate code or template sections ([snippets]) with the results of select queries, supporting modular code generation.
 * - Useful in scenarios where you need to build up a collection of reusable query fragments based on runtime results.
