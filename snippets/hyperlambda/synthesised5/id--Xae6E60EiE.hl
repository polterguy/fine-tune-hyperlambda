/*
 * 1. The [format] slot is used to convert the value of the [.foo] node—specified as a decimal value (57)—into a string representation using a custom formatting pattern.
 * 2. The [pattern] argument "{0:0.00}" ensures that the number is formatted with two decimal places (e.g., "57,00").
 * 3. The [culture] argument is set to "nb-NO" (Norwegian Bokmål), which changes the decimal separator from a period to a comma, following Norwegian formatting conventions.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Displaying currency values in a user interface according to a specific locale.
 * - Preparing numbers for export to documents or systems that require regional formatting.
 * - Generating reports where numbers must be formatted according to a target audience's language and culture.
 * - Ensuring that decimal numbers are always shown with a consistent number of decimal places regardless of input.
 * - Supporting localization by dynamically formatting values based on user preferences.
