 * 1. The [set-value] slot is used here to update the value of all child nodes of [.data] to a new value.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.data/*` selects every direct child node of [.data], which in this context are [item1] and [item2].
 * 3. The child node of [set-value] with a name of [.] and a value of "Updated Value" provides the new value to assign to each selected node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Bulk updating the values of a list of items under a parent node, for example, marking all tasks as completed.
 * - Standardizing or resetting the values of multiple configuration options within a data structure.
 * - Applying a default or fallback value to every entry in a collection where the current value is not relevant.
