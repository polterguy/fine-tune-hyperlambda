/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot fetches the value of the node(s) referenced by the `:x:@.fields` expression.
 * 2. The expression `@.fields` locates the first node named [.fields] in the current hierarchy and retrieves its value.
 * 3. If multiple [.fields] nodes exist, only the first one found is used.
 * 4. This slot is useful for extracting the actual data content stored in a node, rather than the node itself.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving a user's submitted form fields from a [.fields] node for further processing.
 * - Passing the value of [.fields] as an argument to another operation or slot.
 * - Displaying the value of [.fields] in a UI after a data fetch.
 * - Using the [.fields] value as input for conditional logic elsewhere in the workflow.
