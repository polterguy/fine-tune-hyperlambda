/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to add together the values of its children nodes and/or the result of its expression. Here, it targets the [.result] node, so the sum will be assigned to [.result].
 * 2. The first child of [add] is a node with an expression `.`, which points to the current node context.
 * 3. The innermost node uses the `:x:@strings.split/0` expression, which retrieves the value of the first child node of [strings.split]. This is typically the first substring resulting from a previous [strings.split] operation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Summing the first element of a split string (e.g., extracting and adding a number from a space-separated string).
 * - Aggregating values from the result of a [strings.split] operation.
 * - Dynamically referencing and adding specific split results to an existing result node.
