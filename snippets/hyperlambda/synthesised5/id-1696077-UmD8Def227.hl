/*
 * 1. The [validators.enum] slot is used to enforce that the value of the [aggregate_column] argument under each node in [.arguments] matches one of a specific set of allowed values.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/aggregate_column` targets all [aggregate_column] nodes found within any child of [.arguments], validating each one.
 * 3. The allowed values for [aggregate_column] are explicitly listed as [.documents.document_id], [.documents.client_id], [.documents.title], [.documents.file_path], [.documents.uploaded_date], and [.client_id.name]. If any [aggregate_column] is set to a value not in this list, an exception will be thrown.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Ensuring an API endpoint only accepts aggregate column names that are known and supported, preventing invalid or unsafe SQL queries.
 * - Validating user input in forms where the user can select a column to aggregate on, restricting their choices to documented columns.
 * - Enforcing data integrity in dynamic report builders by making sure reports only reference pre-approved columns.
