/*
 * 1. The [validators.integer] slot is used to validate that the value(s) referenced by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/delay` are integers within a specified range.
 * 2. The [min] child node sets the minimum allowed value for the [delay] argument to 500.
 * 3. The [max] child node sets the maximum allowed value for the [delay] argument to 30,000.
 * 4. If any [delay] value in the referenced nodes is not an integer within the range 500 to 30,000 (inclusive), an exception will be thrown.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Ensuring that a user-supplied delay parameter in an API request is not set too low or too high, protecting against unreasonable or potentially harmful values.
 * - Validating input for a scheduling or timer feature to enforce acceptable delay intervals.
 * - Enforcing business rules where a process must wait at least 500 milliseconds but no longer than 30 seconds.
