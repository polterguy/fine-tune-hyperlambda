/*
 * 1. [mssql.connect] establishes a connection to the [crm] Microsoft SQL Server database, making all its child slots execute within the scope of this database connection.
 * 2. [mssql.update] performs an update operation on the [users] table, setting the [email] field to "new.email@example.com" for records matching the condition specified in the [where] clause.
 * 3. [values] specifies the column ([email]) to update and its new value.
 * 4. [where] ensures that only the record(s) where the [id] is equal to 42 will be updated, using the [id.eq] comparison.
 * 5. [yield] returns a success message with a [message] node set to "DONE!" after the update operation completes.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Updating a user's email address in the CRM system by user ID.
 * - Performing targeted updates to user details in a transactional workflow.
 * - Ensuring only a specific record is modified by using a safe parameterized WHERE clause.
 * - Returning a simple completion message after a database update for client-side confirmation.
