/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@http.post/*/content/*/user-id`. This expression navigates to the first [http.post] node, then to its [content] child, then to any of its children, and finally to a [user-id] node, returning the value of that [user-id] node.
 * 
 * 2. The expression allows for flexible navigation, supporting cases where [content] may have multiple children, and [user-id] could be nested within any of them.
 * 
 * 3. The result of this operation is the value of the [user-id] node found in the HTTP POST response's content.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting a user ID from the response of an HTTP POST request, for example after creating a new user via an API.
 * - Retrieving specific data from a complex API response where the [user-id] may be nested within other objects.
 * - Automating workflows that require using the returned user ID in subsequent operations, such as updating user details or assigning roles.
