/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node(s) referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. In this case, it looks for a node named [.fields] at the current scope and returns its value.
 * 
 * 2. The main slot used here is [get-value], which is commonly used to extract the value from a node identified by an expression, allowing subsequent operations to work with the retrieved data directly.
 * 
 * 3. Use cases:
 *    - Extracting the value from a [.fields] node to use as input for calculations or further processing.
 *    - Fetching the value of [.fields] to validate user input or check if a required field is present.
 *    - Returning the contents of [.fields] as part of an API response or logging its value for debugging purposes.
