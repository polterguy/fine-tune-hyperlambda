/*
 * 1. The [lambda2hyper] slot is used to convert a lambda object structure, specifically all child nodes of the [.foo] node (`:x:@.foo/*`), into its Hyperlambda (textual) representation.
 * 2. The [comments] argument with a value of true instructs [lambda2hyper] to include any semantic comment nodes (i.e., [..] nodes representing comments) in the generated Hyperlambda text, preserving documentation or explanations embedded in the lambda structure.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Serializing a dynamically constructed lambda object (including comments) for storage or transmission to another service.
 * - Exporting a section of an in-memory node tree (such as all children under [.foo]) as readable Hyperlambda source code, including embedded developer comments.
 * - Creating backups of parts of a graph object with full documentation for future re-import or sharing with team members.
 * - Generating Hyperlambda code from programmatically created node structures, ensuring that any associated comments/documentation are not lost during the process.
