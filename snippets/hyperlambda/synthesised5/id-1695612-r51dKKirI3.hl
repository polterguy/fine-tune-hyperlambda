/*
 * 1. The [get-first-value] slot is used here to return the first non-null value from its children.
 * 2. The first child, [get-value], fetches the value from the node at the path `@http.post/*/content/*/choices/0/*/message/*/content`.
 * 3. The second child is an empty value node ([.]), which acts as a fallback default if the value from [get-value] is null.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Safely extract a single response from an OpenAI API call, returning nothing if no content is found.
 * - Provide a default value in a data processing workflow if a required property is missing.
 * - Aggregate results from multiple potential data sources, returning the first available value.
 * - Implement fallback logic in HTTP response handling to prevent errors from missing keys.
