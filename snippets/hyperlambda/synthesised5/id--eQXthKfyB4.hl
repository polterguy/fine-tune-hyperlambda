/*
 * 1. The [.src] node is created with a value of "foo/bar".
 * 2. The [convert] slot is used to convert the value of the previous node (referenced by the - expression, which points to [.src]) to the type specified by its [type] child argument.
 * 3. The [type] node is set to "x", which in Hyperlambda refers to an expression type (magic.node.extensions.Expression), so the value "foo/bar" will be interpreted as a lambda expression after conversion.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically convert a string stored in [.src] into an executable expression for further processing.
 * - Prepare a value for use in later slots that require a lambda expression type instead of a string.
 * - Transform user input or configuration strings into expressions that can be evaluated elsewhere in the workflow.
 * - Support scenarios where you need to programmatically convert path-like or code-like strings into Hyperlambda expressions.
