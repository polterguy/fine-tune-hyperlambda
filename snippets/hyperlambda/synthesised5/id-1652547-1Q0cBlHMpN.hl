/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return data from a dynamic slot or endpoint. In this case, it returns a node named [orders].
 * 2. The value of [orders] is set using an expression `:x:@http.get/*/content/*`, which retrieves all child nodes of [content] nodes that are themselves children of [http.get] nodes. This means it collects all order-related data found under [content] nodes within the [http.get] response.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a list of orders fetched from an external HTTP API, where the HTTP response is structured with order data under [content].
 * - Exposing an endpoint that aggregates and returns order information from multiple HTTP GET requests.
 * - Serving as the final step in a workflow that processes HTTP responses and extracts relevant order data for the client.
