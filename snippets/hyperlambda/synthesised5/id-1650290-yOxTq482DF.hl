/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to append nodes to a target node set. Here, it targets the `:x:./*/http.post/*/payload/*/properties` expression, which means it will add nodes to the [properties] node found under [payload], which is itself under [http.post] in the current execution tree.
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all nodes under the [.arguments] node using the `:x:@.arguments/*` expression. This collects all argument nodes passed to the endpoint.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically inject all incoming arguments as properties into the payload of an outgoing HTTP POST request.
 * - Forward user-supplied parameters from an API endpoint into a downstream service call by copying them into the request body.
 * - Aggregate and transfer all validated input arguments into a nested properties object for further processing or logging.
