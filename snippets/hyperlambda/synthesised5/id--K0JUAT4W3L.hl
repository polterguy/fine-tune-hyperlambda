/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.res] node.
 * 2. It assigns the result of [io.file.load] as the new value for [.res].
 * 3. [io.file.load] reads the content of the file located at "/README.md" as text and returns this content.
 * 4. The lambda expression `:x:@.res` targets the [.res] node specifically for value assignment.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving and storing the content of a README file from disk into a node for later processing or display.
 * - Loading documentation or text resources dynamically as part of an HTTP endpoint response.
 * - Preloading configuration or instructional text from a file into memory for further analysis or manipulation in subsequent logic.
