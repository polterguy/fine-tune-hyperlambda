/*
 * 1. The [strings.ends-with] slot checks whether the value of the node (in this case, "HelloWorld") ends with the string provided as its child node (here, "Universe").
 * 2. Since "HelloWorld" does not end with "Universe", [strings.ends-with] will return false.
 * 3. This slot is useful for string pattern validation, such as verifying file extensions or ensuring that a text ends with a specific suffix.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validate that a filename ends with ".txt" before processing it.
 * - Check if a user's input ends with a required domain, like "@company.com".
 * - Ensure a log message concludes with a specific keyword for filtering.
 * - Confirm that a URL ends with a trailing slash before appending more segments.
