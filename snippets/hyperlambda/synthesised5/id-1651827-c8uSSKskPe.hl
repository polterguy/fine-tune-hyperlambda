/*
 * 1. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple conditions, and will only evaluate to true if all its child conditions are true.
 * 2. The first [not] slot negates the result of [strings.starts-with], which checks if the value of [.url] inside [.arguments] starts with "http://". This means the condition is true if [.url] does NOT start with "http://".
 * 3. The second [not] slot negates another [strings.starts-with], which checks if the value of [.url] inside [.arguments] starts with "https://". This means the condition is true if [.url] does NOT start with "https://".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To validate that a given URL does not start with either "http://" or "https://".
 * - To enforce that only non-HTTP(S) URLs are accepted, such as custom protocols or relative paths.
 * - To trigger specific logic or validation errors when a URL does not use the HTTP or HTTPS scheme.
