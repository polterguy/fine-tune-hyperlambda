/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a connection to the [ecommerce_db] database, with the [database-type] set to MSSQL, specifying that this is a Microsoft SQL Server database.
 * 2. Inside this connection, the [data.read] slot is used to read from the database, also explicitly declaring the [database-type] as MSSQL for clarity or enforcement.
 * 3. The [table] argument specifies that the query operates on the [orders] table.
 * 4. The [columns] node contains an aggregate function, [count(*)], and assigns its result the alias "count" using the [as] child node, meaning the query will return the total number of records in the [orders] table, labeled as "count".
 * 5. The [limit] argument is set to a long integer value of 1, restricting the result set to a single record, which makes sense for aggregate queries to avoid multiple rows.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - To fetch the total number of orders in the [orders] table for dashboard statistics.
 * - When validating if the [orders] table contains any entries before performing batch operations.
 * - For reporting purposes, when displaying the count of orders in an admin interface.
 * - As part of a scheduled job to monitor order table growth over time.
