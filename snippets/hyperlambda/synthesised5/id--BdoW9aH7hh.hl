/*
 * 1. The [io.folder.move] slot is used to move a folder from one location to another. In this code, it moves the folder located at `/documents/source/` to `/documents/destination/`.
 * 2. The child node [.] specifies the destination path for the move operation, which in this case is `/documents/destination/`.
 * 3. This operation will remove the original folder from `/documents/source/` and place all its contents under `/documents/destination/`. If the destination folder already exists, the behavior depends on the implementationâ€”typically, it may throw an error or overwrite, so caution is advised.
 * 4. All files and subfolders within the source folder are included in the move, preserving the folder structure.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Renaming or reorganizing folders within a document management system.
 * - Archiving old project folders by moving them to a separate archive directory.
 * - Cleaning up user directories by relocating completed work to a different location.
 * - Bulk-moving content as part of an automated workflow for data migration.
