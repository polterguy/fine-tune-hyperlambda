/*
 * 1. The [strings.ends-with] slot checks if the string provided as its value ends with the sequence of characters specified in its child node.
 * 2. In this example, [strings.ends-with] is given the string "Hello" and a child node with the value "LLO".
 * 3. The comparison is case-sensitive, so it will evaluate whether "Hello" ends exactly with "LLO" (which it does not, since "Hello" ends with "llo").
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Verifying if a filename ends with a specific extension, such as ".txt".
 * - Implementing case-sensitive validation for user input patterns.
 * - Filtering strings that must have a particular suffix as part of a workflow.
