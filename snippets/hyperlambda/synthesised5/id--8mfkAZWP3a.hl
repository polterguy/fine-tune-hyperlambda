/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a connection to the database named [shopDB], setting the context for the following database operations.
 * 2. The [data.scalar] slot executes the SQL statement `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders` against the connected database, returning a single scalar value representing the total number of rows in the [orders] table as the value of the [data.scalar] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the total number of orders to display on an admin dashboard.
 * - Quickly checking if the [orders] table contains any data before performing further operations.
 * - Generating metrics or statistics for reporting the size of the [orders] dataset.
 * - Performing logic that depends on whether there are more than a certain number of orders in the system.
