/*
 * 1. The [switch] slot compares the value of [.payment_method] to each [case] node's value and executes the children of the first matching [case].
 * 2. Each [case] node represents a possible payment method and, if matched, sets the value of [.result] to a corresponding string using [set-value].
 * 3. If none of the [case] values match [.payment_method], the [default] node is executed, assigning "Unknown payment method" to [.result].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically updating transaction status messages based on the selected payment method in an e-commerce checkout flow.
 * - Handling various user-selected payment options and providing tailored confirmation responses.
 * - Gracefully managing unexpected or unsupported payment types by defaulting to a generic message.
 * - Easily extending to support new payment methods by adding more [case] nodes.
