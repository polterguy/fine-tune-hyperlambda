/*
 * 1. The [data.select] slot runs a raw SQL query to select the [id] column from the [ml_permalinks] table, filtering on rows where the [messages] column matches a value provided by the [@messages] argument, and limits the result set to one record.
 * 2. The [@messages] argument uses an expression `:x:@cache.get` to dynamically retrieve the value of [@cache.get] and inject it into the SQL query as the value for the [messages] filter condition.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the permalink ID for a previously cached message, for example to check if a permalink already exists for a given message payload.
 * - Implementing a lookup where the messages value can change dynamically, such as referencing different message contents stored in cache.
 * - Performing efficient, single-record lookups in a table by leveraging indexed searches based on a runtime value.
 * - Reducing roundtrips by using cached data as SQL parameters instead of retrieving or recomputing values elsewhere.
