/*
 * 1. The [http.post] slot sends an HTTP POST request to the specified URL, in this case "https://some-url.com".
 * 2. The [token] node provides a JWT Bearer token that will be included in the HTTP Authorization header for authentication.
 * 3. The [payload] node supplies the data to be sent in the body of the POST request, which is typically a JSON object.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Submitting form data to a web API that requires authentication using a JWT token.
 * - Posting new records to a RESTful service where the payload must be protected via a Bearer token.
 * - Integrating with third-party APIs that require a secure POST request with a custom payload and authorization.
