/*
 * 1. The [math.multiply] slot multiplies its children nodes, in this case multiplying 5 by the result of another operation.
 * 2. The inner [math.add] slot adds its two children nodes, 1 and 2, resulting in 3.
 * 3. The combination means [math.multiply] will evaluate as 5 * 3, producing a final value of 15.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Calculating the product of a constant and a computed sum in one step.
 * - Performing nested math operations where intermediate results feed into higher-level calculations.
 * - Dynamically building mathematical expressions by combining slot invocations.
