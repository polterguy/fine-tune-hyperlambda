/*
 * 1. The [set-name] slot changes the name of each node referenced by the expression `@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column` to a new name, which is supplied by the value returned from [get-value].
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [group_column] node located under [.arguments], making this value the new name to assign to the matched nodes.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically rename all [group_column] nodes in a [group] section to match a user-supplied column name, ensuring column references are consistent for further SQL generation.
 * - When building a lambda that needs to apply grouping based on runtime input, this pattern updates internal node names to reflect the current group by parameters.
 * - Useful in scenarios where group by columns may be determined by API consumers or higher-level logic, and these values need to propagate into the SQL abstraction layer.
 * - Can assist in refactoring or normalizing input structures before constructing or executing SQL queries.
