/*
 * 1. The [set-name] slot is used to rename all nodes referenced by the expression `:x:@.foo/*`. In this case, it targets all child nodes of [.foo].
 * 2. The single child node of [set-name] provides the new name, in this case [.], which contains the string "new-name". 
 * 3. As a result, any child node under [.foo] (such as [old-name]) will have its name changed to [new-name], while preserving its value and children.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Standardizing node names in a data structure by renaming all children of a given parent node.
 * - Refactoring configuration or data graphs where certain node names need to be updated in bulk.
 * - Preparing a dataset for export or further processing where specific naming conventions are required.
