/*
 * 1. The [not] slot inverts the boolean result of its child condition, so it will return true if the inner condition is false, and vice versa.
 * 2. The [strings.starts-with] slot checks if the value of the node at the path `@csv2lambda/0/0` begins with "http://". If it does, the slot returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
 * 3. The overall effect is that the code checks if the value at [csv2lambda]/0/0 does NOT start with "http://". If it does not start with this prefix, the result is true; otherwise, it is false.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that imported CSV data does not contain URLs in a specific field.
 * - Validating that a string does not begin with an undesired protocol prefix.
 * - Implementing input sanitization to prevent certain URL formats in user data.
 * - Filtering rows where a field should not be a web address.
