/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to publish a SignalR event named "northwind.Categories.put" to all subscribers of this method. This allows real-time communication between the server and connected clients.
 * 2. The [args] node is included as a child of [sockets.signal], but it is empty, meaning no additional arguments or data are being sent with the signal.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Notifying all connected clients that a category in the Northwind database has been updated, so they can refresh their data.
 * - Broadcasting a generic "put" event for Northwind categories to trigger UI updates or cache invalidation on clients.
 * - Integrating with other systems or microservices that listen for category changes and need to react in real time.
