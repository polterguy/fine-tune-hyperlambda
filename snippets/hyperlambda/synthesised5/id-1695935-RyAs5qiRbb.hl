/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to read data from the specified table, in this case [Categories], from a SQLite database, as defined by [database-type].
 * 2. The [columns] node specifies which columns to retrieve. Here, [aggregate_functor] is selected and aliased as [result] using the [as] node, which means the result set will have a column named "result" that contains the output of the aggregate function.
 * 3. The [where] node with an [and] child is included, but since it has no conditions, it does not filter the results, effectively allowing all rows.
 * 4. The [group] node groups the query results by the [group_column], generating aggregated results (such as sums, counts, etc.) per unique [group_column] value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Generating reports that show aggregated statistics (like sum, count, average) of records in [Categories] grouped by a specific column.
 * - Creating dashboards that display summary metrics per category in a SQLite database.
 * - Extracting unique groups and their corresponding aggregate values for further analysis.
 * - Supporting endpoints or features that require grouped data with dynamic aggregation in business applications.
