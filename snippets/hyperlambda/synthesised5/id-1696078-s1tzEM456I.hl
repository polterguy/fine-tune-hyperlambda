/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates a sequence of string values into a single string, using as input the nodes referenced by the `:x:@.sql` expression. This means it will gather all child nodes of [.sql] to form the initial part of the output string.
 * 2. The [get-value] slot is used twice: first, to retrieve the value from the [.sql] node (effectively reusing the current SQL string), and second, to fetch the value from the [.fields] node (likely representing a field or column name in the SQL context). These insert dynamic values into the concatenated string.
 * 3. The static string nodes [.":) * 1.0 / length("] and [".:) as keyword_density, ("] are inserted as literal segments of the resulting string, which appear to build a SQL snippet that calculates the keyword density by dividing the count of something by the length of a field, and then labels this calculation as "keyword_density".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Constructing a dynamic SQL SELECT clause that includes a calculated "keyword_density" column on the fly.
 * - Generating SQL queries where part of the query is based on previously built or stored SQL fragments found in [.sql].
 * - Automatically creating SQL expressions for analytics or reporting features where "density" or ratio metrics are computed from field values.
 * - Assembling advanced SQL statements in low-code environments by combining dynamic and static string segments.
