/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression. In this case, the expression `@.sql` points to the first node named [.sql] that exists before the [get-value] node in the execution tree.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.sql` uses the @ iterator to look for a sibling or ancestor node named [.sql], and passes its value to [get-value].
 * 3. The result of this operation will be the value stored in the [.sql] node, which can be used in further processing or returned as output.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Extracting the SQL statement or script contained in a [.sql] node for execution or logging.
 * - Dynamically referencing the value of [.sql] in various parts of a workflow, such as for debugging or validation.
 * - Passing the SQL string from [.sql] into another slot that requires the actual SQL statement as input.
 * - Returning the value of [.sql] from an API endpoint or dynamic slot as part of a response.
