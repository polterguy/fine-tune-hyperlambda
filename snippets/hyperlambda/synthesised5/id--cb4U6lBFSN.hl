/*
 * 1. The [.name] node will be assigned the name of the first child node named [name] under the [.arguments] node, if such a node exists.
 * 2. The [get-name] slot is used here with the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/name`, which means it retrieves the name of the [name] node found inside [.arguments].
 * 3. This pattern is useful for extracting or verifying the node name of an argument passed into a Hyperlambda endpoint, possibly for dynamic processing logic based on input structure.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically logging or auditing what argument names were received in an HTTP endpoint.
 * - Implementing generic validation or transformation routines that depend on argument names.
 * - Building metadata-driven APIs where incoming argument names dictate branching behavior.
 * - Auto-generating documentation or UI elements based on provided argument names.
