/*
 * 1. The [whitelist] slot is used to restrict which slots can be executed within its enclosed [.lambda] block, providing a secure sandbox for running potentially untrusted code.
 * 2. The [.lambda] node defines a code segment that will be executed within the [whitelist] context, ensuring that only the explicitly whitelisted slots are available during its execution.
 * 3. Inside the [.lambda], the [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.foo] node to "foo", demonstrating the effect of whitelisting [set-value] as an allowed operation.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Safely executing third-party Hyperlambda snippets with limited permissions to mitigate security risks.
 * - Creating restricted scripting environments for end-users where only specific operations are permitted.
 * - Testing the impact of limiting slot availability on a given section of business logic.
 * - Enforcing strict controls during dynamic slot execution to prevent unauthorized actions.
