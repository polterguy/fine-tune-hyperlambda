/*
 * 1. The [strings.split] slot splits the value of its parent node by the sequence of characters provided as its first child node. Here, it takes the string "one,,two" and splits it using the comma (,) as the delimiter.
 * 2. Each resulting substring becomes a new child node under the [strings.split] node. In this case, the split operation results in three substrings: "one", "", and "two", since there are two consecutive commas producing an empty string between them.
 * 3. The slot removes the delimiter characters (commas) from the final output, ensuring only the split segments remain as separate nodes.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Parsing CSV data where empty fields should be preserved as empty nodes.
 * - Splitting a list of items from user input into individual nodes for further processing.
 * - Breaking apart a delimited configuration string into separate parameters for application logic.
 * - Normalizing data where separators may appear consecutively, resulting in intentional empty nodes.
