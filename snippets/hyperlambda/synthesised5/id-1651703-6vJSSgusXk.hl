/*
 * 1. The [add] slot adds together the values of its child nodes and any value referenced by its expression. In this case, it will sum the results of its children.
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all child nodes of the node named [hyper2lambda] by using the expression `:x:@hyper2lambda/*`, which returns all direct children of [hyper2lambda].
 * 3. The [add] slot then adds together the values of all nodes returned by [get-nodes].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Summing all numeric values produced as children of a [hyper2lambda] node after converting Hyperlambda text to a lambda object.
 * - Aggregating results from dynamically generated nodes after parsing Hyperlambda code.
 * - Calculating totals from a set of values extracted from a parsed Hyperlambda structure.
