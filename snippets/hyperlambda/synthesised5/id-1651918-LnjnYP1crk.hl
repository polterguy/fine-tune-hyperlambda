/*
 * 1. [add] is used with the expression `:x:@mysql.connect/*/return-nodes` to append new nodes to each node returned by the expression. This means for each node resulting from `@mysql.connect/*/return-nodes`, the children defined under [.] will be added as new children.
 * 2. The first child [.] is a container node grouping the nodes to be added.
 * 3. Inside this container, another [.] node is created, which itself contains:
 *    - [name] is set using the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/Key_name`, which retrieves the value of the [Key_name] node from the current data pointer (the node being iterated over).
 *    - [columns] is an empty node, likely intended to be populated later or used as a placeholder for additional data.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Transforming the result set of a MySQL connection by appending additional metadata or computed nodes to each result.
 * - Normalizing or restructuring database query results for further processing, such as grouping key names and preparing a placeholder for related columns.
 * - Preparing a data structure for serialization or further manipulation, such as building a list of index names and their associated columns from a MySQL schema query.
