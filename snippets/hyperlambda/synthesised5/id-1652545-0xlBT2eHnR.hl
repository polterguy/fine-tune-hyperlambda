/*
 * 1. The [add] slot appends nodes to the collection of children of the node(s) referenced by the expression `:x:@.artists`.
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves the node(s) referenced by the expression `:x:@.dp/#`, which is typically a reference node passed in by a [for-each] or similar construct.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Adding a set of nodes dynamically to the [artists] collection during iteration over another collection.
 * - Merging nodes from multiple sources into the [artists] node.
 * - Building up the [artists] node by including nodes from different parts of the execution tree.
