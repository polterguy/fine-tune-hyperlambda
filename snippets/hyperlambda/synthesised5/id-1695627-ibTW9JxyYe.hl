/*
 * 1. The [or] slot is used to evaluate to true if at least one of its child conditions is true.
 * 2. The first condition uses [mt] to check if the count of child nodes under [csv2lambda]/0 is greater than 1, indicating multiple rows or entries in the CSV conversion.
 * 3. The second condition uses [and] to combine two [not] and [strings.starts-with] slots, verifying that the value under [csv2lambda]/0/0 does not start with "http://" or "https://", effectively ensuring the data is not a URL.
 * 4. [strings.starts-with] checks if a string begins with a specified substring, and [not] inverts the result, confirming the absence of given prefixes.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Determine if the imported CSV data contains multiple records or if a single value is not a URL.
 * - Filter out rows where the first field should not be a web address.
 * - Apply different processing logic based on whether the CSV conversion produced multiple entries or a single non-URL string.
 * - Validate input before attempting to process or display CSV data, ensuring data integrity.
