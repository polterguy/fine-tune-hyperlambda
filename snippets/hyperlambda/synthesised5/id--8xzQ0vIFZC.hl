/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.first-value] node.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.data/2` is used to reference the third child node of [.data], which in this case is [gamma].
 * 3. The value assigned to [.first-value] becomes the value of the [gamma] node, which is "Sasha".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving and storing the value of a specific indexed child node from a collection.
 * - Extracting a preferred or default value from a list of possible options.
 * - Assigning a user or item from a collection to a primary variable for further processing.
 * - Mapping data from one part of the node structure to another by index rather than by name.
