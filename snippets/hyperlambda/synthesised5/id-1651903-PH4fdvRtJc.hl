/*
 * 1. The [signal] slot is used to invoke another slot, in this case [magic.modules.ensure-database], which is responsible for ensuring that a specific database exists for a given module.
 * 2. The [module] node specifies the name of the module for which the database should be checked or created.
 * 3. The [database] node specifies the name of the database that should be ensured for the module.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically creating or verifying the existence of a module-specific database during module installation or startup.
 * - Running database migration scripts if the database does not exist or needs to be updated for a module.
 * - Ensuring that all required databases for different modules are present before running integration or unit tests.
