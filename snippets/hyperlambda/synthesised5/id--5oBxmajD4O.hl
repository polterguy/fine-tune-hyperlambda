/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a database connection to the database named "sakila".
 * 2. The [data.select] slot executes the provided raw SQL query `SELECT title, release_year FROM film LIMIT 3` against the connected "sakila" database, retrieving the "title" and "release_year" columns from the "film" table, limited to the first 3 records.
 * 3. The results are returned as a Hyperlambda node structure, where each record is represented as a child node under [data.select], with [title] and [release_year] as sub-nodes containing the respective values.
 * 
 * Example use cases:
 * - Quickly previewing a small sample of movies and their release years from the "sakila" film database.
 * - Testing SQL queries against a MySQL database and viewing the structured result in Hyperlambda format.
 * - Generating a snippet to fetch and display a list of recent films in a dashboard or API response.
