/*
 * 1. The [not-exists] slot checks whether the expression `@.result/*/"={@strings.split/0}"` yields zero nodes. If no nodes are found by this expression, [not-exists] will return true; otherwise, it will return false.
 * 2. The expression uses a combination of lambda expression syntax and extrapolated expressions (`{@strings.split/0}`), which means it dynamically constructs the node name to look for among the children of [result]. It will only yield a node if a child of [result] has a name equal to the value of the first child of [strings.split].
 * 3. This logic is useful for verifying the absence of a dynamically named node within the children of [result], based on the output of [strings.split].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To ensure that a specific dynamically determined node does not exist before proceeding with further processing.
 * - To implement validation logic that requires certain nodes to be absent in a result set.
 * - To prevent duplicate or conflicting nodes from being created when processing user input or data transformations.
