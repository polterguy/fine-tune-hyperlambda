/*
 * 1. The [convert] slot is used to transform the value of the [.str] node from its original type (string) to a new type specified by the [type] argument.
 * 2. The [type] child node is set to "int", instructing [convert] to attempt converting the value of [.str] ("42") into an integer.
 * 3. The expression `:x:@.str` ensures that the value being converted is taken from the [.str] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Parsing user input from a string to an integer before performing calculations.
 * - Converting configuration values read as strings into their appropriate types for validation or further processing.
 * - Preparing data for insertion into a database column that expects a numeric type.
 * - Validating that a string value can be safely interpreted as an integer, throwing an error if not.
