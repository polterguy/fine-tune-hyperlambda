/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to read data from a database, in this case specifying the use of SQLite as the database type with the [database-type] argument.
 * 2. The [table] node specifies that the query will select data from the [categories] table.
 * 3. The [columns] node lists the specific columns to be retrieved from the [categories] table: [categories.id], [categories.name], and [categories.description].
 * 4. The [where] node, combined with the [and] node, sets up the structure for adding one or more filtering conditions to the query, although no specific conditions are provided in this snippet.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve a list of all categories from a SQLite database, including their IDs, names, and descriptions.
 * - Prepare a query structure where additional filtering conditions can be dynamically added to the [where] clause.
 * - Use as a template for building more complex queries involving the [categories] table, such as filtering by name or description.
