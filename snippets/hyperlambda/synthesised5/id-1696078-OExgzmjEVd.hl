/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot is used here to delete all nodes named [keyword_density] that are children of any child node of any node under [data.select].
 * 2. The expression `:x:@data.select/*/*/keyword_density` navigates from the [data.select] node, through its children, then through their children, and targets all nodes named [keyword_density] found at this third level.
 * 3. All matching [keyword_density] nodes are removed from the underlying data structure, but no other nodes are affected.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up the result set by removing temporary or unnecessary [keyword_density] data before further processing or export.
 * - Stripping out sensitive or redundant keyword analysis results before sharing the data with external consumers.
 * - Dynamically managing and pruning a large dataset to prepare it for reporting or visualization steps.
