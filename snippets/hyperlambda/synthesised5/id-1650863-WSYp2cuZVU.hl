/*
 * 1. The [http.post] slot sends an HTTP POST request to the URL "https://api.example.com/auth/login".
 * 2. The [headers] node allows you to specify custom HTTP headers for the request, such as content type or authorization, though in this snippet it is empty and would need to be populated as needed.
 * 3. The [payload] node is required and should contain the data to be sent in the body of the POST request, such as login credentials in JSON format.
 * 4. The [convert:true] node instructs the slot to automatically parse and convert the response object from the endpoint into the appropriate data type, rather than returning it as raw text.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Authenticating a user by sending their credentials to a login endpoint and receiving a parsed response, such as a JWT token.
 * - Integrating with third-party APIs that require POST requests with custom headers and payloads.
 * - Automating login flows in backend processes where the response needs to be consumed as structured data.
