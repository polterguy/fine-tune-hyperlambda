/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a database connection to the [auth_db] database, specifying the database type as MySQL via the [database-type] node.
 * 2. The [data.read] slot performs a read operation on the connected database, again explicitly declaring the database type as MySQL.
 * 3. The [table] node defines that the operation targets the [users] table.
 * 4. The [columns] node includes a [count(*)] aggregate function, which is aliased as [count] using the [as] node, instructing the SQL generator to count the total number of records in the [users] table.
 * 5. The [limit] node restricts the query to a single result, ensuring the output contains only one row with the aggregate count.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Determining the total number of users registered in the [users] table.
 * - Displaying user statistics or analytics dashboards that require user counts.
 * - Performing a quick health check to verify the existence and accessibility of the [users] table and its records.
 * - Implementing access control or licensing checks by counting the number of user accounts in the authentication database.
