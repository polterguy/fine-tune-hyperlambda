/*
 * 1. The [mail.smtp.send] slot is used to send one or more emails through an SMTP server. It manages connection, authentication, and message dispatching.
 * 2. The [message] node defines the email to be sent, including sender ([from]), recipient(s) ([to]), subject, and content structure.
 * 3. The [to] and [from] nodes use sub-nodes with [name] and [email] to specify the recipient and sender details, supporting dynamic construction or unwrapping of contact information.
 * 4. The [entity] node specifies the MIME content type ("text/plain" in this case), with the [content] node holding the body of the email.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Sending a plain text email from a custom sender to a specific recipient.
 * - Automating email notifications from a system account with a dynamic subject and body.
 * - Integrating email delivery into workflows where sender and recipient details are programmatically generated or retrieved.
 * - Supporting personalized communications in applications by assembling [name] and [email] fields from user data.
