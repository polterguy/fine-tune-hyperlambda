/*
 * 1. The [.uAmount] node is declared with the type unsigned integer (uint) and assigned a value of 1000.
 * 2. Typing the node as uint ensures only non-negative whole numbers can be stored in [.uAmount], and can help prevent accidental usage of negative values.
 * 3. The use of the "." prefix indicates this node is intended as a data segment, which means it will not be executed as a slot but treated as pure data.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Storing a user's account balance in a safe, non-negative format.
 * - Representing the number of items in inventory where negative counts are not allowed.
 * - Passing [.uAmount] as an argument to math slots (such as [math.add], [math.subtract], etc.) to perform calculations.
