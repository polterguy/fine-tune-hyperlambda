/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return a value from a dynamic slot or endpoint. It outputs the result to the caller.
 * 2. The [metadata] node is created and its value is set to the result of the expression `:x:@json2lambda/*`, which means it will contain all child nodes of the [json2lambda] node.
 * 3. The `:x:@json2lambda/*` expression retrieves all children of the [json2lambda] node, effectively passing the parsed lambda structure (converted from JSON) as the value of [metadata].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a lambda object parsed from JSON as part of an HTTP API response.
 * - Wrapping the result of a JSON-to-lambda conversion in a [metadata] node for further processing or for standardized output.
 * - Providing structured metadata to a client or another process after converting JSON input to a lambda object.
