 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of all nodes referenced by the `:x:@.fields` expression.  
 * 2. The [strings.join] slot concatenates the values of all child nodes under [.fields], inserting " || " as a separator between them.
 * 3. The joined string from [strings.join] is set as the new value for each [.fields] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Combine a list of field names or expressions separated by " || " for SQL queries.
 * - Convert an array of keywords into a single string with custom separators.
 * - Prepare data for display where multiple values need merging into a readable format.
