/*
 * 1. The [eq] slot compares two arguments to check if they are exactly equal.
 * 2. The first argument uses [type] with the expression `:x:@.dp/#` to get the type name of the node referenced by [.dp]. This returns the Hyperlambda type of that referenced node.
 * 3. The second argument is the static value "x", which represents the Expression type in Hyperlambda.
 * 4. The result of [eq] will be true only if the type of the node referenced by [.dp] is "x"; otherwise, it will be false.
 * 
 * Typical use cases:
 * - Filtering or branching logic to handle only nodes of a specific type (e.g., expression nodes).
 * - Validation in a [for-each] loop to process nodes differently based on their type.
 * - Asserting the type of a node before performing type-specific operations.
