/*
 * 1. The [http.get] slot performs an HTTP GET request to the URL "https://api.example.com/orders".
 * 2. The [query] child node adds a query string parameter to the request, setting "customerId" to the value found at the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/CustomerId`.
 * 3. The [convert] node with a boolean value of true instructs the slot to automatically convert the HTTP response content into a lambda object, if a suitable conversion function is registered for the response's content type.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching a list of orders for a specific customer, where the customer ID is dynamically retrieved from another part of the lambda object.
 * - Integrating with an external order management API and automatically parsing the JSON response into Hyperlambda nodes for further processing.
 * - Creating a workflow that needs to retrieve and process order data based on user or system input without manual response parsing.
