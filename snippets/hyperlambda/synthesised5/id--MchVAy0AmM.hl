/*
 * 1. The [.val] node is defined with a boolean value of true.
 * 2. The [type] slot is invoked with an expression pointing to the [.val] node, so it returns the Hyperlambda type name of the value stored in [.val].
 * 3. As a result, the [type] slot will output "bool", indicating that the type of [.val]'s value is boolean.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Checking the type of a node's value before performing type-dependent operations.
 * - Debugging or validating node data types at runtime.
 * - Building dynamic logic that branches based on value types, such as type-based serialization or validation.
 * - Creating utility Hyperlambda code that adapts to different input types automatically.
