/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the node(s) referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. It will return the current value of the [.fields] node in the execution context.
 * 2. The expression `@.fields` points to the first node named [.fields] found before (up the hierarchy) from this point in the node structure.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the user input from a [.fields] node after form data has been collected.
 * - Fetching configuration values held in a [.fields] node for use elsewhere in your logic.
 * - Accessing results stored in [.fields] as an intermediate step in a data processing workflow.
 * - Retrieving a list or collection of fields from an earlier dynamic slot or HTTP request for further processing.
