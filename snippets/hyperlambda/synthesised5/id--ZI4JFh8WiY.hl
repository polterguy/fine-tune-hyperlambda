/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [average] node under [.scores] with the result of a mathematical operation.
 * 2. [math.divide] divides the value of the [total] node by the value of the [categories] node, both found as children of [.scores].
 * 3. [get-value] is used to retrieve the integer values from the [total] and [categories] nodes to be used as operands in the division.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically calculating an average score after updating total points and category count in a scoring system.
 * - Recomputing the mean value in a report when either the number of categories or the total changes.
 * - Dynamically updating summary statistics in a dashboard or analytics application.
