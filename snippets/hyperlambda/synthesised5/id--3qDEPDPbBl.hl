/*
 * 1. [slots.create] is used to define a new dynamic slot named [getPair]. This slot is only available at runtime and must be invoked via [signal] or [execute].
 * 2. [return-nodes] is called inside the dynamic slot. It returns multiple nodes to the caller, in this case, [key] with the value "Value" and [number] with the integer value 123.
 * 3. The returned nodes become the result of invoking the [getPair] slot, and will be available as children of the invocation node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning structured, multi-property data from a custom slot, such as key/value pairs or objects.
 * - Creating reusable slot-based components that return grouped values for further processing.
 * - Building simple APIs or endpoints that need to return more than one value in a single response.
 * - Adapting dynamic slot outputs for integration with other workflows that expect multiple values.
