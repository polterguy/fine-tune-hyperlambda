/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to append new nodes to a node set located at the path `:x:@for-each/@for-each/@.dp/#/*/tables/0/-/*/columns`.
 * 2. Nested nodes are created under the added node, with properties such as [name], [db], [nullable], [primary], [automatic], and [hl], each set to the value of the corresponding property from the current context node `@.dp/#/*`.
 * 3. The [name], [db], [nullable], [primary], [automatic], and [hl] nodes use lambda expressions to dynamically pull their values from the current data context, typically as part of a loop or batch operation.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Aggregating and transforming columns metadata from multiple tables into a single columns collection.
 * - Normalizing or enriching schema information during data modeling or code generation.
 * - Creating a unified structure for exporting, documentation, or further processing of database schema details.
 * - Preparing data for UI display, where consistent column descriptors are needed across different tables.
