/*
 * 1. The [return-nodes] slot is used to return a collection of nodes from within a dynamically created slot or a context that supports returning nodes.
 * 2. The `:x:@mysql.select/*` expression retrieves all child nodes of the [mysql.select] node and passes them as the nodes to be returned.
 * 3. This allows the slot to return the full result set produced by a previous [mysql.select] operation, preserving the node structure and all data fields.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a set of database records fetched by [mysql.select] from a custom dynamic slot to the caller.
 * - Passing a filtered or transformed collection of nodes as the output of a dynamic slot for further processing.
 * - Creating an API endpoint that returns the raw results of a MySQL query in Hyperlambda node format.
