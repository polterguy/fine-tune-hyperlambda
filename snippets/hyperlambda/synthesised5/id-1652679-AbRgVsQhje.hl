/*
 * 1. The [include] slot executes the children of the [data.read] node and includes its results in the current context.
 * 2. The [data.read] slot reads data from the [Book] table, selecting the [BookId] and [Title] columns.
 * 3. The [where] clause filters the results to only include books where the [PublisherId] column matches the value retrieved from the [PublisherId] node in the current [.dp] reference.
 * 4. The [yield] slot returns the result of the [data.read] operation as a [books] node, containing the selected books.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve all books published by a specific publisher, where the publisher is determined dynamically from the context.
 * - Use as part of a larger workflow to fetch related books for a given publisher in a data processing pipeline.
 * - Populate a list of books for a publisher detail view in an application by including this logic in an endpoint or dynamic slot.
