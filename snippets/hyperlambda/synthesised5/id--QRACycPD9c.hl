/*
 * 1. The [.hl-code] node is declared with a multi-line string value containing Hyperlambda code. This string includes two slot invocations: [log.info] with a message, and [math.add] that sums two integers.
 * 2. The string uses the @"..." syntax to allow for multi-line content, preserving line breaks and indentation within the value.
 * 3. The embedded Hyperlambda code is not executed as-is; it is stored as a plain string under the [.hl-code] node, which can later be parsed or executed dynamically (for example, using [hyper2lambda] and [eval] slots).
 * 4. This technique is useful for storing and transferring Hyperlambda code as data, which can be processed or serialized as needed.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Store Hyperlambda scripts in a database or configuration file for deferred execution.
 * - Dynamically load and run user-provided Hyperlambda code in a workflow engine.
 * - Serialize code samples for documentation or code generation tools.
