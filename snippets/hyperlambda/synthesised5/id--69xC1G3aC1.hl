/*
 * 1. The [get-name] slot retrieves the name of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.parent/*/child/.` navigates to the parent node of the [child] node under [.parent], effectively referencing the [.parent] node itself.
 * 3. Therefore, [get-name] will return the name of the [.parent] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve the name of a parent node from one of its children.
 * - Dynamically determine structural relationships in a node hierarchy.
 * - Useful for logging or validation where knowing the parent node's name is required.
