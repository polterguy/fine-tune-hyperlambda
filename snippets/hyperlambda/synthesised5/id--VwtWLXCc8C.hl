/*
 * 1. The [http.post] slot is used to send a POST request to the specified URL (`https://somewhere.com/api/v1/contacts`) with a payload containing [name] and [email], and the [convert] argument set to true, which means the response will be automatically converted if possible.
 * 2. An [if] conditional checks if the result of [http.post] has an integer value greater than or equal to 200 and less than 300, indicating a successful HTTP response (status codes in the 2xx range).
 * 3. If the condition is true, the value of [.contact.status] is set to "Success" using the [set-value] slot.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Registering a new contact in a remote system and updating local status only if the operation succeeds.
 * - Automating form submissions and handling the response to set a flag or trigger further actions.
 * - Integrating with third-party APIs to create resources, with local tracking of request success.
