/*
 * 1. The [set-name] slot is used to change the names of all nodes referenced by the expression `:+/+/*/*`. For each of these nodes, its new name will be set to the result of the [strings.concat] slot.
 * 2. [strings.concat] is invoked for each node being renamed and combines two pieces: the value of the current node referenced by `@p` and the value referenced by [get-value] with the expression `@.no`.
 * 3. [get-value] retrieves the value of the [.no] node, which is then appended to the string from `@p`, producing the new node name.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically rename a set of nested nodes by prefixing or suffixing them with numeric identifiers or other values.
 * - Implement a batch renaming system where node names are programmatically constructed from existing values.
 * - Reorganize or namespace nodes by embedding additional context (like a counter or type) into their names.
 * - Prepare data for export or transformation by ensuring all relevant nodes have uniquely generated names based on runtime information.
