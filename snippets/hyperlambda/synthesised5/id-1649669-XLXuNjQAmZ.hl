/*
 * 1. The [case] slot checks if the value matches 404, which is typically used inside a [switch] statement to handle specific cases.
 * 2. The [throw] slot raises an exception with the message "404 Not Found – User profile endpoint does not exist". This interrupts the normal flow and signals an error condition, likely returning an HTTP 404 error to the client.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a 404 error when a requested user profile endpoint is not found.
 * - Handling missing resources in an API by throwing descriptive exceptions.
 * - Providing clear error messages to clients when specific endpoints or data do not exist.
