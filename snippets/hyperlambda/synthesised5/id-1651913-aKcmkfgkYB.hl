/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates all its child node values into a single string.
 * 2. The first child node provides the static string "pragma index_info('".
 * 3. The [get-value] slot with the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/name` retrieves the value of the [name] child node from the node referenced by [.dp], which is typically passed in by reference (for example, in a [for-each] or [include] context).
 * 4. The final child node provides the static string "')", closing the SQL function call.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically constructing SQL statements for retrieving index information based on node data.
 * - Generating database queries in a loop where each [.dp] node represents a different table or index.
 * - Creating custom SQL command strings by combining static and dynamic node values.
