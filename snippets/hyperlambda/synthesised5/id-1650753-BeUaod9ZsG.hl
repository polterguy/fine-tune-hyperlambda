/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to read records from a database table.
 * 2. The [table] node specifies that the records will be selected from the [line_items] table.
 * 3. The [where] node is used to filter which records are returned from the [line_items] table.
 * 4. The [and] node under [where] indicates that multiple filter conditions can be combined using a logical AND, but no specific conditions are provided in this snippet.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve all records from the [line_items] table without any filtering (since no conditions are specified).
 * - Serve as a template to add multiple filter conditions for querying [line_items] (e.g., filtering by product ID and quantity).
 * - Form the basis for more complex queries involving additional arguments like [columns], [order], or [join].
