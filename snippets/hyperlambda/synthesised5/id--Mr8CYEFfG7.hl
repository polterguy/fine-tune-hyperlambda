/*
 * 1. The [.varOne] node is assigned the string value "test" without quotes, using the default string type.
 * 2. The [.varTwo] node is set to the string "data:entry" using double quotes, which allows inclusion of the colon character in its value.
 * 3. The [.varThree] node demonstrates a multi-line string using the @"..." syntax, enabling line breaks within the value.
 * 4. The [.varFour] node is assigned the string "hyper-sample" without quotes, as its value does not require escaping or special formatting.
 * 5. The [.varFive] node uses double quotes and an escape sequence (`\n`) to include a newline within the string value.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Define configuration values where some entries may need special characters or newlines.
 * - Store both simple and complex string data for later use in data processing or output.
 * - Maintain source data as variables, supporting values that include formatting or multi-line content.
 * - Prepare input data for slots that require specific string formatting, such as for HTTP payloads or logging.
