/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used here to aggregate nodes. It iterates over all nodes resulting from the expression `:x:@data.connect/*/data.select`.
 * 2. For each node found, it adds a new child node whose value is set to the referenced value of the currently iterated node, accessed via the [.dp] reference and the `#` iterator.
 * 3. This effectively collects the results from all [data.select] nodes under any child of [data.connect] and adds them as children to the current context.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Merging multiple SQL query results from different database connections into a single collection.
 * - Aggregating data from several sources for unified processing or export.
 * - Dynamically building a combined data set from multiple [data.select] operations for further transformation.
