/*
 * 1. The [io.file.exists] slot checks if the file "/config/settings.json" exists and stores the result (true or false) in the [.result] node.
 * 2. The [if] slot evaluates the value of the previous sibling node (using `:x:-`), which is [.result], and if its value is true, executes its child nodes.
 * 3. The [set-value] slot sets the value of [.result] to the string "File exists" if the [if] condition is met.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Displaying a message if a configuration file is present.
 * - Setting a flag or status in your application workflow based on the existence of a file.
 * - Preparing for conditional logic that only executes when a required settings file is available.
