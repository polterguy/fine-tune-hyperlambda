 * 1. The [not] slot inverts the result of its child condition, returning true if the child condition is false, and vice versa.
 * 2. The [eq] slot checks if the value retrieved by [get-value] from the [crypto.password.hash] node is exactly equal to the value of the second argument, which is an empty node (null or empty string).
 * 3. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [crypto.password.hash] node, which is expected to be a password hash.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To check if the [crypto.password.hash] node does not contain an empty or null value after attempting to hash a password.
 * - To ensure that a password hashing operation has produced a valid, non-empty hash before proceeding with further logic.
 * - To validate that a password hash exists before attempting to verify or store it.
