/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of a specific node referenced by the expression provided in its value argument. In this case, it is used to fetch the value of a child node named [limit] that exists within the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/limit` navigates to the [.arguments] node, accesses all its direct children, and then selects the [limit] node among those children.
 * 
 * 3. This pattern is frequently used in endpoint or slot implementations to extract user-provided or default argument values, which can then be used for further processing, validation, or as input to other operations.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Reading a pagination or query limit parameter supplied by a client to control the number of results returned in an endpoint response.
 * - Retrieving a user-specified value from an HTTP request's arguments for use in business logic.
 * - Extracting optional configuration or threshold values from arguments in dynamic slot execution.
