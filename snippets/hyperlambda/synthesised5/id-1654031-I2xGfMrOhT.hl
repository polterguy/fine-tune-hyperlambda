/*
 * 1. [tasks.create] is used to create a new scheduled task with a dynamic ID generated by concatenating values using [strings.concat]. The task is described as deleting a demo chatbot 7 days after creation, and is scheduled for execution at a future time calculated by [math.add].
 * 2. Inside the [.lambda] of the task:
 *    - The [.type] node is set, likely referencing the chatbot type to be deleted.
 *    - [data.connect] connects to a database (either "generic" or "magic"), and [data.execute] deletes records from the [vss_ml_training_snippets] table where the associated [ml_training_snippets] records match the given type.
 *    - The [.task] node is set with a concatenated value, possibly to reference the task's own ID for later deletion.
 *    - Another [data.connect] is made, and [data.delete] removes the corresponding type entry from the [ml_types] table where the type matches.
 *    - [strings.concat] builds the file path for the chatbot's HTML file, combining "/etc/www/", the type value, and ".html".
 *    - [io.file.delete] deletes the chatbot's HTML file at the constructed path.
 *    - [log.info] logs that the demo chatbot was deleted, including the type.
 *    - [tasks.delete] deletes the task itself, cleaning up after execution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically remove demo chatbots and all related data and files 7 days after their creation to enforce trial or demo expiration.
 * - Clean up database entries and associated files for a specific chatbot type as part of a scheduled maintenance or data retention policy.
 * - Ensure that temporary or demo resources are not left orphaned in the system by scheduling their deletion and self-cleanup.
