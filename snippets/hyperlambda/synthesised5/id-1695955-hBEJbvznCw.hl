/*
 * 1. [remove-nodes] is used to delete nodes from a lambda object. In this case, it targets all [keyword_count] nodes that are children of any node, which itself is a child of [data.select].
 * 2. The expression `:x:@data.select/*/*/keyword_count` means: find the [data.select] node, then for each of its child nodes, look at their children, and remove any node named [keyword_count].
 * 3. This operation is destructive for the targeted nodes, permanently deleting any [keyword_count] node found at this depth and path.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up result sets by removing [keyword_count] fields before further processing or output.
 * - Stripping sensitive or unnecessary aggregate data from query results before returning them to a client.
 * - Preparing a data structure for serialization or export, omitting intermediate computed values.
