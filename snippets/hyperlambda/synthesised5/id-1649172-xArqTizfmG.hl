/*
 * 1. The [type] slot is used to return the Hyperlambda type name of a given value.
 * 2. In this example, [type] is invoked with a static string value "string" as its argument, so it will return "string" as the type name.
 * 3. The slot can be used to dynamically determine the type of a node's value or to verify type information in logic flows.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To check or display the type of a value for debugging or validation purposes.
 * - To implement dynamic logic based on the type of a node's value.
 * - To assist in type conversions or enforce type constraints in custom workflows.
