/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to add a new node as a child to the node set referenced by the expression `:x:@data.connect/*/data.read/*/where/*/and`. This means it targets all [and] nodes that are descendants of [where], which are themselves descendants of [data.read], under any [data.connect] node.
 * 2. The child node being added is an unnamed node (name is [.]), which itself has a child node [type.eq]. The [type.eq] node uses an expression `:x:@.arguments/*/type` as its value, meaning it sets the value of [type.eq] to the value of the [type] node under [.arguments].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically add a filter condition to an existing SQL query, ensuring that the [type] field must equal a specified value.
 * - Programmatically build complex queries by injecting additional AND conditions based on user input or API arguments.
 * - Enhance or modify existing query structures in a workflow, such as adding type-based filtering to a search endpoint.
