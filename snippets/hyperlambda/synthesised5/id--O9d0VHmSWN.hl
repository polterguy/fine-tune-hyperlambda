/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a connection to the database named [warehouse], making it available for subsequent database operations.
 * 2. The [data.select] slot is used to execute two SQL queries in a single batch: `select * from table1; select * from table2;`, allowing for the retrieval of data from both [table1] and [table2].
 * 3. The [multiple-result-sets] node set to boolean true instructs [data.select] to return the results of both queries as separate result sets, each represented as an array of records in the returned lambda object.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching and processing the contents of two or more tables in a single database call for efficiency.
 * - Performing multi-table data exports where the structure of each table's data must be preserved in the results.
 * - Implementing data synchronization or backup routines that require retrieving multiple tables' data together.
 * - Creating dashboards or reports that need to display information from several tables simultaneously.
