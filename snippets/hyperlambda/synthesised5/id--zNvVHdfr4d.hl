/*
 * 1. [if]: Checks if the current user has the "sales" role using [auth.ticket.in-role]. If this condition is true, the code in the [.lambda] node will execute.
 * 2. [auth.ticket.in-role]: Determines if the user belongs to the "sales" role.
 * 3. [set-value]: Sets the value of [.dashboard] to either "/dashboards/sales.hl" or "/dashboards/default.hl" depending on the role check.
 * 4. [else]: If the [if] condition is false (user is not in "sales"), this sets [.dashboard] to "/dashboards/default.hl".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically assigning a dashboard view based on the user's role for personalized access.
 * - Ensuring users in the "sales" role get a specialized dashboard while others get a default version.
 * - Implementing role-based navigation or redirection logic for endpoint responses.
 * - Providing differentiated user experiences in a web application according to assigned roles.
