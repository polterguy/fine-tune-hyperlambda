/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@.fields`.
 * 2. The `@.fields` expression points to the first ancestor or sibling node named [.fields], and [get-value] will return its value.
 * 3. This is commonly used to extract the value from a specific node in the tree for use in further processing or comparisons.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving the value of a form field stored in a [.fields] node for validation.
 * - Accessing configuration or data values dynamically in a workflow.
 * - Passing the value of [.fields] as an argument to another slot or function.
