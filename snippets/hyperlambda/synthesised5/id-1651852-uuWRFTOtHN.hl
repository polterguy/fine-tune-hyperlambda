 * 1. The [strings.ends-with] slot checks if the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.dp/#` ends with the string "css".
 * 2. The first argument to [strings.ends-with] is an expression that resolves to a node, and the second argument is the string value to check for at the end of the referenced string.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To determine if a filename stored in [.dp] has a ".css" extension.
 * - To filter or process only those nodes whose values end with "css", such as when handling or serving CSS files in a web application.
