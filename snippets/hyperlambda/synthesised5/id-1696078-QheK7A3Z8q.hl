/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node identified by the expression `:x:@.sql`.
 * 2. The `:x:@.sql` expression points to the first ancestor or sibling node named [.sql] relative to the current node.
 * 3. The value of the [.sql] node is returned as the result of this operation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the generated SQL statement from a previously constructed [.sql] node for logging or debugging.
 * - Passing the SQL string value to another slot or operation that requires the raw query.
 * - Displaying the SQL command to users for educational purposes or transparency in a debugging interface.
 * - Storing the SQL query in a variable for later use or comparison.
