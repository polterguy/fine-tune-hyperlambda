/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to query data from a data source, specifying the table to read from and the columns to return.
 * 2. The [table] node specifies that data should be read from the [Course] table.
 * 3. The [columns] node lists the columns to be included in the result set, specifically [CourseId] and [Title].
 * 4. The [where] node defines filtering criteria for the query.
 * 5. The [and] node allows for one or more conditions to be combined with logical AND.
 * 6. The [ProfessorId.eq] node specifies a condition where the [ProfessorId] column must be equal to a value.
 * 7. The expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/ProfessorId` dynamically retrieves the value for [ProfessorId] from a referenced node, likely passed in as a parameter or from a data context.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve all courses taught by a specific professor, where the professor's ID is provided dynamically.
 * - Display a filtered list of courses on a web page based on the currently selected professor.
 * - Generate reports or perform operations that require fetching only the courses associated with a particular professor.
