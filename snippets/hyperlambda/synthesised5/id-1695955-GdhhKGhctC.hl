/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate multiple string values into one single string, combining the current value of [.sql] with the static strings " from ", "CustomerDemographics", and " where keyword_count > 0".
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [.sql] node, which is then used as the first part of the resulting concatenated string.
 * 3. The child nodes with the dot (.) names and string values represent static string fragments that are appended in order after the value of [.sql].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Building a dynamic SQL query by appending a FROM clause and a WHERE condition to a previously constructed SQL SELECT statement.
 * - Extending an existing string variable with additional query components, such as table names and filtering conditions.
 * - Generating complex SQL queries programmatically based on user input or business logic, by incrementally constructing the query string.
