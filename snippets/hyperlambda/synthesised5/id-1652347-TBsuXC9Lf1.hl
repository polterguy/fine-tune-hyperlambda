/*
 * 1. The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to at least one of the roles specified in its value, which in this case are "admin", "guest", or "root".
 * 2. If the user does not belong to any of these roles, the slot throws an exception, effectively preventing further execution and denying access.
 * 3. This slot is typically used at the beginning of an HTTP endpoint to enforce role-based access control, ensuring only authorized users with the required roles can proceed.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Restricting access to an endpoint so that only users with "admin", "guest", or "root" roles can invoke it.
 * - Protecting sensitive operations by requiring elevated privileges.
 * - Implementing multi-role access policies for shared resources or administrative panels.
