/*
 * 1. The [else] slot defines logic that is executed if none of the preceding conditional branches are true, serving as a default code path.
 * 2. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.sql] node with the result of the following string concatenation operation.
 * 3. The [strings.concat] slot combines several string fragments and values, dynamically constructing a complex SQL expression, which is then assigned to [.sql].
 * 4. Several [get-value] slots retrieve the current values of [.sql], [.fields], and [.no], inserting them into specific positions within the concatenated string.
 * 5. The string fragments being combined form a SQL expression that calculates the count of occurrences of a given substring (value of [.no]) within the string represented by [.fields], using SQL functions like length(), replace(), and lower().
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Dynamically building a SQL query segment to count the number of times a specific substring appears in a text column.
 * - Providing a fallback logic for SQL generation when none of the prior conditions are met.
 * - Supporting advanced reporting queries where substring analysis is required within a database field.
 * - Automating string-based computations in SQL queries by assembling expressions at runtime.
 * - Updating an in-memory SQL command representation before execution based on conditional logic.
