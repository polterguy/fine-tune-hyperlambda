/*
 * 1. The [strings.starts-with] slot checks if the value of the [url] node inside the [.arguments] node begins with the string "https://".
 * 2. The `:x:@.arguments/*/url` expression retrieves the [url] node from the [.arguments] collection, typically used to access HTTP endpoint arguments.
 * 3. The child node with value "https://" specifies the prefix that the [url] value must start with for the slot to return true.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating that a user-provided URL uses the HTTPS protocol before processing it further.
 * - Implementing security checks to ensure only secure URLs are accepted in API endpoints.
 * - Filtering or flagging URLs that do not start with "https://" in a list of submitted links.
