/*
 * 1. The [math.min] slot compares all its arguments and returns the smallest value among them. 
 * 2. The [get-value] slot is used three times to extract integer values from the [t1], [t2], and [t3] nodes, which are children of the [.sensors] node.
 * 3. The result of [math.min], which is the lowest value among the sensor readings, is placed under the [.lowest] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Determining the lowest temperature reading from a group of sensors.
 * - Comparing three different performance metrics and finding the minimal value.
 * - Monitoring environmental data and storing the minimum value for further analysis.
 * - Selecting the minimum among several user input values for validation purposes.
