/*
 * 1. [data.connect] establishes a database connection using the "crm" connection string, granting access to subsequent database operations within its children.
 * 2. [try] begins a try-catch block, allowing graceful recovery if an error occurs during the transaction.
 * 3. [data.transaction.create] starts a new database transaction, ensuring all subsequent operations are executed atomically.
 * 4. [data.execute] runs a SQL DELETE statement to remove users with a "pending" status from the "users" table.
 * 5. [throw] simulates an error by explicitly raising an exception, which interrupts the transaction flow before the transaction can be committed.
 * 6. [.catch] handles the simulated failure, ensuring the transaction is rolled back using [data.transaction.rollback], and logs an error via [log.error].
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Safely deleting records from the database with the guarantee that if any error occurs, the deletion is undone.
 * - Simulating failure scenarios in transaction logic for testing rollback and error handling mechanisms.
 * - Logging and auditing transaction failures for monitoring or debugging purposes.
