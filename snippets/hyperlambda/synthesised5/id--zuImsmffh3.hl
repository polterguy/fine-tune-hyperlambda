/*
 * 1. The [math.add] slot adds together the values of all its child nodes.
 * 2. Each child node in this example is an integer value node ([.:int:1], [.:int:2], [.:int:3], [.:int:4]).
 * 3. The slot will evaluate all children and return their sum as its result (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Calculating the total of a set of numeric constants.
 * - Summing up values collected from multiple sources to produce a grand total.
 * - Quickly performing arithmetic addition in scripts for result aggregation.
 * - Automating financial calculations, such as adding up expenses.
