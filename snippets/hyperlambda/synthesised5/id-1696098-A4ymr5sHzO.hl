/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node(s) referenced by the lambda expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it will return the value contained in the [.fields] node relative to the current execution context.
 * 2. The expression uses the `@` iterator to locate the first ancestor or sibling node named [.fields], and [get-value] extracts its value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting a user's submitted form data stored in a [.fields] node for further processing.
 * - Retrieving configuration or parameter values dynamically from a shared [.fields] node in a workflow.
 * - Accessing temporary data previously set in [.fields] during a multi-step logic process.
