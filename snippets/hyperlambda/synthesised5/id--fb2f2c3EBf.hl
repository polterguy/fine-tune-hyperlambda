/*
 * 1. The [strings.to-lower] slot converts all characters in its value to lowercase. In this case, it takes the string "MixedCase123" and transforms it to "mixedcase123".
 * 2. The slot processes both alphabetic and numeric characters, but only the alphabetic ones are affected. Numbers and non-letter characters remain unchanged.
 * 3. The result of executing this node is a new value for [strings.to-lower], which will be the fully lowercased version of the original string.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Standardizing user input for case-insensitive comparisons or storage.
 * - Preparing data for search or matching operations where case should not matter.
 * - Cleaning up mixed-case data before further text processing or exporting.
 * - Formatting usernames, email addresses, or tags to a consistent style.
