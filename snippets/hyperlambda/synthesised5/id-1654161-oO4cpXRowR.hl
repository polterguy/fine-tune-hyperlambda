/*
 * 1. The [not-exists] slot checks whether its specified expression yields zero results. If so, it evaluates to true; otherwise, it evaluates to false.
 * 2. The expression `@.result/*/"={@strings.split/0}"` dynamically constructs a path that looks for a child node under [result] whose value equals the value of the first node returned by [strings.split]. If no such node exists, [not-exists] will return true.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To verify that a particular value (the first result from [strings.split]) does not exist as a child node under [result].
 * - To conditionally execute logic only if a specific split string is not already present in [result].
 * - To enforce uniqueness of values in a collection by checking absence before insertion.
