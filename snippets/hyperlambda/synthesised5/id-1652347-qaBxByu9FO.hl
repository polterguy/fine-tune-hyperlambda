/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to read data from a database table, in this case from the [Doctors] table.
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies that the database being queried is of type "sqlite".
 * 3. The [columns] node includes a single aggregate column, [count(*)], which will count all rows in the [Doctors] table. The [as:count] child node aliases the result column as "count".
 * 4. The [where] node is present with an [and] child, but no conditions are specified, so no filtering is applied to the query.
 * 5. The [limit] node is set to 1, so the query will return only one row containing the count.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve the total number of doctors in the [Doctors] table for reporting or dashboard purposes.
 * - Check if there are any doctors in the database by verifying if the count is greater than zero.
 * - Use as a part of a health check endpoint to ensure the [Doctors] table is accessible and contains data.
