/*
 * 1. The [execute-file] slot is used to execute the Hyperlambda file located at "/modules/config/load.hl".  
 * 2. The [environment] argument is passed to the executed file, and its value is dynamically retrieved from the [.env] node using the expression `:x:@.env`.  
 * 3. The value of [.env] is "dev", so [environment] will have the value "dev" inside "/modules/config/load.hl".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically load different configuration settings based on the environment (e.g., development, production, staging).
 * - Centralize application initialization by delegating environment-specific logic to an external file.
 * - Easily switch environments by changing the value of [.env] without modifying the rest of the code.
