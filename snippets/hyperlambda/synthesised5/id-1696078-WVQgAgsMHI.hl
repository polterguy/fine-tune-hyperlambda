/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.sql] node, using an expression to locate it.
 * 2. [strings.concat] concatenates the current value of [.sql] with a static string value `) as keyword_count`, effectively appending this string to whatever is already present in [.sql].
 * 3. [get-value] retrieves the existing value of [.sql] so that it can be included in the concatenation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Appending an SQL alias clause to the end of an existing query stored in [.sql].
 * - Dynamically building up SQL strings through multiple steps, where this step adds an aggregation or alias part.
 * - Modifying or extending an existing SQL command near the end of a query assembly process.
 * - Creating readable and maintainable logic for query manipulation by separating concatenation logic into distinct steps.
