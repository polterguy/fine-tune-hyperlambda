/*
 * 1. The node [.string4] is being assigned the string value "foo". 
 * 2. No type is specified, so the default type is string.
 * 3. This node can now be referenced elsewhere in the Hyperlambda graph, for example using expressions like `:x:@.string4` to access its value.
 * 4. The node name starts with a dot, making it a data node and not a slot.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Store a temporary string value for later processing.
 * - Use [.string4] as an argument to string manipulation slots such as [strings.concat].
 * - Reference [.string4] in conditional logic to compare its value.
 * - Pass the value of [.string4] to another dynamic slot as input data.
