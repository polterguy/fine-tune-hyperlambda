/*
 * 1. The [strings.split] slot splits the value of the [query] node inside the [.arguments] node into multiple substrings, using a space character as the delimiter.
 * 2. The [add] slot appends the resulting substrings from [strings.split] to the [.words] node, effectively populating [.words] with each individual word from the original [query] string.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Breaking apart a search query into separate keywords for indexing or filtering.
 * - Preparing user input for further processing, such as autocomplete or search suggestions.
 * - Extracting words from a sentence to perform text analysis or word count.
 * - Transforming a single string input into a node list for iteration or additional manipulation.
