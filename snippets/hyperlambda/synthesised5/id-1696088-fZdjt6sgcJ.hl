/*
 * 1. The [add] slot appends one or more nodes to a destination node, specified by its expression argument.
 * 2. The `:x:@data.connect/*/data.select` expression finds all [data.select] nodes that are children of any node under [data.connect].
 * 3. Inside the [add] slot, the [.] node contains a single child node with a value, which uses the `:x:@.dp/#` expression to reference the currently iterated [data.select] node by reference.
 * 4. The [add] slot will effectively duplicate or move all [data.select] nodes under [data.connect] into the current context as new child nodes.
 * 
 * Possible use cases:
 * - Collecting and merging multiple [data.select] result sets from various database connections into a single execution tree for further aggregation or analysis.
 * - Dynamically appending SQL query results from multiple sources to a working node for unified post-processing.
 * - Creating a composite report by including data from several database queries executed in different contexts.
 * - Transferring database result nodes into a new structure for export, transformation, or serialization.
