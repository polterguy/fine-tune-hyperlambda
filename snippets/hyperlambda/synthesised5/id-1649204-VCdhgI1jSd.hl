/*
 * 1. The [data.create] slot is used to generate and execute an SQL INSERT statement to add a new record into a database table.
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies the type of database to target, in this case [sqlite], ensuring the correct SQL dialect and adapter are used.
 * 3. The [table] node indicates the name of the table ([questionnaires]) where the new record will be inserted.
 * 4. The [values] node is intended to contain child nodes representing the column names and their respective values for the new record.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Inserting a new questionnaire entry into a SQLite database from a web form submission.
 * - Creating seed data for the [questionnaires] table during application setup or testing.
 * - Adding user-generated survey data into the [questionnaires] table as part of a data collection workflow.
