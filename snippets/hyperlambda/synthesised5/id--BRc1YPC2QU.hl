/*
 * 1. The [date.now] slot is used to retrieve the current UTC date and time, producing a node containing this value with no arguments required.
 * 2. The [log.info] slot logs an informational message, where the message includes a child node [date] whose value is populated by referencing the value of the [date.now] node using the `:x:@date.now` expression.
 * 3. The [date] node under [log.info] dynamically inserts the current date and time into the log entry, enabling the log message to contain a timestamp.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Logging the exact date and time when a specific process or operation starts.
 * - Recording the current date and time in an audit trail for later analysis.
 * - Providing real-time date and time information in application logs for debugging or monitoring purposes.
 * - Creating entries for scheduled or periodic tasks that require a timestamp of execution.
