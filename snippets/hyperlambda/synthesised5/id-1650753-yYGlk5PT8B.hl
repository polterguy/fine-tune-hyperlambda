/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to add new nodes as children to all sibling nodes of the current node that are named [data.read].
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot is invoked twice to retrieve any nodes named [limit] and [offset] that are children of the [.arguments] node.
 * 3. The result of the [get-nodes] invocations (i.e., the [limit] and [offset] nodes, if present) are added as children to all [data.read] sibling nodes.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically inject [limit] and [offset] arguments into SQL read operations to enable paging.
 * - Automatically propagate endpoint arguments for pagination into a data access node.
 * - Extend or modify the behavior of all [data.read] nodes in a workflow by adding additional parameters based on incoming arguments.
