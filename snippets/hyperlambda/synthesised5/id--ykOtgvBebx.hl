/*
 * 1. The [auth.ticket.verify] slot ensures that only users with roles "root" or "admin" are authorized to execute the endpoint.
 * 2. [data.connect] establishes a connection to the "scraper" database using the generic provider with SQLite as the backend.
 * 3. The [add] slots inject pagination and sorting arguments ([order], [direction], [limit], [offset]) from [.arguments] directly into the [data.read] request, dynamically constructing the query.
 * 4. [remove-nodes] cleans up these specific pagination and sorting nodes from [.arguments] after they are injected, to avoid redundancy or conflicts.
 * 5. Another [add] slot collects all remaining filter arguments from [.arguments] and appends them as conditions in the [and] node inside the [where] clause of [data.read].
 * 6. [data.read] fetches records from the [spice_urls] table, selecting the [spice_urls.spice_url_id], [spice_urls.url], and [spice_urls.type] columns, applying any [where] filtering built from the arguments.
 * 7. [return-nodes] outputs the result nodes from the executed [data.read] operation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetch a paginated and filtered list of URLs from the [spice_urls] table, with support for sorting and complex search criteria, for admin dashboards.
 * - Dynamically construct queries based on user-supplied search fields, such as finding URLs of a certain type or matching partial strings.
 * - Securely restrict access to sensitive data by enforcing role-based authentication at the endpoint level.
 * - Support efficient data browsing in management tools by leveraging offset and limit for pagination.
 * - Enable flexible API endpoints that adapt to varying combinations of search, sort, and paging parameters without manual query assembly.
