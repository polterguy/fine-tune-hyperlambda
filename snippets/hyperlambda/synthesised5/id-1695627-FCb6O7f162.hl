/*
 * 1. The [strings.starts-with] slot checks whether the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@csv2lambda/0/0` begins with the string "https://".
 * 2. The expression `:x:@csv2lambda/0/0` navigates to the first child of the first child of the [csv2lambda] node, extracting its value for the check.
 * 3. The slot returns true if the referenced string starts with "https://", and false otherwise.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Verifying that a URL extracted from a CSV column is using HTTPS before further processing.
 * - Implementing validation logic to ensure all links in imported CSV data are secure.
 * - Filtering or flagging records during CSV import based on whether certain fields contain secure URLs.
 * - Enforcing compliance checks on user-uploaded CSV files to only allow entries with secure web addresses.
