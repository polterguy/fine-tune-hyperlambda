 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot is used to ensure that a required argument is present.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/channel` targets all [channel] nodes that are children of any node under [.arguments].
 * 3. If any targeted [channel] node does not exist, the slot throws an exception, enforcing that the [channel] argument must be supplied.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating that a required [channel] parameter is provided in an HTTP endpoint's input.
 * - Enforcing the presence of a [channel] field in a form submission before processing.
 * - Ensuring that configuration or command input always includes a [channel] value.
