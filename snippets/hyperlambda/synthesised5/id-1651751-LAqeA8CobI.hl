 * 1. The [if] slot checks a condition and executes its [.lambda] child only if the condition is true.
 * 2. The [not] slot inverts the result of its child condition, so the [.lambda] is executed only if the child condition is false.
 * 3. The [eq] slot compares two values for equality: the value retrieved from [crypto.password.hash] and the value of the current node (represented by [.]).
 * 4. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [crypto.password.hash] node.
 * 5. The [set-value] slot assigns the value from [crypto.password.hash] to the node referenced by [.arguments/0/#].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that a password hash is only updated if it differs from the current value.
 * - Preventing unnecessary writes to a data store if the hash has not changed.
 * - Synchronizing password hashes across different nodes or arguments only when a change is detected.
