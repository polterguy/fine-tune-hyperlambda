/*
 * 1. The [cache.set] slot is used here to store an item in the cache, using [cache-item-key] as the key for the cache entry.
 * 2. No [value] or [expiration] child nodes are provided, so the slot will remove any existing cache entry with the key [cache-item-key], effectively serving as a cache removal operation.
 * 3. If an item with the key [cache-item-key] exists prior to this invocation, it will be deleted from the cache.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Removing a specific cached item by its key when the associated data becomes outdated or invalid.
 * - Clearing sensitive information from the cache after it has been processed.
 * - Programmatically expiring cache entries before their natural expiration time in response to data changes elsewhere.
