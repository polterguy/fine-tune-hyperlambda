/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it finds the first node named [.fields] relative to the current context and returns its value.
 * 2. This slot is commonly used to extract the direct value of a node for use in further processing, such as assignments, comparisons, or output.
 * 3. The expression `@.fields` ensures that only the first matching [.fields] node is targeted, regardless of its position among siblings.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the value of a [.fields] node containing user-submitted form data to validate or store it.
 * - Accessing configuration settings stored under a [.fields] node for use in business logic.
 * - Retrieving a list or object stored as the value of a [.fields] node to pass it into another operation or function.
