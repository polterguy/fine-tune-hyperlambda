/*
 * 1. The [data.create] slot is used to insert a new record into a database table.  
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies that the operation should use SQLite as the database provider.  
 * 3. The [table] node identifies the target table for the insert operation, in this case [leads].  
 * 4. The [values] node is intended to contain child nodes representing the column names and their corresponding values to be inserted into the [leads] table.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Adding a new lead to a CRM system by inserting their details into the [leads] table.
 * - Creating a record in a SQLite database for tracking new customer inquiries.
 * - Populating the [leads] table with initial data during application setup or testing.
