/*
 * 1. The [get-count] slot is invoked with the expression `:x:@.list/*`, which targets all child nodes of the [.list] node.
 * 2. [get-count] evaluates the expression and returns the total number of nodes it resolves toâ€”in this case, the number of children under [.list].
 * 3. The result is the count of items directly beneath the [.list] node, which in this example would be 2.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Determining the number of records or entries in a list to display or process.
 * - Validating that a collection has the expected number of items before performing further operations.
 * - Implementing pagination by knowing how many elements are present in a collection.
