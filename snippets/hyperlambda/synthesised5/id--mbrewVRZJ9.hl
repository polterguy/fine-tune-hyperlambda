/*
 * 1. The [exists] slot checks whether the given expression returns one or more nodes and evaluates to true if so, otherwise false.
 * 2. The first [exists] checks for children under [.src1], which contains a [foo] node, so it will return true.
 * 3. The second [exists] checks for children under [.src2], which has no children, so it will return false.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Verifying if a configuration section like [.src1] has any defined settings.
 * - Conditionally executing logic only if a data node contains child elements.
 * - Checking if user-submitted or dynamically created nodes are empty before further processing.
