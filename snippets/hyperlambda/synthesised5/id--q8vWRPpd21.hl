/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot is used to retrieve the value of a specific node based on an expression.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.sequence/*/beta/+` navigates to the [beta] child of the [.sequence] node, then uses the `+` iterator to move to the next sibling node at the same level, which is [gamma], and retrieves its value.
 * 3. The code demonstrates how to traverse sibling nodes using lambda expressions and extract values dynamically from a structured node tree.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the value of a node that follows another node in a sequence, such as getting the next step in a workflow.
 * - Navigating XML or data structures where sibling relationships are important for data processing.
 * - Dynamically accessing configuration or processing steps in a defined order for automation scripts.
 * - Implementing logic that depends on the order or adjacency of elements within a parent node.
