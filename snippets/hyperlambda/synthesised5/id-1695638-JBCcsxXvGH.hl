/*
 * 1. The [exists] slot is used to check if there is at least one node named [prefix-url] within the [.arguments] node. It evaluates the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/prefix-url`.
 * 2. If the [prefix-url] node exists within [.arguments], [exists] will return true; otherwise, it returns false.
 * 3. This approach is commonly used for conditional logic, such as verifying that an expected argument has been provided before proceeding with further logic.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Before attempting to access the value of [prefix-url], ensure it is present to avoid runtime errors.
 * - Dynamically branch logic depending on whether [prefix-url] was supplied in the HTTP request.
 * - Validate optional arguments and only apply related processing if [prefix-url] exists.
