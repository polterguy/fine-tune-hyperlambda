/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@.sql`. This means it finds the first node named [.sql] in the current context and returns its value.
 * 2. The `x:` argument indicates an expression is being used to locate the node, not just a static path.
 * 3. This slot does not evaluate child nodes or interpret the value, it simply fetches the raw value stored in the referenced [.sql] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the SQL statement or command from a [.sql] node after it has been composed elsewhere in the workflow.
 * - Fetching a dynamically generated value (such as a query or string) from a node for further processing or logging.
 * - Passing the retrieved value into another slot that requires the SQL command as input, such as for debugging or generating documentation.
