/*
 * 1. The [lambda2hyper] slot converts a lambda object (node hierarchy) into its textual Hyperlambda representation. The expression `:x:@.lambda/*` specifies that all child nodes of the [.lambda] node will be serialized.
 * 2. The [comments] argument with a value of true instructs [lambda2hyper] to preserve any comments found in the lambda structure, outputting them as part of the resulting Hyperlambda text.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Serializing a dynamically constructed lambda object (including its comments) to Hyperlambda text for storage or transmission.
 * - Exporting a lambda structure with documentation comments to a file for version control or sharing with other systems.
 * - Converting in-memory lambda nodes (with comments) into Hyperlambda code for editing or review by developers.
