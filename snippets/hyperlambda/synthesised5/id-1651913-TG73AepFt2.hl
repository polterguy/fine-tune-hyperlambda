/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to append nodes to the nodes referenced by its main expression. Here, it targets all [return-nodes] nodes that are siblings of the current node's parent (`:x:../*/return-nodes`).
 * 2. The child node of [add] is a node containing a subtree with [name] and [columns] nodes.
 * 3. The [name] node uses an expression to set its value to the value of the [name] node found as a child of the node referenced by [.dp]. The [.dp] node is typically provided by a [for-each] or similar slot, and is passed by reference.
 * 4. The [columns] node is created as an empty node under each added node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically appending a set of nodes to all [return-nodes] nodes in a result tree, where each appended node contains a [name] value copied from another node and an empty [columns] node.
 * - Building up a result set in a dynamic slot or endpoint, where you want to aggregate or transform data into a specific structure.
 * - Generating tabular or hierarchical data structures by iterating over a collection and adding formatted nodes to a result container.
