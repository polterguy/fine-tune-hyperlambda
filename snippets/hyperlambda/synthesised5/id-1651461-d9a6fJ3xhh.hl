/*
 * 1. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all nodes referenced by the expression provided in its value.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@http.get/*/content/*/headers` navigates from the [http.get] node, through all its children, then into each [content] node, then through all their children, and finally selects all [headers] nodes found at that level.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extract all [headers] nodes from the content of an HTTP GET response for further processing or inspection.
 * - Aggregate or analyze HTTP response headers from multiple content nodes after performing batch HTTP GET requests.
 * - Pass the extracted [headers] nodes to another part of the workflow for logging, validation, or conditional logic.
