/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node is used to declare that the endpoint expects a [name] argument of type string.
 * 2. The [validators.mandatory] slot checks that the [name] argument is present in the request; if it is missing, an exception is thrown.
 * 3. The [request.cookies.get] slot retrieves the value of a cookie whose name matches the value of the [name] argument, using the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/name`.
 * 4. The [yield] slot returns a node named [result], which contains the value fetched from [request.cookies.get].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve the value of a specific cookie by providing its name as a query parameter or in the request payload.
 * - Enforce that the caller specifies which cookie to fetch, preventing accidental or unauthorized access to other cookies.
 * - Can be used in authentication flows to validate the presence of session or authentication cookies.
 * - Useful in APIs that need to read user preferences or session data stored in cookies.
