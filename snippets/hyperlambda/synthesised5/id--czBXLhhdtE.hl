/*
 * 1. The [auth.ticket.create] slot generates a new JWT token using the provided [username] and a list of roles under the [roles] node. The username in this case is "john.doe", and the user is assigned the roles "editor" and "reviewer".
 * 2. The [roles] node defines multiple user roles, each as a separate child node (e.g., [.], value "editor" and "reviewer"), which will be embedded as claims within the generated JWT token.
 * 3. The resulting JWT token can be returned to a client for authentication and authorization in subsequent requests.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Issue a new authentication token for a user with specific access privileges, such as assigning editorial and review permissions in a content management system.
 * - Support role-based access control in an API by creating JWTs that encode multiple user roles.
 * - Automate user provisioning in an internal admin tool by programmatically generating tokens for new team members with their appropriate roles.
