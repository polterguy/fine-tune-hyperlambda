/*
 * 1. The [strings.join] slot takes the values of all child nodes of [.fields], joins them into a single string, and separates each value with " || ".
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.fields/*` selects every child node of [.fields] to be joined.
 * 3. The separator is defined as a child node with the value " || ", meaning the resulting string will insert this sequence between each joined value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Generating a concatenated list of field names for a SQL SELECT statement, separated by " || ".
 * - Creating a readable string of error messages from multiple fields, joined with a visible delimiter.
 * - Formatting a list of user inputs or tags into a single string for display, where each value is clearly separated.
