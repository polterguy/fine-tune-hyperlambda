/*
 * 1. The [pgsql.connect] slot establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database named "usersdb".
 * 2. The [pgsql.scalar] slot executes the SQL command "select count(*) from users" against the "usersdb" database, retrieving the total number of records in the "users" table as a scalar value.
 * 3. The [yield] slot returns the result of the scalar query, assigning the value to a [total-users] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Counting the total number of user records in the "users" table for dashboard statistics.
 * - Quickly checking database growth or system usage by retrieving the user count.
 * - Validating if the "users" table contains any records before performing further operations.
 * - Returning the user count as a response in an HTTP endpoint for administrative interfaces.
