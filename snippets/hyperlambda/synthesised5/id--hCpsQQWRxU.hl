/*
 * 1. The [add] slot appends nodes to a destination node. In this case, it targets the [.storage] node as the destination.
 * 2. The child node under [add] is a container node, which itself contains an [item] node with a value of "detail". This design allows for grouping nodes or evaluating more complex expressions before adding.
 * 3. As a result of execution, the [.storage] node will have a new child node named [item] with the value "detail" added to its children collection.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Dynamically add new items to a list or collection stored under [.storage].
 * - Append user-submitted content to a storage node in a workflow.
 * - Organize nodes into a persistent or temporary storage location for further processing.
