/*
 * 1. The [if] slot evaluates its first condition argument, which is set to boolean true.
 * 2. The [if] slot receives a second argument, also boolean true, which is ignored because [if] only requires a single condition argument.
 * 3. If the condition evaluates to true, the [.lambda] block is executed.
 * 4. Inside [.lambda], the [set-value] slot targets all sibling nodes named [.result] and sets their value to "OK".
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Ensuring that a specific status node [.result] is updated to "OK" when a condition is true.
 * - Resetting or marking result nodes in a workflow after a successful operation.
 * - Initializing a result flag in a process when entering a valid state.
 * - Triggering a status update in response to a specific validation passing.
