/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot checks if the node(s) specified by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/ArtistId` exist and have a value. If any [ArtistId] node under any child of [.arguments] is missing or has a null value, the slot throws an exception, preventing further execution.
 * 2. This ensures that [ArtistId] is a required argument for the operation, enforcing input validation at the start of the logic.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Enforcing that an [ArtistId] is provided when creating or updating an artist record in an API endpoint.
 * - Validating user input in a form submission where [ArtistId] is a required field.
 * - Preventing accidental execution of business logic without the necessary [ArtistId] argument.
