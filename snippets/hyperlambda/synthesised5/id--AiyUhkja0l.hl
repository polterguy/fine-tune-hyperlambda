/*
 * 1. The [unwrap] slot with the expression `:x:+/**` is used to evaluate all descendant nodes of its next sibling, resolving any expressions so that dynamic values are injected into the email structure before sending.
 * 2. The [mail.smtp.send] slot sends an email using SMTP, building the email message dynamically. It defines the recipient in [to], the subject in [subject], and the body in [entity]/[content], all of which are populated from previously defined nodes [.recipient-email], [.email-subject], and [.email-body].
 * 3. The [to] node uses an object structure with an [email] child, enabling dynamic recipient assignment via the expression `:x:@.recipient-email`.
 * 4. The email subject and body are also injected dynamically using expressions that reference the corresponding nodes.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Sending transactional emails where recipient, subject, and body are generated at runtime, such as notifications or alerts.
 * - Implementing a contact form handler that forwards user-submitted content to a specified email address.
 * - Automating personalized messages to a list of recipients, with content determined by workflow logic.
 * - Integrating with other workflows to send templated emails based on user actions or events.
