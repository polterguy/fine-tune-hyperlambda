/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used here to add new child nodes to each node referenced by the expression `:x:../*/return-nodes/0/-/*/columns`.
 * 2. The child node being added is a node with its value set dynamically using the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/name`, which means it takes the value of the [name] child node of the currently iterated [.dp] node (passed by reference in a [for-each] context).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically populating a [columns] node for each return node in a data structure, using the [name] value from another part of the tree.
 * - Building or extending a schema or metadata section for each result set in a batch operation.
 * - Automating the generation of column definitions in a data transformation or ETL process.
