/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates through all child nodes of [.list] whose value is "match", passing each matched node by reference into a [.dp] node in the lambda block.
 * 2. The [set-value] slot sets the value of each currently iterated node (referenced through [.dp]) to "found", replacing the original value "match" with "found".
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Update only items in a list that meet a certain condition (e.g., status is "match") to a new value.
 * - Mark specific entries in a dataset as processed or found based on their values.
 * - Perform batch updates on filtered nodes in a collection without affecting other nodes.
 * - Transform selected nodes for further processing or reporting based on their initial value.
