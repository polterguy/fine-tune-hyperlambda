/*
 * 1. The [pgsql.connect] slot establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database named [accounts], making all database operations within its scope execute against this database.
 * 2. The [pgsql.delete] slot is used to perform a SQL DELETE operation on the [users] table. It will only delete records where the [id] column is equal to 1001, as specified in the [where] clause using the [and] logical operator and the [id.eq] comparison.
 * 3. The [yield] slot is then used to return a response, with a [message] node indicating that the user was deleted successfully.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Remove a user record with a specific ID from the [users] table in the [accounts] PostgreSQL database.
 * - Build an API endpoint for user management that deletes users based on their ID and returns a confirmation message.
 * - Integrate administrative tools that automate user cleanup by ID and confirm successful deletion to the client.
 * - Enforce business logic that ensures only users with a given [id] are deleted, preventing accidental mass deletions.
