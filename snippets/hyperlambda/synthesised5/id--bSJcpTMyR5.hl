/*
 * 1. The [.x] node is created with an integer value of 3.
 * 2. The [mt] slot compares two arguments: the value retrieved from [.x] using [get-value], and the static integer value 5.
 * 3. [mt] will return true only if the value from [.x] is more than 5; otherwise, it returns false.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Checking if a user's score stored in [.x] surpasses a threshold of 5.
 * - Validating if a counter in [.x] has exceeded a specific limit before triggering an action.
 * - Comparing dynamic input against a hardcoded value for decision-making in a workflow.
 * - Filtering data where only values greater than 5 should be processed further.
