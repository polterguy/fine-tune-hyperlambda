/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to read records from the table specified in the [table] node, in this case [table1].
 * 2. The [where] node sets a filtering condition for the data selection.
 * 3. The [and] slot inside [where] allows you to combine multiple conditions, but here it contains a single condition.
 * 4. The [column1.eq:null] node specifies that only records where the [column1] column value is NULL will be returned.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Retrieve all rows from [table1] where [column1] has not been assigned a value.
 * - Find records with missing or incomplete data in [column1].
 * - Useful for validation checks to identify data gaps in [table1].
 * - Can be used as part of a data cleaning or auditing process to locate NULL values.
