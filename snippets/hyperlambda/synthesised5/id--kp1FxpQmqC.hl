/*
 * 1. The [.textX] node is created with the value "plain" and no explicit type declaration, so it defaults to a string.
 * 2. The [.textY] node is created with a quoted string value "url:path", using double quotes to encapsulate the colon character.
 * 3. The [.textZ] node uses the @ symbol before the opening double quote, making it a verbatim multi-line string, with the value "start\nend".
 * 4. The [.textR] node is a string containing an explicit escaped newline sequence "\n", resulting in a value with a line break.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Storing and manipulating different string formats, including plain, multi-line, and strings with special characters or escape sequences.
 * - Preparing text values for downstream processing, such as serializing, storing, or using in expressions requiring specific formatting.
 * - Demonstrating the various ways string values can be assigned in Hyperlambda, including verbatim multi-line and escaped-character representations.
