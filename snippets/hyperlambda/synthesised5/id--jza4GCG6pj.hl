/*
 * 1. The [insert-before] slot is used to insert new nodes directly before a specified node or set of nodes within a parent node.
 * 2. In this code, [insert-before] targets the [log1] node within the [.logs] node, as specified by the expression `:x:@.logs/*/log1`.
 * 3. The child node to insert is an unnamed node containing a [log0] node with the value "Previous log entry".
 * 4. After execution, the [log0] node is added before the [log1] node inside [.logs], effectively updating the order of child nodes.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Prepending a new log entry to a log list so that the newest entry appears before existing ones.
 * - Inserting configuration steps or items before a known point in a sequence without modifying all later nodes.
 * - Ensuring that prerequisite nodes are present before specific nodes in a workflow or data structure.
 * - Reordering elements within a parent node by programmatically inserting new elements at precise positions.
