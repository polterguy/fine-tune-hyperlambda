/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to read data from a database table, in this case from the [Professor] table.
 * 2. The [table] argument specifies the name of the table to query, here set to [Professor].
 * 3. The [limit] argument restricts the number of records returned to 50, preventing large result sets.
 * 4. The [columns] node lists the specific columns to retrieve from the table, in this case [ProfessorId] and [LastName], ensuring only these fields are included in the result.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve the first 50 professors' IDs and last names for display in a web application.
 * - Export a paged list of professors with minimal data for reporting or integration.
 * - Populate a dropdown or autocomplete field with professor names and IDs for user selection.
