/*
 * 1. The [include] slot is used to execute the children nodes of the [data.read] node and include their results in the current execution context.
 * 2. The [data.read] slot is used to query the [Shipment] table in the database, selecting only the [ShipmentId] and [DispatchDate] columns.
 * 3. The [where] clause filters the results to only include rows where the [WarehouseId] column matches the value found at the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/WarehouseId`.
 * 4. The [yield] slot returns the results of the [data.read] operation as a node named [shipments], containing all the records retrieved.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve all shipments for a specific warehouse, where the warehouse ID is dynamically determined from the current execution context.
 * - Include shipment data as part of a larger workflow, such as generating a report or processing warehouse-related tasks.
 * - Return a filtered list of shipments to an API consumer based on the warehouse associated with the current data processing node.
