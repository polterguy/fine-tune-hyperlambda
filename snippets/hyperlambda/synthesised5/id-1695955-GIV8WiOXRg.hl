/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.sql] node with the result of a concatenation operation.
 * 2. The [strings.concat] slot combines the current value of the [.sql] node, the string " offset ", and the value of the [offset] node found in [.arguments] into a single string.
 * 3. [get-value] is used twice: first to fetch the existing value of [.sql] and second to retrieve the value of the [offset] argument provided in [.arguments].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Appending an OFFSET clause to a dynamically constructed SQL query stored in [.sql] for pagination.
 * - Modifying a SQL statement with user-supplied offset values in an API endpoint that supports data paging.
 * - Dynamically updating a query string in preparation for sending to a database adapter.
 * - Creating database access layers where SQL components are built step by step from different user or system inputs.
