/*
 * 1. The [eq] slot compares two values to check if they are exactly the same.
 * 2. The first argument to [eq] uses [get-value] with the expression `:x:../*/.foo1`, which retrieves the value of all [.foo1] nodes at the same level as the current node.
 * 3. The second argument is a static string value [.]:OK, which is compared to the retrieved value(s).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To validate that multiple sibling nodes named [.foo1] all have the value "OK".
 * - To implement conditional logic that only triggers when a status or flag node equals a specific value.
 * - To check if initialization or configuration nodes have the expected value before proceeding with an operation.
 * - As part of a test or assertion in a unit testing scenario for Hyperlambda logic.
