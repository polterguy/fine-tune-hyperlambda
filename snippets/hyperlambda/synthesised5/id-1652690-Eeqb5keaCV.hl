/*
 * 1. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple conditions, ensuring that all child conditions must evaluate to true for the [and] slot itself to return true.
 * 2. The [CustomerId.eq] node applies the equality comparison operator to the [CustomerId] field, checking if its value is equal to the value retrieved from the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/CustomerId`. This is typically used in SQL-related slots to generate a "CustomerId = @value" condition.
 * 3. The expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/CustomerId` navigates to the [CustomerId] node within the referenced [.dp] node, which is often used in loops or data processing to refer to the current item.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Filtering database records to only include those where the [CustomerId] matches a specific value from another node.
 * - Constructing a WHERE clause in a SQL query to ensure only rows with a matching [CustomerId] are affected.
 * - Validating that the [CustomerId] of a current data item matches a required value before proceeding with further logic.
