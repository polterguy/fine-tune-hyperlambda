/*
 * 1. The [io.stream.open-file] slot is used to open a file and return a raw stream object as its value, rather than the file's content.
 * 2. The file path to open is dynamically constructed using the [strings.concat] slot, and the result of this concatenation is passed as the file path argument to [io.stream.open-file].
 * 3. The use of `:x:@strings.concat/@strings.concat` as the expression means the code is referencing the result of a [strings.concat] operation, potentially nested, to determine the file path at runtime.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically open a file whose path is built from multiple string segments at runtime.
 * - Handle file streams for files with names or paths generated from user input or other logic.
 * - Prepare a file stream for further processing, such as reading, streaming to HTTP responses, or zipping, when the file location is not statically known.
