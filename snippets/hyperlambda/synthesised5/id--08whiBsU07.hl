/*
 * 1. The [strings.starts-with] slot checks if the value of its first argument, in this case "HelloWorld", begins with the sequence of characters specified in its child node, which here is "World".
 * 2. The child node [.], containing "World", is compared against the start of the "HelloWorld" string to determine if it is a prefix.
 * 3. The result of this operation will be a boolean value: true if "HelloWorld" starts with "World", otherwise false.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To validate if a filename starts with a specific prefix before processing.
 * - To filter a list of user input strings by those that begin with a certain keyword or phrase.
 * - To implement custom logic for handling routes or commands that must start with a fixed string in a configuration or automation scenario.
