/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@.sql`. The `@.sql` expression points to the first node named [.sql] found in the current scope or among its ancestors and siblings.
 * 2. This operation extracts the data or content stored in the [.sql] node, making it available for further processing or as an output value.
 * 3. [get-value] is often used when you need to work directly with the value held by a node, rather than the node object itself.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Obtaining the SQL query string stored in [.sql] before executing it with a database-related slot.
 * - Passing the value of [.sql] as an argument to another slot that requires a SQL statement.
 * - Checking or logging the SQL command generated elsewhere in the workflow for debugging or auditing purposes.
