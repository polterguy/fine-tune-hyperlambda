 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the node referenced by the expression `@.arguments/0/#` to a new value.
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the [crypto.password.hash] node and provides it as the new value for the target node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Assigning the result of a password hashing operation to an argument node, such as when storing a hashed password for later verification.
 * - Updating a parameter or variable in the execution context with the output of a cryptographic hash operation.
 * - Passing the hashed password value to another process or function by setting it on a specific argument node.
