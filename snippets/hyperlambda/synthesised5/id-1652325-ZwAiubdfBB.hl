/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to broadcast a SignalR event named "crm.leads.post" to connected clients.
 * 2. The [roles] node specifies that only users with the "admin" or "root" roles will receive this event.
 * 3. The [args] node is present but empty, meaning no additional data is sent with the event.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Notify all administrators and root users in real time when a new lead is posted in a CRM system.
 * - Trigger client-side updates or alerts for privileged users when certain actions occur.
 * - Implement access-controlled real-time notifications for sensitive operations.
