/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks a condition, and if it evaluates to false, it does not execute its [.lambda] child.
 * 2. The [else-if] slot follows the [if] as a sibling, and is evaluated only if all previous [if] and [else-if] conditions were false. Its condition is checked, and if true, its [.lambda] child is executed.
 * 3. The [set-value] slot inside each [.lambda] sets the value of the [.result] node based on which branch is taken.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Implementing multi-branch decision logic, such as mapping user roles to permissions.
 * - Setting a result or status value based on a sequence of conditional checks, like form validation outcomes.
 * - Creating fallback logic, where only one of several possible actions should be triggered depending on input conditions.
 * - Handling alternative business rules where only the first true condition's effect is needed.
