/*
 * 1. The [validators.recaptcha] slot checks the value of each [.recaptcha_value] node found by the `:x:@.arguments/*/recaptcha_value` expression, ensuring it is a valid response from Google's reCAPTCHA v3 service.
 * 2. The [site-key] child node sets the site key as required by the Google reCAPTCHA configuration.
 * 3. The [secret] child node provides the secret key for server-side verification with Google.
 * 4. The [min] child node sets a minimum score threshold (0.3 in this case), requiring the reCAPTCHA response to meet or exceed this value to be considered valid.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Protecting a registration form from automated bots by verifying reCAPTCHA responses before processing user input.
 * - Validating comment submissions on a public-facing website to reduce spam and abuse.
 * - Securing contact or feedback forms, ensuring only submissions with a sufficient reCAPTCHA score are accepted.
