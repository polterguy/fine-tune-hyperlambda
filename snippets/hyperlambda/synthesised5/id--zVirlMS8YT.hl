/*
 * 1. The [mail.pop3.fetch] slot is used to fetch emails from a POP3 server. In this usage, since no explicit [server] configuration is provided, connection settings such as host, port, security, username, and password will be retrieved from default configuration values if present.
 * 2. The [.lambda] node is a callback that executes for each email message fetched. For each message, this lambda will receive a [.message] node containing the structured (parsed) contents of the email.
 * 3. Inside [.lambda], the [log.info] slot is used to log information. The argument to [log.info] is produced by [lambda2hyper:x:./.], which serializes the current lambda node (including the fetched message structure) into a Hyperlambda string representation for logging.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Log the full Hyperlambda structure of every incoming email for auditing or debugging purposes.
 * - Inspect the raw message hierarchy of received emails to help with email parsing or troubleshooting.
 * - Archive the exact structure of each fetched email as Hyperlambda text for later processing or replay.
