/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to read data from a database table. In this case, it is configured to interact with a SQLite database.
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies the type of database as SQLite, ensuring the correct SQL dialect is used.
 * 3. The [table] node sets the target table to [Doctors], meaning the query will operate on this table.
 * 4. The [columns] node includes a single aggregate column, [count(*)], which is aliased as [count]. This means the query will return the total number of records in the [Doctors] table.
 * 5. The [where] node contains an [and] node, but no conditions are specified, so no filtering is applied and all records are counted.
 * 6. The [limit] node is set to 1, which restricts the result set to a single row, though aggregate functions like count(*) typically return only one row by default.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve the total number of doctors in the [Doctors] table for reporting or dashboard purposes.
 * - Check if there are any records in the [Doctors] table before performing further operations.
 * - Display the count of doctors as a summary statistic in an application interface.
