/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the node(s) matched by the expression `:x:@.fields`. 
 * 2. The `@.fields` part of the expression selects the first node named [.fields] in the current execution context. 
 * 3. The result is the direct value stored in the [.fields] node, without evaluating or traversing any child nodes.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the value of a [.fields] node that contains a configuration string or identifier for further processing.
 * - Reading input data from a previously created [.fields] node before performing validation or transformation.
 * - Returning the value of [.fields] as the output of a dynamic slot or HTTP endpoint.
