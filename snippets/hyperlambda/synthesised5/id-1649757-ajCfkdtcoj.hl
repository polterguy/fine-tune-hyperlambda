/*
 * 1. The [tasks.get] slot retrieves information about a specific task. The task ID is dynamically resolved using the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/id`, which means it fetches the value of the [id] node from the current [.dp] node's children.
 * 2. The [schedules] argument is set to true, instructing [tasks.get] to also return all schedules associated with the specified task, in addition to the task's Hyperlambda and description.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Inspecting the full configuration and schedule details of a task when you have the task ID stored in a referenced node.
 * - Dynamically retrieving task and schedule information as part of a workflow that processes multiple tasks.
 * - Auditing or displaying detailed task and schedule data in an administrative dashboard.
