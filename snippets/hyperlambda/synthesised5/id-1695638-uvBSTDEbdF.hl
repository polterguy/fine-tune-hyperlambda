/*
 * 1. The [neq] slot compares the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/prefix-url` with an empty value (null or empty string).
 * 2. If the value of the [prefix-url] node inside [.arguments] is not null or not an empty string, the [neq] slot will return true.
 * 3. This logic can be used to check whether the [prefix-url] argument was provided and has a non-empty value during endpoint invocation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring a required URL prefix argument is not omitted or left empty in an API call.
 * - Conditional logic to perform URL manipulations only if [prefix-url] is present.
 * - Validating user input to enforce mandatory fields in forms.
