/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@.sql`. This means it looks for the first node named [.sql] in the current context and returns its value.
 * 2. The expression `@.sql` specifically searches for the first occurrence of a node named [.sql] relative to where the [get-value] is executed.
 * 3. The result of this operation will be the value stored in the [.sql] node, which could be a string, number, or any supported Hyperlambda type.
 * 4. This slot is useful for dynamically extracting data from previously created or manipulated nodes, especially in workflows where the value of [.sql] is generated or modified earlier in the execution tree.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the generated SQL query string after constructing it with [sql.*] slots for logging or debugging purposes.
 * - Passing the value of [.sql] to another slot that requires a raw SQL statement as input.
 * - Displaying the current SQL command to users for transparency or audit purposes.
 * - Using the retrieved value as part of further dynamic logic, such as conditionally executing different code paths based on the contents of [.sql].
