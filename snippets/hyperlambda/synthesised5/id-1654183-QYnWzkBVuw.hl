/*
 * 1. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple logical conditions, and will only return true if all its child conditions are true.
 * 2. The [finish_reason.eq] node applies the equality comparison operator to the [finish_reason] field, checking if its value is equal to "lead".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Filtering a dataset to only include entries where [finish_reason] is exactly "lead".
 * - Creating a conditional branch that executes logic only if [finish_reason] equals "lead".
 * - Constructing a SQL WHERE clause that selects records with [finish_reason] set to "lead".
