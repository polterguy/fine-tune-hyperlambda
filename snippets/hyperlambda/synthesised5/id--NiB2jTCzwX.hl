/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot checks that both [.arguments]/[arg1] and [.arguments]/[arg2] have been provided, ensuring required input validation before further processing.
 * 2. [math.modulo] computes the remainder when the value of [.arguments]/[arg1] is divided by [.arguments]/[arg2], using [get-value] to extract their integer values.
 * 3. [if] evaluates whether the result of [math.modulo] is exactly zero by using [eq], and if so, executes its [.lambda] branch.
 * 4. Within the [.lambda] branch of [if], [set-value] assigns boolean true to the [result] node under [../*/return/*], signaling that arg1 is evenly divisible by arg2.
 * 5. The [else] branch sets [result] to boolean false if the modulo is not zero, indicating arg1 is not evenly divisible by arg2.
 * 6. Finally, [return] returns the [result] node to the caller, encapsulating the outcome of the divisibility check.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Determine if a number is a multiple of another (e.g., check if 15 is divisible by 5).
 * - Implement input validation in API endpoints to ensure both values required for division are supplied.
 * - Enable conditional branching in business logic based on whether one value is divisible by another (such as eligibility checks).
 * - Automate rules or filters that depend on even/odd checks or divisibility (e.g., calendar scheduling for recurring events).
 * - Use in educational tools to demonstrate or test divisibility concepts in mathematics.
