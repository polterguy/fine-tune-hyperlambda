/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot opens a database connection to the [sakila] database using the [generic] connection string, and specifies the database type as SQLite with the [database-type] node.
 * 2. The [add] slot collects all argument nodes from [.arguments] and adds them as children to the [values] node under [data.create]. This dynamically builds the set of values to be inserted into the database.
 * 3. The [data.create] slot inserts a new record into the [address] table in the SQLite [sakila] database, using the values previously gathered.
 * 4. The [response.status.set] slot sets the HTTP response status to 201, indicating successful creation of a resource.
 * 5. The [yield] slot returns the ID of the newly created record from the [data.create] operation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating a new address record in the [sakila] database using dynamic input arguments.
 * - Building a REST API endpoint for inserting address data and returning the new record's ID.
 * - Ensuring the response status accurately reflects resource creation for client applications.
