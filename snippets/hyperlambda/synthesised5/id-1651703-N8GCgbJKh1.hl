 * 1. The [add] slot is used to add together the values of its children nodes or expressions. In this case, it will sum up the results provided by its children.
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all child nodes of the node referenced by the expression `@hyper2lambda/*`, which means it fetches all children of the [hyper2lambda] node.
 * 3. The [add] slot will then add together the values of all nodes returned by [get-nodes].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Summing all numeric child nodes produced by a [hyper2lambda] transformation, for example, if the parsed Hyperlambda text results in multiple nodes with numeric values.
 * - Aggregating results from dynamically generated Hyperlambda code, where the structure and number of nodes are not known in advance.
 * - Performing calculations on a set of values extracted from a lambda object created from Hyperlambda text.
