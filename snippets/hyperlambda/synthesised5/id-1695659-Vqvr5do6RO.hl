/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot is used to delete nodes from the current graph structure.  
 * 2. The expression `:x:@signal/*/*/db/=information_schema` targets all descendant nodes named [db] under any grandchild of [signal] whose value is exactly "information_schema".  
 * 3. When executed, all [db] nodes under any two-level descendant of [signal] that have the value "information_schema" are removed from the graph.  
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up configuration trees by removing database metadata references from [signal] nodes.
 * - Filtering out nodes related to the "information_schema" database before further processing or serialization.
 * - Sanitizing a data structure to exclude system database references before exporting.
 * - Preparing a Hyperlambda graph for user display by hiding internal or sensitive database information.
