/*
 * 1. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all nodes that match the expression `@data.read/*/*`. This expression navigates to the first node named [data.read], then selects all of its children, and then all of their children, effectively returning all grandchild nodes of [data.read].
 * 2. The result is a node set containing references to these grandchild nodes, which can be further processed or manipulated by subsequent slots.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting all nested data entries from a [data.read] node for further processing or transformation.
 * - Collecting all leaf nodes under a specific section of a data structure for validation or aggregation.
 * - Preparing a subset of nodes for iteration or export based on their hierarchical position within [data.read].
