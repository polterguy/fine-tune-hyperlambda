/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to read data from a database table, generating a SQL SELECT statement.
 * 2. The [table] node specifies the table to query, in this case [Warehouse].
 * 3. The [limit] node restricts the number of records returned to 50.
 * 4. The [columns] node lists the specific columns to return in the result set, here [WarehouseId] and [Location].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve the first 50 warehouse records with only their IDs and locations for display in a paginated UI.
 * - Export a limited list of warehouse locations for reporting or auditing purposes.
 * - Fetch a manageable subset of warehouse data to avoid overloading the client or server with large result sets.
