/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate multiple string values together into a single string. It takes its input from the result set specified by the expression `:x:@.sql`, which points to the children of the [.sql] node.
 * 2. [get-value] is used as the first argument inside [strings.concat]. It retrieves the value of the [.sql] node, providing the base part of the SQL statement.
 * 3. The next nodes are static string literals: " from ", "leads", and " where keyword_count > 0". These are appended together to build or extend a SQL query string.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically constructing a SQL SELECT statement by appending table and condition clauses to an existing SQL fragment.
 * - Generating a custom SQL query for reporting or data export based on the value of [.sql].
 * - Modifying or extending a previously defined SQL string before executing it in a database context.
 * - Reusing or chaining SQL statement components to create complex queries without hardcoding the full query in one place.
