/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is invoked with an expression `:x:@.fields`, which implies it will add the values of all nodes under the [.fields] node.
 * 2. A child node with no name but with a value `:x:@strings.concat` is provided, causing each value under [.fields] to be processed using the [strings.concat] slot before being added.
 * 3. [strings.concat] is used here to concatenate string values before the addition operation, ensuring that all input values are treated as concatenated strings before the math addition.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Summing up the results of several string concatenation operations stored as children under [.fields].
 * - Aggregating multiple dynamically generated string values that need to be combined as a single sum.
 * - Creating a total from several fields where each field may itself be formed by concatenating other strings first.
 * - Useful in data transformation pipelines where string assembly and numeric addition are both required.
