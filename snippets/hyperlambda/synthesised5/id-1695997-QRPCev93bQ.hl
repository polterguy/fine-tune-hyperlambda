/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot initiates a database read operation, specifically targeting a SQLite database as indicated by the [database-type] node set to "sqlite".
 * 2. The [table] node specifies that the primary table for the query is [Orders], and two [join] nodes are used to perform left joins: one to the [Employees] table (aliased as [EmployeeID]), and another to the [Shippers] table (aliased as [ShipVia]).
 * 3. Each [join] node contains a [type] specifying a left join, an [as] node for aliasing, and an [on] node with [and] conditions that define the join criteria using column equality (e.g., [Orders.EmployeeID] equals [EmployeeID.EmployeeID]).
 * 4. The [columns] node specifies a single column, [aggregate_functor], which is aliased as [result], indicating the use of an aggregate function whose result will be labeled "result" in the output.
 * 5. The [where] node with [and] currently contains no conditions, meaning no additional filtering is applied to the result set.
 * 6. The [limit] node restricts the query to return only one row.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve a single aggregated value (such as a count, sum, or other aggregate function) from the [Orders] table, combining related employee and shipper information through left joins.
 * - Display summary statistics that include information from related tables even when some orders may not have matching employees or shippers.
 * - Generate reports where you need to join multiple tables and aggregate the results, limiting the output to a single row for concise dashboards.
 * - Support data analysis scenarios where joining auxiliary tables and retrieving an aggregate is necessary for business intelligence or analytics applications.
