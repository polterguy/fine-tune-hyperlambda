/*
 * 1. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple logical conditions, ensuring all must be true for the overall condition to be true.
 * 2. The [CustomerId.eq] node applies an equality comparison on the [CustomerId] field, checking if its value is equal to the value obtained from the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/CustomerId`.
 * 3. The expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/CustomerId` navigates to the [CustomerId] node within the referenced [.dp] node, retrieving its value for comparison.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Filtering a dataset to only include records where the [CustomerId] matches a specific value from another node.
 * - Constructing a SQL [where] clause to select or update records with a matching [CustomerId].
 * - Validating that a given [CustomerId] in the current context is identical to a [CustomerId] from a referenced data structure.
