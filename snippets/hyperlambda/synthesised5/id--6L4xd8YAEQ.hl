/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot is used twice to retrieve the values of [.a] and [.b].
 * 2. The [eq] slot compares the values obtained from [.a] and [.b] for strict equality.
 * 3. [.a] is defined as a string value "5", whereas [.b] is defined as an integer value 5.
 * 4. The result of [eq] will only be true if both the value and the type match exactly.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To check if two nodes with potentially different types but similar values are strictly equal.
 * - To validate user input by comparing it against a known typed value.
 * - To enforce type-sensitive logic in a workflow, such as distinguishing between string and integer representations of numbers.
