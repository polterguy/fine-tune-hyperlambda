/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node(s) referenced by its expression.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/CustomerId` navigates from the current node to the [.dp] node, de-references its value as a node (using `#`), accesses all its children (`*`), and then selects the [CustomerId] node among those children.
 * 3. The result is the value of the [CustomerId] node that is a child of the node referenced by the value of [.dp].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the customer ID from a data node passed by reference in a [for-each] loop.
 * - Accessing a specific property ([CustomerId]) from a complex data structure during iteration or processing.
 * - Retrieving a unique identifier for further processing, such as filtering or updating records.
