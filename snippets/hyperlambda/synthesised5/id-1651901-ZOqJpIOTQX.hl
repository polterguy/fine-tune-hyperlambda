/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks a condition and executes its child lambda if the condition is true.
 * 2. The [eq] slot compares the value of the [databaseName] node inside [.arguments] to the string "magic".
 * 3. If the comparison is true, the [.lambda] child executes, which contains a [throw] slot that raises an exception with the message "You cannot create a database with the name of magic since it is a restricted name".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Preventing users from creating a database with the reserved name "magic".
 * - Enforcing naming restrictions for database creation operations.
 * - Providing a clear error message when a restricted database name is used.
