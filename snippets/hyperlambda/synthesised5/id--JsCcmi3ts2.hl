/*
 * 1. The [if] slot is used to create a conditional branch, where its condition checks if the value of [.src] is equal to 1.
 * 2. The [eq] slot performs the equality comparison between the value of [.src] (retrieved via [get-value]) and the integer 1.
 * 3. The [set-value] slot assigns the value "OK" to any node named [.result] found among the siblings of the current node, but only if the condition is met.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating input fields and setting a status node to "OK" when a specific value is detected.
 * - Triggering a specific workflow if a configuration value matches an expected integer.
 * - Dynamically updating a result node in response to particular data conditions during execution.
 * - Implementing straightforward conditional logic for decision points in a Hyperlambda-based process.
