/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot initiates a read operation from a database, in this case specifying the database type as SQLite using the [database-type] argument.
 * 2. The [table] node specifies that the query will target the [categories] table.
 * 3. The [columns] node lists the specific columns to retrieve from the [categories] table: [categories.id], [categories.name], and [categories.description].
 * 4. The [where] node, with an [and] child, sets up the structure for filtering the results based on one or more conditions, although no actual conditions are defined in this snippet.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve a list of all categories from a SQLite database, displaying their IDs, names, and descriptions.
 * - Serve as a base template for a filtered query, where conditions can be added under the [and] node to narrow down the results.
 * - Provide data for a categories overview page in an application, showing all available categories with their details.
