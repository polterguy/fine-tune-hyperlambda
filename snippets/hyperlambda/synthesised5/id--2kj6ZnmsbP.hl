/*
 * 1. The [slots.create] slot is used to define a new dynamic slot named [generate.config]. Inside this slot, the [return-nodes] slot is invoked to return a structured set of nodes when the slot is called. Specifically, it creates a [config] node containing two children: [retry] (with an integer value of 3) and [timeout] (with an integer value of 30).
 * 2. The [execute] slot then executes the [generate.config] slot, triggering the return of the [config] node structure as the result of the execution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Providing a default configuration object for other parts of the application to consume.
 * - Centralizing configuration values such as retry attempts and timeouts for consistent use across multiple components.
 * - Dynamically modifying or regenerating configuration settings at runtime by updating the logic inside [generate.config].
 * - Testing or mocking configuration retrieval in development or automated tests.
