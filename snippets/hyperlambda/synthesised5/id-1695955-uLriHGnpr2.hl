/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates over each child node of [.words], passing the current node by reference in [.dp].
 * 2. For every node processed, [set-value] updates the value of the current node (using `@.dp/#`) to the result of [strings.to-lower], which converts its text to lowercase.
 * 3. [strings.to-lower] takes the current nodeâ€™s value (again referenced by `@.dp/#`) and transforms all characters to lowercase before assignment.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Standardizing all words in a list to lowercase before further processing, such as for case-insensitive comparison.
 * - Preparing user input for normalization before storing to a database.
 * - Converting keywords or tags to lowercase in a tagging system for consistency.
 * - Cleaning up imported data where casing may vary between entries.
