 * 1. The [return] slot is used to return a value from the current execution context, such as from an HTTP endpoint or a dynamic slot.
 * 2. The [sql] slot is referenced via the expression `:x:@.sql`, which means it will retrieve the value of the [.sql] node from the current lambda object and return it as the result.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning the generated SQL statement from a previous [sql.*] operation for debugging or inspection.
 * - Providing the generated SQL to a client or another service for review before execution.
 * - Exposing the SQL string in a REST API endpoint for educational or logging purposes.
