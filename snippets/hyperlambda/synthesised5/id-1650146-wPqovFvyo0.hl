/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to select records from a database table.
 * 2. The [table] node specifies that the query targets the [employees] table.
 * 3. The [columns] node with a [birth_day] child indicates that only the [birth_day] column should be returned in the result set.
 * 4. The [where] node defines the filtering condition for the query.
 * 5. The [and] node allows for one or more conditions to be combined; here, it contains a single condition.
 * 6. The [username.eq] node specifies that the [username] column must equal the value referenced by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/username`, which dynamically retrieves the [username] argument from the input.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve the birth date of a specific employee by providing their username.
 * - Validate or display an employee's birth date in a user profile section based on their username.
 * - Use as part of an authentication or verification process where the employee's birth date is required.
