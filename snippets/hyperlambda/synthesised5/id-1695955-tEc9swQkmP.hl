/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates the values of its child nodes into a single string, without any separator between them.
 * 2. The first child node uses an expression `:@p`, which will resolve to the value of the node named [p] and include its value in the concatenation.
 * 3. The second child node is a [get-value] slot with the expression `:x:@.no`, which retrieves the value of the node named [.no] and adds it to the concatenated result.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Merging a parameter value [p] and a counter [.no] into a single string for generating unique IDs.
 * - Concatenating dynamic input (from [p]) with a numeric suffix ([.no]) to produce a composite label or code.
 * - Combining user-supplied data and sequential numbers for filenames or tokens.
