/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node declares an input [age] of type int, which will be used as the parameter for the logic.
 * 2. The [if] slot checks whether the value of [age] is more than 17 by using the [mt] slot with the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/age` compared to 17.
 * 3. If the condition is true (age > 17), the [.lambda] block is executed and a [return] node is produced with [is_grownup] set to true.
 * 4. If the condition is false (age <= 17), the outer [return] node executes, setting [is_grownup] to false.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Determine if a user is legally considered an adult based on their age input.
 * - Gate access to certain features or content by checking if the [age] provided qualifies as "grown up."
 * - Validate form submissions where only users above a certain age threshold should proceed.
 * - Conditionally branch application logic depending on whether a person is over 17 years old.
