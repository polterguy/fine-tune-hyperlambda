/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node(s) referenced by its expression.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/ArtistId` navigates to the [.dp] node, dereferences its value (which is a node reference), gets all its children, and then selects the [ArtistId] node(s) among those children.
 * 3. The result is the value(s) of the [ArtistId] node(s) that are children of the node referenced by [.dp].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the [ArtistId] value from a data node passed by reference in a [for-each] loop.
 * - Accessing a specific identifier from a nested data structure for further processing.
 * - Retrieving related entity IDs when iterating over a collection of parent nodes.
