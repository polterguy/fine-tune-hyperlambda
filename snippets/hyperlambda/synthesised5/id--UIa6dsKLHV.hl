/*
 * 1. The [execute-file] slot executes the external Hyperlambda file located at "/modules/greet.hl", treating it as a function call and passing arguments to it.
 * 2. The [name] node provides a string argument ("John Doe") to the executed file, accessible as an input within [./modules/greet.hl].
 * 3. The [age] node specifies an integer value (30) as an argument, allowing the file to process or use this value as needed.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically invoking reusable logic (such as a greeting or user profile generator) from another Hyperlambda file with varying input parameters.
 * - Passing user-submitted data (like username and age) to a backend process defined in a separate file for processing or validation.
 * - Structuring applications by separating endpoint logic from business logic, enabling modular code and easier maintenance.
 * - Automating workflows where different data sets are processed by the same logic with different arguments.
