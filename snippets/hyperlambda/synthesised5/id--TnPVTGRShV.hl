/*
 * 1. The [image.convert] slot is used to convert an image from one format to another.  
 * 2. The [file] node specifies the input path of the image to be converted.  
 * 3. The [output] node indicates the destination path and filename for the converted image.  
 * 4. The image will be read from the [file] path, processed, and saved in the format determined by the [output] path's extension (in this case, WebP).  
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Converting PNG product images to WebP for improved website load times.
 * - Automating format changes for image assets in a build pipeline.
 * - Generating different image versions for device compatibility.  
 * - Preparing images for use in platforms that require specific formats.  
 * - Batch conversion of images for archival or optimization purposes.
