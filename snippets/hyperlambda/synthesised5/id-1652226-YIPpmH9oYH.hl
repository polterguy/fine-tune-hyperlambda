/*
 * 1. The [data.delete] slot is used to delete records from a database table.
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies the type of database being used, in this case [sqlite].
 * 3. The [table] node indicates the target table for the delete operation, here [Order Details].
 * 4. The [where] node is used to define the condition(s) that determine which records will be deleted.
 * 5. The [and] node under [where] allows for combining multiple conditions, so that only records matching all specified criteria will be deleted.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Deleting specific records from the [Order Details] table in a SQLite database based on multiple conditions.
 * - Removing all order details for a particular order and product by specifying conditions under [and].
 * - Cleaning up test or obsolete data in the [Order Details] table by providing appropriate [where] conditions.
