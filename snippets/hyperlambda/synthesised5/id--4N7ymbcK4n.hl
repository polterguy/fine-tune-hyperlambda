/*
 * 1. The [if] node checks a condition, and evaluates its [.lambda] child node if the condition is true.
 * 2. The [or] slot is used to evaluate multiple boolean conditions; it returns true if any of its children evaluate to true.
 * 3. The [set-value] slot sets the value of all [.result] nodes in the parent scope to "OK" if the [if] condition is true.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Use this pattern to set a status flag when at least one of several conditions is met.
 * - Ideal for handling alternative success criteria in a workflow.
 * - Can be adapted to trigger notifications or actions if any of several monitored states become true.
 * - Useful in validating input where multiple acceptable values exist.
