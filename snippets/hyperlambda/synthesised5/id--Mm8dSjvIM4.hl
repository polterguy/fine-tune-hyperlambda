/*
 * 1. The [insert-after] slot is used to insert new nodes immediately after a node (or nodes) referenced in its main argument. In this case, it targets the [foo1] child of [.destination].
 * 2. The main argument `:x:@.destination/*/foo1` locates the [foo1] node under the [.destination] node.
 * 3. The node to be inserted, [foo2], with a value of "bar", is wrapped in an extra node as a child of the [insert-after] slot. This ensures [foo2] will be inserted immediately after [foo1].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Adding a new item into a specific position in a list, such as inserting a step into a workflow after a given step.
 * - Dynamically updating a configuration file by inserting new entries after existing ones.
 * - Modifying a data tree to append sibling nodes immediately after a matched node based on runtime conditions.
 * - Inserting HTML or XML elements immediately after specific tags during document transformation.
