/*
 * 1. The [include] slot executes the children of the [data.read] node and includes its results in the current execution context.
 * 2. The [data.read] slot queries the "Course" table, selecting the "CourseId" and "Title" columns.
 * 3. The [where] clause filters the results to only include courses where the "ProfessorId" column matches the value found at the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/ProfessorId`.
 * 4. The [yield] slot returns the results of the [data.read] operation as a node named [courses].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve all courses taught by a specific professor, where the professor's ID is dynamically determined from the context.
 * - Use as part of a larger workflow to fetch related course data for a given professor in a university management system.
 * - Include this logic in an HTTP endpoint to provide a list of courses for a professor profile page.
