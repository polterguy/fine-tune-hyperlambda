/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates multiple string values together into a single string. Here, it is combining the value of the [.sql] node, the literal string " offset ", and the value of the [offset] node located within [.arguments].
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the current value of the node specified by its expression, allowing dynamic construction based on the state of the execution tree.
 * 3. This pattern is typically used to dynamically build or extend a SQL query string by appending an OFFSET clause, using the current SQL fragment and an offset value provided as an argument.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Appending pagination logic to a dynamically generated SQL statement.
 * - Constructing database queries where the offset is user-defined or calculated at runtime.
 * - Building custom SQL strings for debugging or generating dialect-specific queries.
 * - Enhancing an existing SQL fragment in a modular way without manual string manipulation.
