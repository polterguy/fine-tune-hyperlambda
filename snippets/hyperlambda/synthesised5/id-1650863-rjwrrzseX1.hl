 * 1. The [else] node defines an alternative execution path that is triggered if the preceding [if] or [else-if] condition evaluates to false.
 * 2. The [throw] slot inside [else] raises an exception with the message "Something went wrong when invoking HTTP POST". This interrupts the normal flow of execution and signals an error condition.
 * 3. The exception thrown by [throw] can be caught by a [.catch] block if the code is wrapped in a [try] structure, or it will propagate up the call stack, potentially returning an error to the client if unhandled.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To handle failed HTTP POST requests by providing a clear error message when the operation does not succeed.
 * - To ensure that any unexpected result in an HTTP workflow triggers an exception, allowing for centralized error handling.
 * - To propagate errors to the client or logging system when a critical operation cannot be completed successfully.
