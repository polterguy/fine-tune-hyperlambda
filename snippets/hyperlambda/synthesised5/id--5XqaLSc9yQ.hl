/*
 * 1. The [image.chart] slot is invoked with the value "grouped", instructing the slot to generate a grouped bar chart.
 * 2. The [filename] node specifies the output file path as "/chart.png", which is where the resulting chart image will be saved.
 * 3. [width] and [height] define the dimensions of the chart image in pixels (600 by 300).
 * 4. The [bars] node organizes the bar groups by category: [Spring], [Summer], and [Autumn], each containing three integer values representing data points.
 * 5. The [legend] node provides descriptive labels ("Phones", "Computers", "Tablets") for each data series within the groups, aligning with the order of values under each season.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating a visual sales report by device type across different seasons and saving the result as an image file.
 * - Generating grouped bar charts to illustrate comparisons between categories for presentations or dashboards.
 * - Automatically exporting seasonal statistics in a visual format for email reports or documentation.
 * - Visualizing grouped data distributions for quick insights into trends and performance.
