/*
 * 1. The [set-name] slot renames all nodes matching the expression `@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column` to a new name provided by its child slot.
 * 2. [get-value] retrieves the value of the [.group_column] node from [.arguments], and supplies this as the new name for the nodes selected by [set-name].
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Dynamically renaming grouping columns in a SQL "group by" clause based on user input or API request arguments.
 * - Adjusting group column names in a generated data access layer to match external configuration or user preferences.
 * - Supporting flexible query structures where the grouping columns can be specified at runtime.
 * - Implementing customizable report builders where groupings are determined by client-side selections.
