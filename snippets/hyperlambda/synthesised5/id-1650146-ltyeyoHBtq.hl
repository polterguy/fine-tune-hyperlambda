 * 1. The [return] slot immediately exits the current execution context and returns its children nodes as the result of the execution.
 * 2. The [result] node is returned with a value of boolean true, indicating a successful or positive outcome.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To signal successful completion of an operation in a dynamic slot or endpoint.
 * - To provide a standardized boolean response to indicate the result of a validation or check.
 * - To short-circuit execution and return a fixed result from within a conditional branch.
