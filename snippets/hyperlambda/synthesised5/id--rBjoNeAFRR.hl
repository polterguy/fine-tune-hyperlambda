/*
 * 1. The code creates a node named [.whatever-node] without assigning any value or children to it.
 * 2. Since there is no value specified after the colon, the value of [.whatever-node] will be null.
 * 3. This node can be referenced by other slots using expressions, or have values or children added to it later in the execution graph.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Marking a placeholder in the execution tree to be updated or populated with data later.
 * - Serving as a flag node to indicate a condition or checkpoint within a workflow.
 * - Acting as a parent node to which dynamic children will be added during runtime.
 * - Being referenced by slots like [set-value] or [get-value] to assign or retrieve values at a later stage.
