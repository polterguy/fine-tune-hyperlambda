/*
 * 1. The [insert-after] slot is used to insert a new node into the graph structure immediately after an existing node specified by an expression.  
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.logs/*/log1` locates the [log1] node, which is a child of [.logs].  
 * 3. The child node of [insert-after] provides the content to be inserted, in this case a node with the value [log2] and its value "Next log entry".  
 * 4. This operation does not replace [log1], but adds [log2] as the next sibling node after [log1] under the [.logs] parent.  
 * 
 * Use cases:  
 * - Dynamically add new log entries immediately after an existing log item in a logging system.  
 * - Insert an item after a specific node in configuration or data lists without reconstructing the entire structure.  
 * - Build sequences of nodes where the order is significant, such as steps in a workflow or ordered menu items.  
 * - Augment result sets at runtime by inserting additional data points contextually after a found item.
