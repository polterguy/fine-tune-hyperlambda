/*
 * 1. The [math.multiply] slot multiplies all its child values. In this example, the base value is explicitly set to 4 via `math.multiply:int:4`.
 * 2. The first child of [math.multiply] is a static integer node with the value 3, contributing as a multiplication factor.
 * 3. The second child is a [math.add] slot, which sums two integer values, both set to 1, yielding a result of 2.
 * 4. [math.multiply] will calculate the product of 4, 3, and the result of [math.add] (which is 2), producing a final value of 24.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Quickly calculate a product where one operand is the result of a dynamic sum, such as determining a total price with a variable component.
 * - Chain multiple math operations to create formulas for finance or engineering calculations.
 * - Use as a building block for more complex logic, such as in a discount or tax calculation where factors are dynamically evaluated.
