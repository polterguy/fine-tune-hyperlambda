/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to add a new child node to all nodes matching the expression `:x:@data.connect/*/data.read/*/where/*/and`. This means it targets all [and] nodes that are descendants of [where], which in turn are descendants of [data.read], which are themselves descendants of [data.connect].
 * 2. The child node being added is an unnamed node (name is [.]), and it contains a child node [type.eq]. The [type.eq] node's value is set to the value of the [type] node found in [.arguments].
 * 3. The [type.eq] node is typically used in SQL query generation to add an equality comparison on the "type" column, matching it to the provided argument.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically inject a filter condition into all [and] conditions of a SQL query to restrict results by a specific "type" value.
 * - Programmatically enforce a type-based filter across multiple queries or query segments in a data access workflow.
 * - Add user-supplied or context-specific filtering to queries without manually editing each [and] clause.
