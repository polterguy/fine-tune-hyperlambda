 * 1. The [set-value] slot targets the [.sql] node, updating its value based on the result of the [strings.concat] slot.
 * 2. [strings.concat] constructs a new string by concatenating the current value of [.sql], the literal string ") * 1.0 / length(", the value from [.fields], and the string ") as keyword_density, (".
 * 3. [get-value] is used twice to extract the current values of [.sql] and [.fields], which are then merged into the concatenated result.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically appending a SQL calculation for keyword density to an existing SQL query string stored in [.sql].
 * - Generating parts of a SELECT statement where calculated columns are constructed based on field names held in [.fields].
 * - Modifying a stored SQL statement by injecting additional computed expressions before execution.
 * - Building complex SQL queries programmatically in a templated or iterative Hyperlambda process.
