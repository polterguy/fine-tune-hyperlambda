/*
 * 1. The [not-exists] slot checks whether the specified expression yields zero results. In this case, the expression is a dynamic string that references the [strings.split] node and its first child, and compares its value to the value of the [result] node's children.
 * 2. The expression uses interpolation to construct a query that looks for a child node under [result] whose value matches the value of the first child of [strings.split].
 * 3. If no such node exists under [result], [not-exists] will evaluate to true; otherwise, it will return false.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To verify that a particular split string value does not already exist in a result set before adding it.
 * - To prevent duplicate entries in a collection by checking for the absence of a value before insertion.
 * - To implement conditional logic that only executes if a specific value is not present in a given node set.
