/*
 * 1. The [image.resize] slot resizes an image file, with the input source specified by the [file] node, which in this case points to `/input.jpg`.
 * 2. The [width] and [height] nodes define the new target dimensions for the image, setting it to 300 pixels wide and 200 pixels high.
 * 3. Both dimensions are explicitly specified, so the image will be scaled to these exact values, potentially altering the original aspect ratio and causing stretching or squashing if the original proportions differ.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Standardizing all uploaded images to a fixed size for use in a website gallery, ensuring uniform appearance.
 * - Generating thumbnail images for faster page loading in an image catalog.
 * - Preparing product pictures for e-commerce listings where specific dimensions are required.
 * - Automating batch resizing of photos to fit into a predefined template or document.
