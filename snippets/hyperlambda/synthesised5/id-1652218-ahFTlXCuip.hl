/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to broadcast a SignalR event named "northwind.EmployeeTerritories.delete" to all connected clients subscribed to this event. 
 * 2. The [args] node is included as a child, but it is empty, meaning no additional arguments or payload are transmitted with the signal.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Notifying all clients in real-time that an EmployeeTerritories record has been deleted, so they can update their UI accordingly.
 * - Triggering client-side logic (such as refreshing a list or displaying a notification) when a deletion occurs in the EmployeeTerritories table.
 * - Coordinating distributed systems or microservices that need to react to deletions in the EmployeeTerritories entity.
