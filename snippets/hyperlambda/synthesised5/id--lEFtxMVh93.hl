/*
 * 1. The [image.resize] slot is used to resize an image.
 * 2. The [file] node specifies the source image file to be resized, in this case [file] points to "/input.jpg".
 * 3. No [width] or [height] node is given, which are required to determine the new image dimensions, so the operation as currently written will not perform a resize unless these are provided in the execution context.
 * 4. If the [type] node is provided, it determines the output image format; if not, the original format is kept.
 * 5. The operation can accept a [dest] node to specify an output file, or else returns the transformed image as a stream.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically resize uploaded user profile pictures to a standard size before saving.
 * - Reduce image dimensions for thumbnails in a web gallery.
 * - Batch process and standardize image sizes for content management systems.
 * - Prepare images for optimized web delivery by resizing and converting formats.
 * - Maintain image aspect ratios when only a new width or height is given.
