/*
 * 1. [get-value] retrieves the value from the node(s) referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it will locate the first node named [.fields] in the current context and return its value.
 * 2. The `:x:` part specifies that the argument is an expression, and `@.fields` tells Hyperlambda to look for a node named [.fields] at the same level or higher up in the hierarchy.
 * 3. This slot is typically used to extract the value from a specific node so it can be used in further processing, returned to a client, or assigned elsewhere.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching user input stored in a [.fields] node for validation or processing.
 * - Reading configuration or form data previously loaded or built in the execution context.
 * - Passing the value of [.fields] as an argument to another slot for further computations or actions.
 * - Logging or displaying the current value of [.fields] for debugging or audit purposes.
