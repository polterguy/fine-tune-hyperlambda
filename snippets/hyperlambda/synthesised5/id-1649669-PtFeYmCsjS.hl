/*
 * 1. The [http.get] slot performs an HTTP GET request to the specified URL, in this case "https://api.example.com/user/profile".
 * 2. The [convert] argument is set to true, which means the response will be automatically converted to the appropriate data type based on the returned content.
 * 3. The [headers] node allows you to specify custom HTTP headers for the request. Here, an [Authorization] header is set, with its value dynamically retrieved from the [.token] node using the expression `:x:@.token`.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching a user's profile information from a remote API that requires authentication via a bearer token.
 * - Integrating with a third-party service where the response needs to be parsed and converted automatically for further processing.
 * - Accessing protected resources in a microservices architecture by passing along an authorization token obtained from a previous authentication step.
