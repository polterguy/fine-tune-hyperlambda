/*
 * 1. The [data.select] slot is used here to execute an arbitrary SQL query, where the SQL statement is dynamically retrieved from the [.sql] node using the expression `:x:@.sql`.
 * 2. The [database-type] node is set to "sqlite", specifying that the SQL query should be executed against a SQLite database, regardless of any global or default database type settings.
 * 3. This approach enables dynamic execution of different SQL statements, as the actual query can be modified at runtime by changing the value of [.sql].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically generate SQL queries in [.sql] and execute them against a SQLite database for advanced reporting or analytics.
 * - Build a generic data access layer that can run any user-defined query, restricting execution to SQLite for security or compatibility.
 * - Implement a custom admin panel where administrators can run ad-hoc queries against a SQLite database by populating the [.sql] node.
