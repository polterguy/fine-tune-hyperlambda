/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot deletes all nodes referenced by the given expression.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@data.select/*/*/keyword_density` targets all [keyword_density] nodes that are grandchildren of [data.select].
 * 3. Any [keyword_density] nodes nested two levels deep under [data.select] will be removed from the lambda object structure.
 * 4. This operation is destructive for those nodes, meaning after execution, those [keyword_density] nodes and their values will no longer exist.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up specific calculated fields from a dataset before exporting or further processing.
 * - Removing sensitive or unnecessary information from query results prior to sending data to a client.
 * - Resetting or clearing cached analysis data (like keyword density) before running new computations.
 * - Enforcing data minimization policies by deleting non-essential nodes from a data structure.
