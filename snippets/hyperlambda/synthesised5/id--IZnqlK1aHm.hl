/*
 * 1. The [.config] node defines configuration settings for the database, specifically setting [.config/*/db/*/host] to "localhost" and [.config/*/db/*/port] to 5432.
 * 2. The [execute-file] slot runs the Hyperlambda file located at "/modules/db/connect.hl", passing in the [host] and [port] arguments. These arguments are not static but dynamically fetched from the [.config] node using expressions.
 * 3. The expressions `:x:@.config/*/db/*/host` and `:x:@.config/*/db/*/port` retrieve the corresponding values from the configuration structure, ensuring the connect module always uses the current configuration values at runtime.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically connecting to different databases by changing configuration values in [.config], without modifying business logic.
 * - Centralizing environment-specific settings (development, staging, production) in one place for easier management.
 * - Reusing the same connection logic ([/modules/db/connect.hl]) for multiple database hosts and ports by only altering the configuration.
 * - Simplifying deployment processes by letting scripts or admins update only the [.config] node according to the environment.
