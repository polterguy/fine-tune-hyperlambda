/*
 * 1. The [http.get] slot performs an HTTP GET request to the specified URL, retrieving a resource from "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/1". The [convert] argument is set to true, which means the response will be automatically parsed and converted into a Hyperlambda node structure if the response content type matches one of the registered converters (e.g., JSON).
 * 2. A new node named [.comment_body] is created, initially without a value.
 * 3. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.comment_body] node. It uses [get-value] with an expression that navigates to the [body] node within the parsed response, specifically at `@http.get/*/content/*/body`. This extracts the "body" property from the HTTP response content and assigns it as the value of [.comment_body].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Quickly fetch and extract a specific property (like a comment body) from a remote API response and store it in a local node for further processing.
 * - Integrate with external REST APIs, automatically parsing JSON responses and mapping relevant fields into your Hyperlambda workflow.
 * - Use as part of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to retrieve and transform data from external services into your application's data model.
 * - Facilitate debugging and logging by directly storing remote data fields into named nodes for later inspection or reporting.
