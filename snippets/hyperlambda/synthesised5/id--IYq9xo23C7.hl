/*
 * 1. The [.throws] node is initialized with the boolean value "false" to track if an exception has been thrown and caught.
 * 2. The [try] slot executes its child nodes, in this case a [throw] that triggers an exception with the message "foo".
 * 3. The [.catch] block is executed when the exception is thrown, containing a [set-value] slot, which sets the [.throws] node's value to boolean "true" to indicate the exception was successfully caught.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Testing exception handling logic to ensure that thrown exceptions are properly caught and handled.
 * - Setting flags (like [.throws]) in your workflow to indicate error states or transitions.
 * - Safely executing operations that may throw errors, while updating related nodes for error tracking or debugging.
 * - Demonstrating the interaction between [try], [throw], and [.catch] slots in a control flow scenario.
