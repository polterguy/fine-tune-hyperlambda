/*
 * 1. The [if] slot is used to conditionally execute a lambda object if the provided condition evaluates to true.
 * 2. The [and] slot combines multiple boolean conditions and only returns true if all child conditions are true.
 * 3. The [mt] slot checks if the value of [.num1] is greater than 3.
 * 4. The [lt] slot checks if the value of [.num2] is less than 10.
 * 5. The [set-value] slot assigns the string "Within bounds" to the [.check] node if all conditions are met.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating two numbers are within a specific range before proceeding with an operation.
 * - Gating further logic based on whether input values satisfy multiple constraints.
 * - Providing user feedback when inputs meet required numerical thresholds.
 * - Ensuring configuration values fall within acceptable bounds before saving settings.
