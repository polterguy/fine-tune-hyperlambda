/*
 * 1. The [mysql.connect] slot establishes a connection to a MySQL database using the connection information found at [.connection].
 * 2. The [mysql.select] slot executes a raw SQL query against the connected MySQL database. The query retrieves foreign key relationships for a specified table in the current schema, including the column name, referenced table name, referenced column name, and constraint name, filtered by the provided [@table] and [@database] arguments.
 * 3. The [return-nodes] slot returns all child nodes of the [mysql.select] node, effectively outputting the result set of the SQL query.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve all foreign key constraints for a specific table in a MySQL database, including details about referenced tables and columns.
 * - Generate metadata about table relationships for documentation or visualization purposes.
 * - Support dynamic schema exploration tools that need to display or analyze foreign key dependencies for a given table and database.
