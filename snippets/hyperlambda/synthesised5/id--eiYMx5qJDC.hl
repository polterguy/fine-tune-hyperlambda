/*
 * 1. [for-each] iterates over every child node of [.data], providing each node by reference via the [.dp] node during each iteration.
 * 2. [set-value] updates the value of the node currently referenced by [.dp] to "processed", overwriting any previous value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Marking each item in a collection as processed for tracking steps in a workflow.
 * - Resetting or normalizing values of a set of nodes before further processing.
 * - Preparing data for export by applying a uniform value to each entry.
 * - Flagging nodes in a batch operation for further conditional logic.
 * - Quickly overwriting existing values within a structured data segment.
