/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot is used here to concatenate a sequence of strings into a single string value. Its expression `:x:@.sql` points to a node named [.sql], and its children are concatenated in the order listed.
 * 2. [get-value] with `:x:@.sql` retrieves the value of the [.sql] node, which is included as the first part of the concatenated result.
 * 3. The node with name [.] and value `) as keyword_count` appends the literal string `) as keyword_count` to the sequence, finalizing the output string.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically appending an alias to a SQL aggregate function for use in a [columns] declaration.
 * - Creating a new column name in SQL output by combining an existing column or expression with an alias.
 * - Building custom SQL fragments or expressions for use in dynamic SQL generation scenarios.
 * - Wrapping a SQL expression and immediately aliasing it for easier result set handling.
