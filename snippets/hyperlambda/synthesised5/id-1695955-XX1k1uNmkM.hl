/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot is used to update the value of the [.sql] node with a new value, which is constructed by concatenating several string fragments.
 * 2. The [strings.concat] slot takes multiple string values as children and concatenates them together to form a single string. The result becomes the new value of [.sql].
 * 3. The [get-value] slot retrieves the current value of [.sql], ensuring the original SQL content is preserved and expanded upon.
 * 4. Literal string nodes such as [.:” from “], [. :CustomerDemographics], and [.:” where keyword_count > 0”] are appended to the SQL, creating a complete SQL statement segment.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Dynamically building or extending an SQL query by appending a FROM clause and a WHERE filter to an existing SQL string in [.sql].
 * - Useful in scenarios where an initial SQL SELECT statement is constructed earlier and additional clauses need to be joined based on user input or business logic.
 * - Can be used in a data access layer where SQL queries are composed in multiple steps to handle complex filtering or table joins.
 * - Enables flexible, programmatic construction of SQL statements before execution or debugging.
