/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks if the value of [.fileType] is equal to "json" by using the [eq] slot combined with [get-value] to retrieve the current value.
 * 2. If the condition is true (file type is "json"), the [response.headers.set] slot sets the HTTP response header [Content-Type] to "application/json".
 * 3. The [else] branch handles all other cases, setting the [Content-Type] header to "text/plain" using [response.headers.set].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically setting the HTTP response content type based on the requested file type.
 * - Ensuring endpoints correctly return JSON responses when appropriate, and plain text otherwise.
 * - Adapting API responses to client expectations without hard-coding the content type.
 * - Supporting both JSON and plain text downloads from the same endpoint based on user input or request parameters.
