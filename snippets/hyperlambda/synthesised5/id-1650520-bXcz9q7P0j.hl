/*
 * 1. [data.connect] opens a database connection using the "generic" connection string and the "magic" database, making database operations available to its child nodes.
 * 2. [add] collects all argument nodes from [.arguments] and adds them as children to the [values] node under [data.create], effectively mapping incoming request data to the database insert operation.
 * 3. [data.create] inserts a new record into the [ml_training_snippets] table using the dynamically constructed [values] node.
 * 4. [response.status.set] sets the HTTP response status code to 201, indicating successful creation of a resource.
 * 5. [yield] returns the ID of the newly created record from the [data.create] operation as the endpoint response.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating a new training snippet in the [ml_training_snippets] table using data sent in an HTTP POST request.
 * - Building a REST API endpoint for inserting new records into a database and returning the new record's ID.
 * - Handling dynamic input fields for database creation by mapping all incoming arguments directly to database columns.
