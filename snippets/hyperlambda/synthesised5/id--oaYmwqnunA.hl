/*
 * 1. The [.uploadLimit] node is being set up, likely to store the upload size limit for files.
 * 2. The [set-value] slot is used to assign a value to the [.uploadLimit] node. Its `:x:-` expression targets the previous sibling node, which is [.uploadLimit] itself.
 * 3. The [config.get] slot retrieves the configuration value for the key "files:upload:max-size" and provides this as the value to assign.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically loading the maximum allowed file upload size from configuration to enforce upload limits.
 * - Displaying the allowed upload size to users before they select files for upload.
 * - Ensuring server-side validation aligns with application configuration for file size restrictions.
 * - Allowing administrators to change upload limits in configuration without modifying code.
