/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot is used here to delete nodes from the current graph.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@signal/*/*/db/=tempdb` targets all [db] nodes that are children or grandchildren under [signal], with a value exactly equal to "tempdb".
 * 3. When executed, all nodes matching this path will be permanently removed from the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up temporary database connection nodes after running a workflow.
 * - Removing references to a specific database ([db] node with value "tempdb") from a collection of signal configurations.
 * - Ensuring that sensitive or obsolete connection information is deleted before exporting or persisting the node tree.
 * - Dynamically managing and pruning resource nodes in response to runtime changes or conditions.
