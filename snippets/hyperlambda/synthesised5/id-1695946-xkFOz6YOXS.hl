/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression provided in its value, in this case `:x:@.sql`. This means it will look for the first node named [.sql] at the same level or higher in the execution tree and return its value.
 * 
 * 2. The `:x:` prefix indicates that the argument is an expression and should be evaluated to resolve the node reference dynamically.
 * 
 * 3. This operation is commonly used to extract the value from a previously defined or computed node for further use, assignment, or conditional logic.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the result of a dynamically generated SQL statement stored in a [.sql] node to send as part of an HTTP response.
 * - Passing the value from [.sql] into another function or slot that requires the SQL statement as input.
 * - Logging or auditing the contents of [.sql] by retrieving its value for record-keeping or debugging purposes.
