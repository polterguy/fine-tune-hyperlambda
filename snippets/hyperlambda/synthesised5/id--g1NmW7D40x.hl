/*
 * 1. The [not-exists] slot checks whether the expression `:-/*` yields zero results. Here, `-` refers to the previous sibling node of [not-exists], which is [.dest], and `*` retrieves all children of [.dest].
 * 2. If [.dest] has no children, [not-exists] returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Verifying that a node, such as [.dest], is empty before performing an operation like insertion.
 * - Preventing duplicate entries by ensuring no children exist prior to adding new nodes.
 * - Checking for initialization status in a workflow by confirming the absence of child nodes under a parent node.
