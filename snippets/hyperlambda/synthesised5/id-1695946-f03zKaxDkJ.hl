/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.sql`. This means it will look for the first node named [.sql] at the same level or higher in the node hierarchy and return its value.
 * 2. Using the `@.sql` expression, [get-value] navigates to the corresponding node, regardless of whether it is a direct child or a sibling, and extracts only its value, not its children.
 * 3. The result of this operation is the direct value stored in the [.sql] node, which could be a string, number, or any other supported type.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the SQL query string from a [.sql] node to use it in a database operation.
 * - Reading configuration or connection information stored under a [.sql] node.
 * - Dynamically accessing a command or script value defined earlier in the execution tree for further processing.
