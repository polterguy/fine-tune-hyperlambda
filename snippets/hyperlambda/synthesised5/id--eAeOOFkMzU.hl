/*
 * 1. The [try] slot is used to attempt execution of its child nodes, providing structured exception handling.
 * 2. The [data.select] slot is invoked to run the SQL query `SELECT * FROM some_table`, which fetches all records from the specified table.
 * 3. The [.catch] node is a sibling to [try] and will execute its children if an exception occurs during the [try] block. Here, it writes a log entry via [log.error] indicating a failed query due to missing or invalid database connection.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Gracefully handling attempts to query a database when the connection is not established.
 * - Logging detailed error messages for failed database read operations.
 * - Wrapping potentially failing data access code to prevent application crashes and inform users or administrators of operational issues.
 * - Implementing robust error tracking in data access layers for debugging and auditing.
