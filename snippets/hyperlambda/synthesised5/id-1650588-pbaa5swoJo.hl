/*
 * 1. The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to at least one of the roles specified in its value, which in this case are "partner" and "client".
 * 2. If the user does not belong to either the "partner" or "client" roles, the slot throws an exception, effectively preventing further execution of the code for unauthorized users.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Restricting access to an HTTP endpoint so that only users with the "partner" or "client" roles can invoke it.
 * - Enforcing role-based authorization in business logic to ensure only specific user groups can perform certain actions.
 * - Protecting sensitive operations or data by allowing only users with the required roles to proceed.
