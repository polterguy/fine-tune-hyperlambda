/*
 * 1. The [response.headers.set] slot is used to explicitly set HTTP response headers for the outgoing response.
 * 2. The [Access-Control-Allow-Origin] header is set to "*", which allows cross-origin requests from any domain.
 * 3. The [Access-Control-Allow-Methods] header is set to "GET, POST, OPTIONS", specifying which HTTP methods are permitted for cross-origin requests.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Enabling CORS support on a Hyperlambda HTTP endpoint so that web applications from any origin can access the API.
 * - Allowing JavaScript clients to perform GET, POST, and OPTIONS requests from different domains without encountering CORS errors.
 * - Supporting preflight requests in browsers (using the OPTIONS method) for APIs that require CORS headers.
 * - Customizing security policies for specific endpoints depending on the required cross-origin interactions.
