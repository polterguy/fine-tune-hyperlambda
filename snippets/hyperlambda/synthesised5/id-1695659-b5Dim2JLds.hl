/*
 * 1. [add] inserts nodes into a parent node at a specific location in the graph, as determined by its expression.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@for-each/@for-each/@for-each/@.dp/#/*/tables/0/-` navigates deeply through the execution context, accessing three nested [for-each] scopes, de-referencing the currently iterated node in the innermost [for-each] with [.dp], retrieving all its children, filtering for the [tables] node, selecting its first child ([0]), then moving to the previous sibling with [-].
 * 3. The child node of [add], named [indexes], will be added as a child to the node found by the above expression.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically attach an [indexes] node to a specific place in a complex data graph, such as when processing nested table structures.
 * - Augment table definitions with index information after multiple levels of iteration (for example, while importing or transforming database schema metadata).
 * - Programmatically insert additional metadata or structural information at precise locations within a deeply nested node hierarchy during batch operations.
