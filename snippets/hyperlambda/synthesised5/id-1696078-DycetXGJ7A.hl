/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the node specified by the expression `:x:@.sql`, which means it looks for the first node named [.sql] in the current context and returns its value.
 * 2. The `:x:` prefix indicates that the argument is an expression, not a static value, so [get-value] dynamically resolves the path to locate [.sql].
 * 3. This slot is often used to extract values from nodes for further processing, assignment, or output within a Hyperlambda execution tree.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the generated SQL statement from a node named [.sql] after a slot like [sql.read], for logging or debugging purposes.
 * - Passing the raw SQL string value stored in [.sql] to another slot for execution or validation.
 * - Displaying the SQL command to an end user or administrator for review before running it against a database.
