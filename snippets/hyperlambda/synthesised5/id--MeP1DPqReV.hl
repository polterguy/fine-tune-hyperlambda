/*
 * 1. [math.decrement] is used to decrease the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.NODE_EXPRESSION_HERE` by a specified step.
 * 2. The optional child node with the value [. :int:2] sets the decrement step to 2, so the value will be reduced by 2 instead of the default 1.
 * 3. This operation is performed in place, directly mutating the value of the target node, rather than producing a new result node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Decreasing a user's score or points by 2 after a specific action (e.g. penalty system).
 * - Managing inventory counts, where each processed transaction reduces the item quantity by 2.
 * - Adjusting countdown timers that need to decrement in steps greater than 1.
 * - Implementing stepwise iterations in custom loops where the counter must decrease by 2 each time.
