/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates multiple string values or expressions into a single string result. In this context, it is being used with the `:x:@.sql` expression as its value, which means the resulting concatenated string will be assigned to the value of the [.sql] node.
 * 2. [get-value:x:@.sql] retrieves the current value of the [.sql] node and includes it as the first part of the concatenated string, effectively appending additional SQL fragments to the existing SQL statement.
 * 3. The literal strings `:) * 1.0 / length(` and `:) as keyword_density, (` are inserted as-is, forming parts of a SQL calculation for keyword density.
 * 4. [get-value:x:@.fields] retrieves the value of the [.fields] node, which is expected to represent a column or expression used in the SQL calculation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically build complex SQL fragments by appending calculated fields, such as keyword density, to an existing SQL query.
 * - Concatenate multiple values and expressions to generate a custom SQL SELECT statement for reporting or analytics.
 * - Assemble calculated SQL columns by combining node values and static text for advanced data processing or visualization.
