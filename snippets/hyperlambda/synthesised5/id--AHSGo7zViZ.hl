/*
 * 1. The [if] slot is used to evaluate a logical condition, and if the condition is true, it executes the code in its [.lambda] child.
 * 2. The [and] slot combines two conditions: [lt] checks if the value of [.numA] is less than 7, and [mt] checks if the value of [.numB] is more than 11. Both must be true for [and] to succeed.
 * 3. The [lt] slot compares [.numA] to 7, returning true if [.numA] is less than 7.
 * 4. The [mt] slot compares [.numB] to 11, returning true if [.numB] is greater than 11.
 * 5. If both conditions are true, [set-value] assigns "true" (as a boolean) to [.output]; otherwise, the [else] block assigns "false" (as a boolean) to [.output].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating if two numerical input values fall within specific ranges before proceeding with further logic.
 * - Setting a flag ([.output]) to indicate whether a set of combined conditions is met.
 * - Simple decision-making for business rules, such as granting access if certain numeric thresholds are satisfied.
 * - Creating branching logic based on multiple numeric comparisons in a workflow.
