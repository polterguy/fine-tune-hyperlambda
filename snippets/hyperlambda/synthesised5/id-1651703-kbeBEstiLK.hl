/*
 * 1. The [lambda2hyper] node appears to be a container or process node, possibly representing a transformation or mapping operation.
 * 2. The [key] node uses the `:x:@io.file.load` expression, which means it retrieves the value from a sibling or ancestor node named [io.file.load] and assigns it as the value of [key]. This is likely extracting the contents of a file previously loaded into [io.file.load].
 * 3. The [fingerprint] node uses the `:x:@crypto.fingerprint` expression, which retrieves the value from a sibling or ancestor node named [crypto.fingerprint] and assigns it as the value of [fingerprint]. This is likely extracting a previously computed cryptographic fingerprint.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Mapping the contents of a loaded file and its cryptographic fingerprint into a new structure for further processing or storage.
 * - Preparing a response or data object that includes both the raw file content and its fingerprint for validation or integrity checking.
 * - Aggregating results from file loading and hashing operations to be used in an API response or logging mechanism.
