/*
 * 1. The [auth.ticket.create] slot is invoked to generate a new JWT token for a user.
 * 2. A [username] child node is provided with the value "thomas", specifying the identity for whom the token should be created.
 * 3. A [roles] node is added with a single child node whose value is "root", granting the user the "root" role in the generated token.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating a JWT token for a system administrator with elevated privileges for API access.
 * - Provisioning a new token for a user who needs access to endpoints restricted to the "root" role.
 * - Testing secure endpoints by generating a token that simulates a superuser.
 * - Automating token generation for deployment scripts or backend integrations that require root-level permissions.
