/*
 * 1. The [io.folder.copy] slot is used to copy the contents of the folder specified in its value, which in this case is [/misc/source-folder/], to the destination path provided as a child node, here [.], with the value [/misc/destination-folder/].
 * 2. Only the contents inside [.source-folder] are copied, not the folder itself; all files and subfolders within [.source-folder] will be duplicated into [.destination-folder].
 * 3. If [.destination-folder] does not exist, an error will occur; it should be created beforehand.
 * 4. The operation does not remove or change the original [.source-folder]; it simply replicates its contents at the new location.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Creating a backup of a working directory by duplicating its files and subfolders into a backup folder.
 * - Preparing a template directory structure for a new user or project by copying from a standard source.
 * - Migrating the contents of one folder to another location as part of a deployment or setup process.
 * - Synchronizing files between two directories within the application's file storage area.
