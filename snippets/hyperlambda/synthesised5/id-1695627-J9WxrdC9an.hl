/*
 * 1. The [return] slot here is used to immediately return from a dynamic slot or endpoint, halting further execution of subsequent nodes.
 * 2. The [result] node is included as a child of [return], and its value is set to "error". This means the return value will be a node named [result] with the string value "error".
 * 3. Since [return] does not evaluate its children as expressions, it simply outputs the [result] node as-is.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To signal an error state from a custom dynamic slot by returning a specific result structure.
 * - To standardize error responses in an API by always returning a [result] node containing an error message.
 * - To abort further processing in a workflow when a critical condition fails, and return an error status to the caller.
