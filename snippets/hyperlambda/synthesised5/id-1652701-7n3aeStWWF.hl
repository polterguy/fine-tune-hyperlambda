/*
 * 1. The [and] slot is used to perform a logical AND operation, requiring all its child conditions to evaluate to true for the overall result to be true.
 * 2. The [ProfessorId.eq] node applies the equality comparison operator to the [ProfessorId] field, checking if its value is equal to the value obtained from the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/ProfessorId`.
 * 3. The expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/ProfessorId` navigates to the [ProfessorId] node that is a child of the node referenced by [.dp], which is typically provided by a [for-each] loop or similar iteration construct.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Filtering or validating that the [ProfessorId] of the current node matches a specific reference value during iteration.
 * - Constructing a SQL WHERE clause to select records where [ProfessorId] equals a given value.
 * - Ensuring data consistency by comparing [ProfessorId] fields across different nodes in a data processing workflow.
