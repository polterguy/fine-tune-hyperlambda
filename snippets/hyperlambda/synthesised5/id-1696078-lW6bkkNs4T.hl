/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the node specified by the expression in its value, in this case `@.sql`. This means it will find the first node named [.sql] in its current scope and return its value.
 * 2. The expression `x:@.sql` is used to locate the [.sql] node relative to the position of the [get-value] invocation.
 * 3. The result of [get-value] will be the string, number, or other value stored in the [.sql] node, which can then be used by subsequent slots or logic.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the actual SQL statement from a [.sql] node for logging or debugging before executing it.
 * - Passing the value of [.sql] as an argument or parameter to another slot or function.
 * - Dynamically determining which SQL command to run by retrieving its value from the appropriate node in a workflow.
 * - Validating the content of a [.sql] node before performing database operations.
