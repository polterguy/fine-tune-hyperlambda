/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it looks for a node named [.fields] in the current context and returns its value.
 * 2. The expression `@.fields` specifically searches for the first [.fields] node available in the ancestor or current node hierarchy.
 * 3. This slot does not modify the node, but simply extracts and returns its value for further processing or output.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting a user-submitted form field collection stored in the [.fields] node to use its data in subsequent logic.
 * - Fetching configuration values or parameters from a predefined [.fields] node in a workflow.
 * - Passing the value of [.fields] to another function or slot that requires this information as input.
