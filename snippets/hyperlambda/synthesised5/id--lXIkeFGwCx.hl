/*
 * 1. The [tasks.delete] slot is used to remove a scheduled or persisted task from the system.
 * 2. By providing the task ID as the value of [tasks.delete], it deletes the task with that identifier.
 * 3. All future schedules and timers associated with the deleted task are also automatically removed, ensuring that the task will no longer be executed or rescheduled.
 * 4. The slot does not accept any additional arguments besides the task ID.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cancel a background process that is no longer needed, such as a report generator.
 * - Remove a scheduled notification or reminder that was set up in error.
 * - Clean up obsolete or completed maintenance jobs from the system.
