/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it looks for the first node named [.fields] in the current context and returns its value.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.fields` uses the "@" iterator to find the [.fields] node relative to the current position in the lambda graph.
 * 3. The result is the raw value stored in the [.fields] node, which could be any data type supported by Hyperlambda (string, int, etc.), depending on how the node was previously set.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting user input or form field values from a [.fields] node for further processing.
 * - Retrieving configuration settings stored under [.fields] to dynamically control workflow behavior.
 * - Accessing data from a previously populated [.fields] node to perform validation or computation.
