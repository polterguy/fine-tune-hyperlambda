/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the node specified by its expression argument. In this case, the expression `:x:@.sql` points to the first node named [.sql] in the current context, and [get-value] returns the value of that node.
 * 2. The `:x:@.sql` expression uses the `@` iterator to search for the first ancestor or sibling node named [.sql], making it flexible for referencing nodes at the same or higher levels in the hierarchy.
 * 3. This slot is especially useful when you need to extract and reuse a specific value stored in a [.sql] node elsewhere in your logic without having to duplicate data or hardcode values.
 * 
 * Possible use cases:
 * - Extracting a dynamically generated SQL statement from a [.sql] node and passing it to another slot for execution or logging.
 * - Accessing configuration or query templates defined in a [.sql] node and applying them in different parts of your workflow.
 * - Fetching the result of a previous computation or external call stored in a [.sql] node for further processing or validation.
