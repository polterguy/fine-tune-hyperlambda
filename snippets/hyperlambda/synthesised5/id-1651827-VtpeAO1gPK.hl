 * 1. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple conditions, and will only evaluate to true if all its child conditions are true.
 * 2. The [not] slot negates the boolean result of its single child, effectively inverting the outcome of the condition it wraps.
 * 3. The [strings.starts-with] slot checks if the value of the [.url] node inside [.arguments] starts with the specified string, either "http://" or "https://".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To validate that a given URL does not start with "http://" or "https://", for example, to enforce the use of relative URLs or to reject absolute URLs.
 * - As part of input validation in an HTTP endpoint, ensuring that a user-provided URL argument is not an absolute URL.
 * - To implement security checks that prevent users from submitting external links.
