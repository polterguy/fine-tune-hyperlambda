/*
 * 1. The [if] slot is used with an expression `:x:@.flag` to check if the [.flag] node evaluates to true. If this condition is true, the content of the [if] slot is executed.
 * 2. The [set-value] slot is invoked within the [if] block to set the value of [.result] to "Yes" when the condition is met.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Conditionally set [.result] to "Yes" if a feature flag [.flag] is enabled.
 * - Use in authentication flows to mark [.result] as "Yes" only if a user is authorized.
 * - Determine system readiness by updating [.result] when a readiness flag is true.
 * - Dynamically control workflow steps by toggling the [.flag] node.
