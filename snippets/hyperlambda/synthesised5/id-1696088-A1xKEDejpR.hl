/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node located by the expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it finds the first node named [.fields] and returns its value.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.fields` uses the `@` iterator to look up the first [.fields] node upwards in the current execution context, regardless of its position relative to the current slot.
 * 3. No child arguments are provided to [get-value], so it performs a direct value extraction from the referenced node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the value of a configuration node named [.fields] to use elsewhere in the logic.
 * - Extracting user input or form field definitions from a dynamically generated structure.
 * - Accessing query parameters or settings stored under a [.fields] node for further processing.
 * - Retrieving a computed or default value from a shared context higher in the node graph.
