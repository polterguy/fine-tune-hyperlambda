/*
 * 1. The [odbc.connect] slot establishes a connection to the ODBC data source named "salesdb" using the alias "sales".
 * 2. The [odbc.select] slot executes an SQL query to retrieve all columns from the "orders" table, ordering the results by the "created_at" column in descending order and limiting the result set to the 5 most recent records.
 * 3. The [yield] slot outputs the results of the [odbc.select] operation, wrapping the selected order records as children of a node named [recent-orders].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve and display the five most recently created orders in a sales dashboard.
 * - Provide an API endpoint for a mobile app to fetch the latest order history.
 * - Generate a quick summary report of recent sales activity for administrative review.
 * - Support a notification system that highlights the newest orders as they are entered into the database.
