/*
 * 1. The [cache.clear] slot is invoked with the value "foo.bar", meaning it will remove all cache entries whose keys start with "foo.bar". 
 * 2. Only cache items within the "foo.bar" namespace, such as [foo.bar], [foo.bar.xyz1], and [foo.bar.xyz2], will be cleared, while other keys are unaffected.
 * 3. This allows for targeted cache invalidation without flushing the entire cache, supporting cache namespacing and more granular control.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Resetting configuration or session data for a specific module by clearing only its cache entries.
 * - Removing cached responses for a group of related API endpoints using a shared key prefix.
 * - Cleaning up user-specific cache items when a user logs out, by namespacing the cache with user identifiers.
 * - Freeing memory for a specific feature or component after a major update, while keeping unrelated cached data intact.
