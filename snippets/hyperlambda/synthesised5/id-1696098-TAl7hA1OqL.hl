/*
 * 1. The [add] slot receives a node set from the [strings.split] operation and adds the resulting nodes to the [.words] node.
 * 2. The [strings.split] slot splits the value of the [.query] node found under [.arguments] into separate strings at each space character, producing a node for each word in the original string.
 * 3. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/query` points to the [.query] node inside [.arguments], extracting its value for splitting.
 * 4. The argument node [.: ] (with a space character) specifies that the string should be split wherever a space occurs.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To break a search query into individual words and add them to a [.words] collection for further processing.
 * - To parse user input into tokens for implementing features like search, tagging, or filtering.
 * - To preprocess a sentence into separate terms before performing text analysis or keyword extraction.
