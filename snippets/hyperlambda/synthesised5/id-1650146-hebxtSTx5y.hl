/*
 * 1. The [time] slot creates a time span object based on its child arguments.
 * 2. The [days] node specifies the number of days for the time span, in this case 365 days.
 * 3. The result is a time span object representing 365 days, which can be used for date and time calculations, such as adding or subtracting from a date.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Adding 365 days to the current date to calculate a date one year in the future.
 * - Subtracting 365 days from a date to find the same day in the previous year.
 * - Scheduling a task to repeat every 365 days (once per year).
