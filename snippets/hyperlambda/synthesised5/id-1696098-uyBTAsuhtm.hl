/*
 * 1. The [set-name] slot is used to change the names of all nodes that are referenced by the expression `:+/+/*/*`. It assigns the result of its child slot as the new name for each of those nodes.
 * 2. The [strings.concat] slot combines the value of the current [.p] node (referenced by .:@p) and the value of the [.no] node (referenced by get-value:x:@.no) into a single string, which becomes the new name for each targeted node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically rename multiple nodes in a subtree by combining values from two sources, such as a prefix and a number.
 * - Create sequentially labeled nodes or uniquely named nodes by appending a number to a base string.
 * - Refactor or restructure node names in a data set for normalization or organizational purposes.
 * - Prepare a data structure for export where node names must follow a specific pattern.
