/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates the values of all its child nodes into a single string, preserving the order of the nodes.
 * 2. The first child node provides the starting string "coalesce(".
 * 3. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the [@.dp/#] expression, meaning it extracts the value from the node currently passed in as reference via [.dp].
 * 4. The final node adds the string ", '')" to complete the concatenation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically constructing SQL expressions such as a COALESCE function call using node values.
 * - Generating template strings where a portion of the content comes from variable data.
 * - Wrapping a referenced value in a function call syntax for code generation.
 * - Creating log messages or output statements that embed values from referenced nodes.
