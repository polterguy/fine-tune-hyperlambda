/*
 * 1. The [add] slot here is used to attach new nodes to a specific location in the node graph, precisely at the path defined by the expression `:x:@for-each/@for-each/@.dp/#/*/tables/0/-`. This path navigates through two parent [for-each] loops, accesses the current [.dp] node by reference, traverses its children named [tables], selects the first child ([0]), and then moves to its previous sibling with the [-] iterator.
 * 2. The child node of [add] is an unnamed node (.), which acts as a container or parent for the [foreign_keys] node, making it possible to group the [foreign_keys] node under a specific structure in the resulting graph.
 * 3. The [foreign_keys] node is added as a child of the unnamed node, effectively appending or injecting foreign key information into the location identified by the expression above. This enables the enrichment or augmentation of the data structure with additional relational metadata at the precise location required.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically augmenting table metadata with foreign key information during a schema traversal or documentation generation process.
 * - Constructing an enriched data model for use in code generation, where foreign key relationships need to be embedded within table definitions.
 * - Building an export or migration script that requires foreign key data to be associated within the correct context of each table in a larger metadata structure.
 * - Merging analysis results from multiple iterations to a specific node in a data structure, ensuring relational information is not lost during processing.
