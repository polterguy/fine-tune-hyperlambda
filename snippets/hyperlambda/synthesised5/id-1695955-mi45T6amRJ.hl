/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot is used here to retrieve the value from a node whose name is [sql]. The expression `:x:@.sql` points to the first node named [sql] within the current scope, and [get-value] returns its value.
 * 2. This operation is useful for extracting the scalar value stored in the [sql] node, which may contain information such as a generated SQL statement or a configuration detail.
 * 3. The result can then be used in subsequent processing, logging, or as a parameter to other slots.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Fetching the actual SQL query string produced earlier in the pipeline for display or debugging purposes.
 * - Passing the SQL statement from [sql] as input to another slot that requires the statement as a value.
 * - Validating or transforming the [sql] value before executing it against a database.
