/*
 * 1. [pgsql.connect] establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database using the connection string or alias specified by [accounts].
 * 2. [pgsql.create] inserts a new record into the [users] table; the inserted record includes [name] with value "Alice Smith" and [email] with value "alice@example.com".
 * 3. [yield] returns a message to the caller confirming that the user was inserted successfully by outputting a [message] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Registering a new user in a web application by inserting their details into the [users] table.
 * - Automating onboarding workflows where user records need to be quickly added to the database.
 * - Integrating external systems that push new user information into the platform.
 * - Providing feedback to an API client that a database operation has completed successfully.
