/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate a sequence of strings and values into a single string value, using the results of expressions and static fragments.
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of nodes named [.sql], [.fields], and [.no], which are likely prepared earlier in the execution tree.
 * 3. Multiple static string fragments are inserted to build a complex SQL expression, including function calls like length(), replace(), and lower() as pieces of the output.
 * 4. The expression is constructed step by step, combining static SQL fragments and dynamic values, likely to create a SQL snippet that calculates the number of occurrences of a substring in a string.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Generating a dynamic SQL query for counting how many times a parameterized value appears in a field.
 * - Building advanced search or analytics queries in Hyperlambda, where SQL expressions must be constructed at runtime.
 * - Creating database-agnostic logic for string counting in reporting or business intelligence features.
 * - Dynamically assembling SQL fragments before sending them to a database for execution, based on input or previously calculated values.
