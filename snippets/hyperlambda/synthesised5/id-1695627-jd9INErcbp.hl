/*
 * 1. The [not] slot inverts the boolean result of its child slot, effectively turning true to false and vice versa.
 * 2. The [strings.starts-with] slot checks whether the value of the node found by the expression `:x:@csv2lambda/0/0` begins with the string "https://".
 * 3. The expression `:x:@csv2lambda/0/0` retrieves the first value of the first child node under the [csv2lambda] node, typically representing a string value extracted from a CSV-to-lambda conversion.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating that a URL in the first field of the first CSV row does not start with "https://".
 * - Preventing processing of records where the value is already a secure URL.
 * - Ensuring imported CSV data does not contain links with a secure protocol in a specific position.
 * - Filtering out records that do not meet a required prefix condition before further processing.
