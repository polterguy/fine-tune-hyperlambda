/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node defines two input parameters: [limit] and [offset], both expected to be integers. These are used for paging the results of a database query.
 * 2. The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks if the current user has one of the roles: root, admin, or user, enforcing authorization before proceeding.
 * 3. The [data.connect] slot establishes a connection to the "crm" database, preparing for subsequent data operations.
 * 4. Inside [data.connect], the [data.read] slot queries the [contacts] table, using the values from [.arguments] for [limit] and [offset] to control paging.
 * 5. The [return-nodes] slot returns all child nodes of [data.read] as the output, effectively sending the retrieved contacts as the response.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching a specific page of contact records in a CRM application, with support for customizing the number of results and the starting point.
 * - Ensuring only authenticated users with appropriate roles can access contact data.
 * - Providing a paged API endpoint for a frontend to display contacts with "next" and "previous" navigation.
