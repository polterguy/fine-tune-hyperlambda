/*
 * 1. The [lambda2csv] slot converts the children nodes of [data.read] into a CSV string. It takes all direct children of [data.read] and serializes their contents into a CSV format, including headers based on the node names and preserving type information as additional output nodes.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@data.read/*` selects all immediate children of [data.read] to be included in the CSV conversion.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Exporting a collection of records stored as child nodes under [data.read] into a CSV file for data sharing or backup.
 * - Converting structured lambda data into a format that can be imported into spreadsheet applications or other systems that accept CSV.
 * - Preparing data for round-trip serialization, where the CSV can later be converted back to lambda objects with type fidelity using [csv2lambda].
