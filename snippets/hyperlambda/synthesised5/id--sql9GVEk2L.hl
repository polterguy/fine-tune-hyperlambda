/*
 * 1. The [cache.set] slot is used here to store a cache item using the key [session.message]. Since no [value] child node is provided, this invocation will remove any existing cache item associated with the [session.message] key.
 * 2. If a [value] node was present, the slot would save its value under the [session.message] key in the cache, but in this case, it acts as a cache removal operation.
 * 3. This operation does not specify an [expiration] node, so if a value were provided, it would default to expiring in 5 seconds. However, since no value is set, the expiration argument is not relevant here.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Remove a session-specific message from the cache when the user logs out.
 * - Clear a temporary notification or alert for a user session after it is no longer needed.
 * - Ensure that sensitive session data is deleted from the cache when it should not persist.
