/*
 * 1. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple logical conditions, and will only return true if all of its child conditions are true.
 * 2. The [ProfessorId.eq] node applies the equality comparison operator to the [ProfessorId] field, checking if its value is equal to the value obtained from the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/ProfessorId`.
 * 3. The expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/ProfessorId` navigates to the [ProfessorId] node within the children of the node referenced by [.dp], which is typically the current item in a [for-each] loop.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Filtering records where the [ProfessorId] field matches a specific value from another node during iteration.
 * - Constructing a SQL WHERE clause to select rows with a [ProfessorId] equal to a given value.
 * - Validating that a [ProfessorId] in one context matches the [ProfessorId] in another, such as during data synchronization or integrity checks.
