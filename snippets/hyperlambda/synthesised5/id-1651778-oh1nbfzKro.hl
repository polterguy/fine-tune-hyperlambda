/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot checks if the argument referenced by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/question_id` exists and is not null. If the [question_id] node is missing or its value is null, an exception is thrown, stopping further execution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that an API endpoint always receives a [question_id] parameter before processing a request.
 * - Validating form input to guarantee that a required field, such as [question_id], is provided by the user.
 * - Enforcing business logic where operations cannot proceed without a valid [question_id].
