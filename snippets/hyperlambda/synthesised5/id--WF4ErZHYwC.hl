/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node defines a required input argument named [password] of type string, specifying that the endpoint expects a password parameter from the caller.
 * 2. The [validators.mandatory] slot ensures that the [password] argument is present; if it's missing, execution stops with an error.
 * 3. The [validators.string] slot validates the [password] value, enforcing a minimum length of 12 characters for basic password strength requirements.
 * 4. The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks if the current authentication ticket is valid, confirming the user's session or credentials before proceeding.
 * 5. The [unwrap] slot evaluates the next sibling node's expressions, ensuring any lazy-evaluated results are fully processed in sequence.
 * 6. The [signal:magic.auth.change-password] slot emits a system signal to trigger the password change functionality, passing the new password value from the input arguments.
 * 7. The [return-nodes] slot returns a [result] node with the value "success" to indicate the operation completed successfully.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Enforcing strong password policies when users attempt to change their password via an authenticated API endpoint.
 * - Implementing secure password update mechanisms that require session validation and input checking.
 * - Integrating with a system that uses signals to trigger asynchronous password change events or workflows.
 * - Providing clear success feedback to the client when a password change completes.
