/*
 * 1. The [if] slot is used to check a condition and only execute its [.lambda] child if the condition is true.
 * 2. [get-value] retrieves the value of the [flag] node inside [.args] using the expression `:x:@.args/*/flag`.
 * 3. [set-value] updates the value of the [.result] node to "Yes", but only if the condition is satisfied.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Displaying a confirmation message if a user-selected flag is true.
 * - Proceeding with a workflow step only if a prerequisite condition held in [.args] is enabled.
 * - Setting a result or status node in an API response if an input flag is checked.
