/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot is used to delete nodes from the node graph.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@signal/*/*/db/=master` identifies all [db] nodes (under any child and grandchild of [signal]) that have a value exactly equal to "master".
 * 3. All nodes matching this expression are removed from the graph, including their children if any.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up database configuration nodes for "master" environments from a signal graph.
 * - Removing sensitive or deprecated [db] nodes before further processing or exporting data.
 * - Dynamically pruning nodes based on value, such as disabling or isolating specific connections in workflow execution.
