/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it will access the value of the [fields] node that exists in the current node graph.
 * 2. The expression `@.fields` specifically targets the first [fields] node found in the current context, and [get-value] extracts and returns its value.
 * 3. This approach is useful for dynamically fetching data from a node within the execution context without knowing the value ahead of time.
 * 
 * Typical use cases:
 * - Extracting user input or submitted form data stored in a [fields] node.
 * - Reading configuration or metadata values from a [fields] node for further processing.
 * - Passing the value of [fields] as an argument to another slot or function, such as for validation or transformation.
