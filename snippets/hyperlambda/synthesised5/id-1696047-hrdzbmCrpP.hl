/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to append nodes to a target location, specified here by the expression `:x:./*/data.read`, which points to all [data.read] children of the parent node.
 * 2. [get-nodes] is invoked twice, each time referencing a different node under [.arguments]: first [order], then [direction]. Both invocations retrieve all child nodes named [order] and [direction] from within [.arguments], returning these as collections of nodes.
 * 3. The result is that all nodes under [.arguments] with the names [order] and [direction] are added as children to every [data.read] node found at the appropriate position in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically inject [order] and [direction] parameters into every [data.read] operation in a workflow.
 * - Propagate sorting and ordering preferences from user input ([.arguments]) to underlying data retrieval logic.
 * - Dynamically extend the configuration of multiple [data.read] nodes by merging additional context or settings from incoming arguments.
