/*
 * 1. [mssql.connect] establishes a connection to the [crm] Microsoft SQL Server database, making all child operations execute within this connection context.
 * 2. [mssql.delete] prepares an SQL DELETE statement for the [users] table, targeting only records matching the condition(s) specified under [where].
 * 3. The [where] node contains an [and] logical operator, specifying that only records in [users] where [id] equals 101 will be deleted.
 * 4. [yield] returns a response object containing a [message] node with the value "success" to indicate the operation completed as intended.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Deleting a user from the [users] table by their unique [id] after account closure.
 * - Removing test accounts or data by specifying their [id] for database cleanup.
 * - Providing API endpoints for administrators to remove specific users and returning a success message upon completion.
 * - Ensuring that database operations are wrapped in clear connection and response patterns for reliability and traceability.
