/*
 * 1. The [data.update] slot is used to update records in a database table, in this case the [tasks] table.
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies the type of database being used, here set to "sqlite".
 * 3. The [table] node indicates the target table for the update operation, which is [tasks].
 * 4. The [values] node is where you define the columns and their new values to be updated for matching records.
 * 5. The [where] node, containing an [and] node, is used to specify conditions that must be met for records to be updated. Multiple conditions can be added as children of [and] to create compound filters.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Updating the status or due date of specific tasks in the [tasks] table that match certain criteria.
 * - Modifying multiple fields of tasks that meet a set of conditions, such as tasks assigned to a particular user and not yet completed.
 * - Bulk updating records in the [tasks] table based on complex filters, such as all tasks created before a certain date and with a specific priority.
