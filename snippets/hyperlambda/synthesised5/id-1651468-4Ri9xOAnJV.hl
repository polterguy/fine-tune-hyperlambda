/*
 * 1. The [http.post] slot sends an HTTP POST request to the specified URL, in this case "https://httpbin.org/post".
 * 2. The [convert] node with value true instructs the slot to automatically convert the response object to the appropriate type based on the response content.
 * 3. The [query] node provides query string parameters to be appended to the URL, with [some_query_param] set to "foo bar" and [another_query_param] set to the value referenced by the expression `:x:@.query2`.
 * 4. The [payload] node defines the body of the POST request, with [category] set to the value referenced by the expression `:x:@.category` and [sort] set to "price_asc".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Submitting a search or filter request to a REST API with both query string parameters and a JSON body.
 * - Sending data to an endpoint that requires dynamic values for some fields, using expressions to reference other nodes.
 * - Automatically parsing and converting the response from an external API for further processing in the workflow.
