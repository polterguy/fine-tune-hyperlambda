/*
 * 1. [log.info] is used to log a message. In this case, it logs "Creating synthetic snippet" along with additional data.
 * 2. The [expression] node is used to provide extra detail to the log entry. Its value is the result of the expression `:x:@.tmp`, meaning it injects the current value or reference found at the [.tmp] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Debugging: Track when a synthetic snippet is being created and log the current state or value of [.tmp].
 * - Auditing: Maintain a log of all synthetic snippet creations with contextual data for future review.
 * - Workflow Automation: Monitor and verify the execution flow by logging key operations and their associated data.
 * - Troubleshooting: Quickly identify issues by correlating log entries with the value held in [.tmp] at the time of snippet creation.
