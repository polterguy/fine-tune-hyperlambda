/*
 * 1. The [validators.enum] slot validates that the values of all [aggregate_column] nodes under [.arguments] match one of the allowed options.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/aggregate_column` targets every [aggregate_column] node, potentially across multiple argument sets.
 * 3. The allowed values for [aggregate_column] are explicitly set to "Regions.RegionID" and "Regions.RegionDescription" as child nodes of [validators.enum].
 * 4. If any [aggregate_column] value does not match one of these two options, an exception is thrown to halt execution and report the invalid value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Enforcing that only permitted column names are used for aggregation in a reporting API.
 * - Validating user input in an endpoint that generates SQL groupings, ensuring only supported columns are referenced.
 * - Preventing accidental or malicious selection of unauthorized columns in a dynamic query builder.
 * - Guaranteeing that downstream processing logic receives only expected column values, avoiding runtime errors.
