/*
 * 1. The [mssql.connect] slot establishes a connection to the SQL Server database named "projects".
 * 2. The [mssql.delete] slot is used to delete records from the [projects] table.
 * 3. The [where] clause, with its [and] condition, specifies that only records where the [status] field is equal to "archived" will be deleted.
 * 4. The [yield] slot returns a [message] node with the value "OK" to indicate successful completion of the operation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Removing all archived projects from the [projects] table in a project management application.
 * - Automating clean-up routines that periodically delete old or archived items from a database.
 * - Providing an administrative endpoint for bulk removal of records meeting certain criteria (e.g., status = archived).
 * - Confirming to the client or user that the deletion action has completed successfully with a simple success message.
