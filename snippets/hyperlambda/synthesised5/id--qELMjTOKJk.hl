/*
 * 1. The [.data] node is created with three children: [item1], [item2], and [item3], each having different values.
 * 2. The [get-name] slot is invoked with an expression that selects all children of [.data] whose value is "thomas" (`:x:@.data/*/={thomas}`).
 * 3. [get-name] will return the name of the node that matches this criteria, which is [item2] because its value is "thomas".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Find the property name (node name) associated with a specific value in a configuration or lookup list.
 * - Dynamically resolve which user or entity matches a particular identifier in a dataset.
 * - Retrieve the key from a key-value list when you only know the value.
