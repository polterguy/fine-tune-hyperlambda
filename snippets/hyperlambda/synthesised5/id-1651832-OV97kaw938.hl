/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks a condition and executes its [.lambda] child only if the condition is true.
 * 2. The [not] slot inverts the result of its child condition, which is [strings.starts-with].
 * 3. The [strings.starts-with] slot checks if the value of [.url] inside [.arguments] starts with "http".
 * 4. If the condition is true (i.e., [.url] does not start with "http"), the [.lambda] block is executed.
 * 5. Inside [.lambda], [set-value] updates the value of [.url] inside [.arguments].
 * 6. The new value is created by [strings.concat], which prepends "https://" to the original value of [.url].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that a user-provided URL always starts with "https://" before making an HTTP request.
 * - Normalizing URLs in API endpoints to guarantee a valid protocol prefix.
 * - Automatically correcting incomplete URLs submitted through a web form.
