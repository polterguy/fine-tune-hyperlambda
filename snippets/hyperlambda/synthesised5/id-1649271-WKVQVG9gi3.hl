/*
 * 1. The [data.create] slot is used to insert a new record into a database table. It is a polymorphic abstraction that can target different database types.
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies the type of database to use for the operation. In this case, it is set to "sqlite", meaning the operation will be executed against a SQLite database.
 * 3. The [table] node defines the target table for the insert operation. Here, the table is [address].
 * 4. The [values] node is intended to contain child nodes representing the column names and their corresponding values to be inserted into the [address] table. In this example, the [values] node is empty, so no actual data will be inserted unless child nodes are added.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Inserting a new address record into a SQLite database by specifying column-value pairs under the [values] node.
 * - Creating a generic data insertion routine that can target different database types by changing the [database-type] value.
 * - Dynamically building insert operations for various tables by modifying the [table] and [values] nodes at runtime.
