/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to broadcast a SignalR event named "northwind.Employees.delete" to connected clients or subscribers.
 * 2. The [args] node is included as a child, which is where you would typically place any arguments or data to be sent with the signal, but in this case, it is empty, so no additional data is transmitted with the event.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Notify all connected clients in real time that an employee record has been deleted from the Northwind database.
 * - Trigger UI updates or refreshes on client applications when an employee is deleted.
 * - Integrate with other systems or microservices that need to react to employee deletions by listening for this specific event.
