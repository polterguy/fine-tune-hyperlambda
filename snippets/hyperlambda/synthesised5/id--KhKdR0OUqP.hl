/*
 * 1. The [.data] node contains several child nodes, each with a name and value, such as [foo1], [foo2], and [foo3].
 * 2. The [get-value] slot is used with the expression `:x:@.data/1`, which targets the second child of the [.data] node (using zero-based indexing).
 * 3. The result of [get-value] will be the value of the [foo2] node, which is "bar2".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving the value of a specific item in a list of nodes based on its position.
 * - Accessing configuration or data entries where order matters, such as processing the second element in a sequence.
 * - Implementing logic that depends on the value of a particular sibling node within a data structure.
