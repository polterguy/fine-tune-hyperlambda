/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node identified by the expression `:x:@.sql`. This means it looks for the first node named [.sql] in the current context and returns its value.
 * 2. The `x:@.sql` expression uses the `@` iterator to locate the nearest ancestor or sibling node named [.sql].
 * 3. This operation is useful for extracting the raw value stored in [.sql], which could be a SQL query string, a status message, or any other data assigned to that node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching a dynamically generated SQL query from the [.sql] node for display, debugging, or further processing.
 * - Passing the value of [.sql] as a parameter to another slot that requires the constructed SQL statement.
 * - Validating or logging the generated SQL command before executing it against a database.
