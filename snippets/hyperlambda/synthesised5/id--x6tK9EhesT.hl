/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression in its value argument.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.data` points to the [.data] node, so [get-value] will extract its value.
 * 3. In this example, the [.data] node has the value "value", so [get-value] will return "value".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the value of a configuration node such as [.config] to use elsewhere in your logic.
 * - Reading a user's input stored in a specific node for validation or further processing.
 * - Passing the value from a data node to another slot as an argument.
 * - Logging the current state of a node's value for debugging or audit purposes.
