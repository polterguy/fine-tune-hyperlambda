/*
 * 1. The [insert-before] slot is used to insert new nodes directly before the node(s) specified by its expression argument. In this case, it takes the result of the expression `:x:@.list/*/item1` to identify the [item1] node under [.list] and then inserts a new node before it.
 * 2. The node to be inserted, named [inserted], is defined as a child of the unnamed node argument to [insert-before]. This structure allows you to specify what node(s) should be inserted and where in the node hierarchy they should appear relative to the referenced destination node(s).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Prepending new items to a list before a specific element, such as inserting headers or markers before the first item.
 * - Dynamically reordering or augmenting a node collection by inserting nodes at precise positions based on runtime conditions.
 * - Updating structured data or configuration trees where new nodes must appear in a particular order relative to existing nodes.
