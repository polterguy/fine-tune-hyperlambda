/*
 * 1. The [io.file.load] slot loads the content of the [foo.txt] file and places its contents as the value of the [io.file.load] node.
 * 2. The [if] slot checks whether the loaded file content contains the substring "Magic Cloud" by using the [strings.contains] slot, which takes the file content as its input.
 * 3. If the condition is true (the file contains "Magic Cloud"), the [.lambda] child logs the message "File contains 'Magic Cloud'" using [log.info].
 * 4. If the condition is false (the file does not contain "Magic Cloud"), the [else] branch logs "File does not contain 'Magic Cloud'".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To check if a configuration or data file contains a specific keyword before proceeding with further logic.
 * - To verify that a file has been generated or updated with expected content as part of an automation process.
 * - For conditional logging or triggering actions based on the presence or absence of certain text in files uploaded by users.
 * - To monitor log files for specific entries and act accordingly.
