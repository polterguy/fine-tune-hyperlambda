/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] node establishes a connection to the [hr_db] database.
 * 2. The [database-type] node under [data.connect] specifies that the database is a Microsoft SQL Server (mssql).
 * 3. The [data.read] node initiates a SQL SELECT operation using the same [database-type] (mssql) and targets the [employees] table.
 * 4. The [columns] node defines the column selection, specifically requesting an aggregate count of all rows (count(*)), and assigns the alias [count] to the result.
 * 5. The [limit] node restricts the result to only 1 record, ensuring at most a single aggregate result row is returned.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Obtaining the total number of employee records in the [employees] table for reporting or dashboard purposes.
 * - Checking if the [employees] table contains any records (if the result is zero, the table is empty).
 * - Integrating with an API endpoint to provide employee statistics without exposing detailed employee data.
 * - Preventing performance issues by setting [limit] to restrict the result size even for aggregate queries.
