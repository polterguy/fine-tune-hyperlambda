/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node targeted by the expression `:x:@.sql`. This means it will look for the first node named [.sql] in the current scope and return its value.
 * 2. The `:x:@.sql` expression uses the `@` iterator to find the first ancestor or sibling node with the name [.sql].
 * 3. By returning only the value from [.sql], any child nodes or structure under [.sql] are ignored.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the SQL statement or string held in [.sql] for further processing, logging, or output.
 * - Using inside a dynamic slot or endpoint to access a user-supplied SQL query.
 * - Returning the value of [.sql] as part of a response to an HTTP request, for debugging or verification.
 * - Passing the SQL query contained in [.sql] to another slot for execution or manipulation.
