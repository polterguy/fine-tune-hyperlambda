/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to add (append) a new node as a child to each node found by the expression `:x:@.fields`.  
 * 2. The child of [add] is a node with no name, but its value is an expression `:x:@strings.concat`, which means it will evaluate the [strings.concat] slot and use its result as the value for the new node being added.  
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically append the result of a string concatenation to all nodes specified by [.fields].
 * - Useful for dynamic form processing where combined string values need to be added to each field node.
 * - Supports batch processing scenarios where results of string manipulation must be attached to multiple nodes at once.
 * - Can be leveraged in data transformation pipelines to enhance or augment field collections with new computed values.
