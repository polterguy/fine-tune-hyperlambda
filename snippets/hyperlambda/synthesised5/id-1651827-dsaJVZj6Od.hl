/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to publish a SignalR event to all connections subscribed to the method specified by the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.arguments/@.arguments/*/channel`. This means the channel name is dynamically determined from the input arguments.
 * 2. The [roles] child node is set to "root", so only users with the "root" role will receive the signal.
 * 3. The [args] node contains two children: [message] with a static value of "ERROR", and [extra], which is dynamically set to the value from the [message] node under [.arguments].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Broadcasting an error notification to all administrators (root role) on a specific channel when a critical issue occurs.
 * - Sending a structured error message to privileged users in real-time, including additional context from the triggering event.
 * - Dynamically routing error alerts to different SignalR channels based on runtime parameters.
