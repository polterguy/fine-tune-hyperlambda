/*
 * 1. The [if] slot is used for conditional branching, checking if certain criteria are met before executing its associated [.lambda] block.
 * 2. The [or] slot combines multiple conditions so that if any of them are true, its child [.lambda] node is executed.
 * 3. The [null] slot checks if the value referenced by the `:x:@cache.get` expression is null, indicating that no cache item was found.
 * 4. The [eq] slot compares the value returned by `:x:@cache.get` to an empty value, handling cases where a cache item exists but is empty.
 * 5. The [throw] slot raises an exception with a custom message and additional properties such as [status] and [public] to signal an error state when cache is missing or expired.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating that required cache data exists before proceeding with business logic in an API endpoint.
 * - Ensuring that if cached items are missing or expired, the system fails gracefully by providing a specific error message and status code.
 * - Protecting against using empty or null cache responses, which might otherwise cause downstream errors in data processing.
 * - Exposing a public error (using [public]) to inform API consumers about cache expiration or availability issues.
