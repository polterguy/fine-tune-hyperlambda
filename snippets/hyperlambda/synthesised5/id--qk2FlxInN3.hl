/*
 * 1. The [http.post] slot sends an HTTP POST request to the specified URL, in this case "https://somewhere.com/api/v1/contacts".
 * 2. The [convert] node set to true instructs the slot to automatically parse and convert the response content into a lambda object, if a converter is available for the returned content type.
 * 3. The [payload] node contains the data to be sent in the body of the POST request, with child nodes [name] (set to "Thomas") and [email] (whose value is resolved dynamically from the [.email] node using the expression `x:@.email`).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating a new contact in a remote CRM system by submitting a name and email address.
 * - Integrating user registration with a third-party service that requires contact details via API.
 * - Automating onboarding workflows where user information must be posted to an external endpoint.
 * - Syncing local contact records to a cloud-based contact management solution.
