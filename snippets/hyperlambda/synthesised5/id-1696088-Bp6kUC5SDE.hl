/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression in its value parameter. In this case, the expression `:x:@.sql` points to the first node named [.sql] in the current context, and [get-value] will extract its value.
 * 2. This approach is useful when you need to dynamically access the value of a specific node, especially when the node may not always be at a fixed position in the structure, or when you want to decouple your logic from hardcoded values.
 * 3. The expression uses the `@` iterator to find the [.sql] node, ensuring that the code remains flexible even if the position of [.sql] changes within the parent node tree.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the generated SQL statement from a prior [sql.*] operation for logging or display purposes.
 * - Passing the SQL query string to another slot for execution or further manipulation.
 * - Verifying or testing the output of a [sql.*] operation by programmatically retrieving and comparing the generated SQL.
