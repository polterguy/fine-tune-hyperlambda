/*
 * 1. The [tasks.create] slot is used to define and persist a new scheduled task with the ID [foo-bar-task-3]. This node includes configuration for both one-time and recurring executions.
 * 2. The [due] nodes specify exact UTC timestamps for single executions of the task: once on January 1, 2025 at 23:59:27 and again on January 1, 2030 at 23:59:27.
 * 3. The [repeats] nodes define two recurring schedules: one to execute the task every 5 seconds, and another every 3 hours.
 * 4. The [.lambda] node contains the logic executed each time the task runs, which in this case writes an informational log entry [Executing foo-bar-task-2].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automate cleanup, reporting, or notification tasks that require both periodic and specific-date triggers.
 * - Schedule reminders or follow-ups for important dates while maintaining frequent status updates.
 * - Coordinate maintenance windows with both regular intervals and fixed, one-off dates.
 * - Combine high-frequency monitoring (e.g., every 5 seconds) with special event handling on particular dates.
