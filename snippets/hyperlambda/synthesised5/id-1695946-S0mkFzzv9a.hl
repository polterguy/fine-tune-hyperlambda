/*
 * 1. The [validators.default] slot examines the child nodes of the node collection returned by the expression `:x:@.arguments`. 
 * 2. If a child node named [limit] does not exist within the [.arguments] collection, it appends a [limit] node with a value of 10 and type long.
 * 3. If a [limit] node exists but its value is null, it sets the value to 10 (long).
 * 4. If [limit] already exists and has a non-null value, it leaves it unchanged.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Establishing a default limit for pagination in an API endpoint if the client does not supply one.
 * - Ensuring a fallback value for [limit] to prevent unbounded queries when consuming external input.
 * - Providing a sensible default for maximum results returned from a database read operation.
 * - Supporting optional arguments in endpoints, where defaults are automatically set if not provided.
