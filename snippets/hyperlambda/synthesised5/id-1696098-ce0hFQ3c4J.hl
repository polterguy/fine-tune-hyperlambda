/*
 * 1. The [exists] slot checks if a node named [offset] exists as a child of the [.arguments] node. It uses the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/offset` to search for this node.
 * 2. The result will be a boolean value: true if the [offset] node is found among the children of [.arguments], and false otherwise.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To determine if the caller has provided an [offset] argument when invoking an HTTP endpoint.
 * - As a precondition before attempting to use or validate the [offset] value within business logic.
 * - To enable conditional branching, such as applying pagination only when an [offset] parameter is present in the request.
