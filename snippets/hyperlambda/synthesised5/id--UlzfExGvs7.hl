/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to broadcast a real-time SignalR event named "foo.bar" to a specific set of users.
 * 2. The [users] child node specifies a comma-separated list of usernames ([user1], [user2], [user3]) who will receive the message.
 * 3. The [args] node contains additional data ([howdy] with value "world") that will be serialized as JSON and passed to the event subscribers.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Notify a selected group of users about a system update or event in real time.
 * - Send a direct message to multiple users in a chat or collaboration application.
 * - Push custom alerts to targeted users, such as administrators or specific roles, without broadcasting to all connected clients.
