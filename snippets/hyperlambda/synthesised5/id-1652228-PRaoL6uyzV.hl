/*
 * 1. The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to at least one of the roles specified in its value, which in this case are "partner" and "professional".
 * 2. If the user does not belong to either the "partner" or "professional" role, the slot will throw an exception, effectively preventing further execution of the code.
 * 3. This slot is typically used at the beginning of an HTTP endpoint to enforce role-based access control, ensuring only authorized users with the required roles can proceed.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Securing an endpoint so only users with the "partner" or "professional" role can access it.
 * - Restricting access to sensitive business functions to specific user groups.
 * - Implementing multi-role authorization checks for API endpoints.
