/*
 * 1. The [data.create] slot is used to insert a new record into a database table.  
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies the type of database to use, in this case [sqlite], ensuring the correct SQL dialect and connection logic is applied.  
 * 3. The [table] node indicates the target table for the insert operation, here [Order Details].  
 * 4. The [values] node is intended to contain child nodes representing column names and their corresponding values for the new record to be inserted.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Adding a new order detail record to an SQLite database in an e-commerce application.
 * - Inserting transactional data into a specific table as part of a larger workflow.
 * - Creating new entries in a reporting or logging table for audit purposes.
