/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to read data from a database table, in this case from the [Artists] table.
 * 2. The [table] argument specifies the table to query, here set to [Artists].
 * 3. The [limit] argument restricts the number of records returned to 50, overriding the default limit of 25.
 * 4. The [columns] node specifies which columns to include in the result set, here [ArtistId] and [StageName].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving the first 50 artists from the [Artists] table, showing only their IDs and stage names.
 * - Displaying a paginated list of artist names and IDs in an admin dashboard.
 * - Exporting a subset of artist data for reporting or integration with another system.
