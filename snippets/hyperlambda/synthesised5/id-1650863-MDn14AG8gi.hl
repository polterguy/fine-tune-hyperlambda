/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node(s) referenced by its expression argument.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.payload/*` points to all child nodes of the [payload] node, returning their values.
 * 3. If [payload] has multiple children, [get-value] will return the values of each child node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting all values from the children of a [payload] node, such as when processing input data in an HTTP endpoint.
 * - Collecting form field values submitted as children of [payload] for further processing or validation.
 * - Aggregating data from multiple input nodes under [payload] before performing operations like saving to a database.
