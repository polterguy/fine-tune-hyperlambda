 * 1. The [else] slot is used to execute the following block only if previous [if] or [else-if] conditions were not met.
 * 2. The [sockets.signal] slot sends a real-time message to all clients subscribed to the channel specified by the value of the [.feedback-channel] node inside [.arguments].
 * 3. The [args] node contains the data payload for the signal, here providing a [message] node with "Done!" and a [type] node set to "success".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Notify a specific group of users in real-time that an operation has completed successfully.
 * - Provide client-side feedback through websockets after a backend process finishes.
 * - Broadcast a "success" message to any clients listening on a dynamically determined feedback channel.
 * - Integrate with front-end logic that listens for feedback events to display user notifications.
