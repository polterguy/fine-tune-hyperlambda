/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to append new child nodes to the node(s) referenced by the expression in its valueâ€”in this case, the [.result] node.
 * 2. The root [add] takes an expression `:x:@.result` to find the destination node(s) where new children should be added.
 * 3. Its child node (a dot node) acts as a container, grouping the nodes to be added. Here, it contains a single [data] node with a value of "info".
 * 4. As a result, the [data] node will be appended as a child to the [.result] node after execution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically attach information or status messages to a result node when building API responses.
 * - Collect results from different computations or processes and aggregate them under a shared parent node.
 * - Incrementally build up a result tree, appending additional nodes as data becomes available.
 * - Add metadata or audit information to output nodes in a workflow.
 * - Merge nodes from different sources into a single result container.
