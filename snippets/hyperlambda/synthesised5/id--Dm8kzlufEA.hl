/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks if its first child evaluates to boolean true (`.:bool:false`), and only executes its [.lambda] if the condition is true.
 * 2. The [.lambda] node under [if] contains a [set-value] slot that updates the value of all [.result] sibling nodes to "failure".
 * 3. The [else] slot provides an alternative action if the [if] condition is false, directly setting the value of all [.result] sibling nodes to "OK" using [set-value].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - As a simple success/failure handler after a conditional check, updating [.result] accordingly.
 * - To implement a fallback logic: if the main condition fails, a default value ("OK") is set.
 * - For branching logic in HTTP endpoints or business workflows where [.result] must reflect the outcome of a test.
 * - For initializing or updating a status node based on whether a specific condition is met or not.
