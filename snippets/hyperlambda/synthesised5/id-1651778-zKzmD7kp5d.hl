/*
 * 1. The [data.delete] slot is used to delete records from a database table. It requires at least the [table] argument to specify which table to delete from.
 * 2. The [database-type] node is set to "sqlite", indicating that the operation should target an SQLite database.
 * 3. The [where] node is used to specify the condition(s) for which records should be deleted. In this case, it uses an [and] node, which means multiple conditions can be combined, but no specific conditions are provided in this snippet.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Deleting specific records from the [questions] table in an SQLite database when additional conditions are added under [and].
 * - Removing all records from the [questions] table if the [where] clause is left empty (not recommended).
 * - Integrating into a workflow where records need to be conditionally deleted based on dynamic criteria.
