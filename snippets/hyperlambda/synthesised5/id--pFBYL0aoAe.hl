/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks a composite condition using [or] and only executes its [.lambda] block if at least one of the conditions is true.
 * 2. The [or] slot evaluates the results of [get-value] for both [.status] and [.timeout], returning true if either node is true.
 * 3. Inside the [.lambda] block, the [set-value] slot updates the value of [.alert] to "Package issue detected".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Triggering an alert if a package's status is false or if a timeout has occurred.
 * - Notifying a user when a shipment encounters any issue, such as delivery failure or delay.
 * - Automatically flagging problematic packages based on multiple monitoring signals.
 * - Sending a warning message in a logistics system when package status or timeout conditions are met.
