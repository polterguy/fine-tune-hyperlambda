/*
 * 1. The [validators.enum] slot is used to ensure that the value of the [.aggregate_column] argument within [.arguments] matches one of the explicitly listed allowed values.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/aggregate_column` points to the [.aggregate_column] node, extracting its value for validation.
 * 3. Three possible valid values are provided as child nodes: [EmployeeTerritories.EmployeeID], [EmployeeTerritories.TerritoryID], and [EmployeeID.LastName]. If the value does not match one of these, an exception will be thrown, halting further execution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Enforcing that an aggregation function only operates on specific, pre-approved columns in a reporting endpoint.
 * - Preventing SQL injection or runtime errors by restricting column choices to a fixed set.
 * - Providing a safeguard in multi-tenant APIs where only certain database columns should be exposed for aggregations.
 * - Guiding consumers of an API to select only supported column names for aggregate queries.
