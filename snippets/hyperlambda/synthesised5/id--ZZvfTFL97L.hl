/*
 * 1. The [pgsql.connect] slot establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database using the connection string or alias named [etl].
 * 2. The [pgsql.execute] slot executes the SQL statement "drop table if exists temp_import" on the connected PostgreSQL database, deleting the [temp_import] table if it exists.
 * 3. The [yield] slot returns a response containing a [message] node indicating that the temporary table has been dropped.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Resetting or cleaning up a temporary table before running an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
 * - Ensuring that a specific table does not exist before attempting to create it again in a migration script.
 * - Providing a clear response message to an API consumer or calling process after a maintenance operation on the database.
 * - Automating database cleanup tasks as part of a scheduled maintenance workflow.
