/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates over every child node of [.words], and for each node, it executes its child logic.
 * 2. Inside the loop, [set-value] targets the currently iterated node (accessed by reference with `@.dp/#`), updating its value.
 * 3. The new value assigned is the result of [strings.to-lower], which converts the original value of the currently iterated node to all lowercase letters.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Normalize a list of words to lowercase before further processing, such as searching or comparison.
 * - Prepare user-provided keyword lists for case-insensitive operations.
 * - Sanitize input data where consistency in letter casing is required.
