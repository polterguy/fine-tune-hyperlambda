/*
 * 1. The [exists] slot checks if the expression `:x:-/*` returns one or more nodes. In this case, it will evaluate whether the parent node of [exists] (which is likely [.dest]) has any children nodes.
 * 2. If the [.dest] node contains child nodes (such as [foo] and [bar]), [exists] will return true. If there are no children, it will return false.
 * 3. The expression `:x:-/*` navigates to the parent node and selects all of its children for evaluation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To verify that a collection node (like [.dest]) is not empty before processing its children.
 * - As a condition in an [if] block to execute some logic only if a node has children.
 * - To dynamically check if a data structure has been populated before performing further operations.
 * - Useful for validation steps in workflows that require at least one child node to proceed.
