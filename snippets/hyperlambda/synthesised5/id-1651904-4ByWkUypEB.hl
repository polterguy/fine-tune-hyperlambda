/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.sql] node with the result of its child slot.
 * 2. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates several string parts together to form a single SQL statement.
 * 3. [get-value] is used to retrieve the values of [.arguments] child nodes named [tableName] and [fkName], which are then inserted into the SQL statement.
 * 4. The static string nodes provide the fixed parts of the SQL command: "alter table " and " drop constraint ".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically generate a SQL statement to drop a foreign key constraint from a table, using table and constraint names provided at runtime.
 * - Automate database schema updates by constructing SQL commands based on user input or configuration.
 * - Prepare SQL statements for execution in migration scripts or administrative tools where table and constraint names are variable.
