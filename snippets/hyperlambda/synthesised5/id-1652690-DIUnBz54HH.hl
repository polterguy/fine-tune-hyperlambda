/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return data from a dynamic slot, endpoint, or file. It evaluates its child expressions and returns the result to the caller.
 * 2. The [orders] node is populated with the result of the expression `:x:@data.read/*`, which retrieves all child nodes of the [data.read] node.
 * 3. The effect is that the response will contain an [orders] node with all the children of [data.read] as its value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a list of orders from a data source to an API response.
 * - Exposing all records read from a database or file as the output of an endpoint.
 * - Wrapping a collection of items in a named node for client consumption.
