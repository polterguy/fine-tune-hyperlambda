/*
 * 1. The [and] slot is used to logically combine multiple conditions, ensuring that all child conditions must be true for the entire [and] block to evaluate to true.
 * 2. The [documents.client_id:client_id.client_id] node specifies a condition where the [client_id] column in the [documents] table must match the [client_id] column in the [client_id] table.
 * 3. This structure is typically used within a join or where clause to enforce referential integrity or filter rows where related key values are equal.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Ensuring only rows where [documents] are linked to an existing [client_id] are selected in a query.
 * - Defining join conditions in SQL to match foreign key relationships between tables.
 * - Filtering results to display only documents belonging to a specific client in a dashboard or report.
