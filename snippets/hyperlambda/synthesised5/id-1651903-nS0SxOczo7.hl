/*
 * 1. The [io.file.save] slot saves content to a file on disk, overwriting any existing content or creating a new file if it doesn't exist.
 * 2. The `:x:@strings.concat` expression means the file path is dynamically determined by evaluating the result of [strings.concat].
 * 3. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [.arguments] node's [sql] child and provides it as the file content.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically generate a file path by concatenating strings and save SQL content to that file.
 * - Save SQL queries or scripts received as arguments into a file with a programmatically constructed name.
 * - Automate exporting SQL statements to files with names based on runtime data or user input.
