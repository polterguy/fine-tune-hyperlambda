 * 1. The [not] slot inverts the boolean result of its child condition, so it will return true if the child condition is false, and vice versa.
 * 2. The [strings.starts-with] slot checks if the value of the [url] node inside [.arguments] starts with the string "http://".
 * 3. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/url` points to the [url] node within [.arguments].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To validate that a URL does not begin with "http://", for example to enforce HTTPS-only URLs.
 * - As part of a conditional branch to reject or handle URLs that do not start with the specified prefix.
 * - To trigger alternative logic if the provided URL does not match the required starting substring.
