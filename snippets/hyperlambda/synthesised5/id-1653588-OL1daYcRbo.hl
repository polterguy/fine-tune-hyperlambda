/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return data from a dynamic slot or endpoint. It will forward evaluate any expressions inside its children nodes before returning them.
 * 2. The [stats] node is created as a child of [yield], and its value is set to the result of the expression `:x:@http.get/*/content`, which retrieves the [content] node from all children of the [http.get] node in the current execution context.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning the content received from one or more HTTP GET requests as the [stats] node in an HTTP endpoint response.
 * - Aggregating and exposing the results of multiple [http.get] invocations for further processing or client consumption.
 * - Wrapping the HTTP response payload(s) in a [stats] node for standardized output in an API.
