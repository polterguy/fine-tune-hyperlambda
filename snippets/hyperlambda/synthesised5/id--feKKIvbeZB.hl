/*
 * 1. The [set-name] slot is used to rename all nodes matching the expression `:x:@.data/*/old-name` to a new name specified by its child node, which in this case is "new-name".
 * 2. The [set-name] slot takes one source value (the new name) and can apply it to multiple destinations (all nodes matched by the expression).
 * 3. The original value of the renamed node (in this example, "some-value") remains unchanged; only the node's name is updated from [old-name] to [new-name].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Refactoring node names in a data segment to match a new schema or naming convention.
 * - Cleaning up or unifying inconsistent node names across different parts of a Hyperlambda structure.
 * - Preparing data for export, ensuring that node names conform to required external formats.
 * - Migrating legacy data where old naming patterns need to be systematically updated.
