/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot is used here to concatenate multiple strings into a single string value. Its expression `:x:@.sql` targets a node named [.sql].
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the [.sql] node, ensuring its current value is included in the concatenation.
 * 3. The child node [.:) as keyword_count] is a static string appended after the value from [.sql], resulting in a new string that combines the original SQL fragment with the literal ") as keyword_count".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically appending SQL fragments (such as aggregate function aliases) to an existing SQL statement stored in [.sql].
 * - Generating an SQL column definition with a computed alias on the fly.
 * - Preparing SQL queries with dynamic components for reporting or data analytics scenarios.
 * - Building complex SQL statements for subsequent execution in a database slot.
