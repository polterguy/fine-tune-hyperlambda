/*
 * 1. The [add] slot appends a new child node to the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.dp/#`. The `#` iterator ensures the node is passed by reference, so the modification affects the original node.
 * 2. The child node being added is unnamed (represented by a single dot), and it contains a single child node named [bestseller] with a boolean value of false.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Add a [bestseller] flag to each node in a collection, marking them as not a bestseller by default.
 * - Initialize a property for a set of product or book nodes during data import or transformation.
 * - Dynamically extend nodes with additional metadata for later processing or filtering.
