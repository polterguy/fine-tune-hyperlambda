/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `@.fields`. It evaluates the expression, locates the [fields] node in the current execution context, and returns its value.
 * 
 * 2. This slot does not alter the node or its content; it simply reads the value for consumption in further processing, conditional checks, or output.
 * 
 * 3. If the [fields] node does not exist or has a null value, [get-value] will return null.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting user input or form data stored in a [fields] node for validation or processing.
 * - Using the value of [fields] as an argument to another slot, such as for logging or database operations.
 * - Dynamically including the value of [fields] in a response or output template.
