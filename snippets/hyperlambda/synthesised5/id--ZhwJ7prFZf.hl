/*
 * 1. The [switch] slot evaluates the value of the [.status] node and matches it against its [case] children.
 * 2. If the value matches the [case:in-stock], it sets the [.message] node to "Car part is in stock" using [set-value].
 * 3. If the value matches [case:out-of-stock], it updates [.message] to "Car part is out of stock".
 * 4. If the value matches none of the [case] nodes, the [default] block sets [.message] to "Unknown status".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Displaying user-friendly messages about inventory status based on a product's state.
 * - Returning appropriate API responses for different stock conditions in an e-commerce or warehouse application.
 * - Handling unexpected or new status values gracefully by providing a default message.
