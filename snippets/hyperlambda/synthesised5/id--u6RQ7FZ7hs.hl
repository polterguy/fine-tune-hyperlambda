/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a connection to the [messaging_db] database, specifying that its [database-type] is SQLite.
 * 2. The [data.select] slot executes a SQL query to retrieve the latest 100 entries from the [chat_logs] table, ordering them by [timestamp] in descending order. The query is explicitly set to use the SQLite dialect through the [database-type] argument.
 * 3. The [add] slot appends the result of the [data.select] query (the records retrieved) to the [.result] node. It uses the [get-nodes] slot with the expression `:x:@data.select/*` to extract all child nodes (records) from the [data.select] result and add them under [.result].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve and aggregate the most recent 100 chat messages from a SQLite-based chat application's message log for display or processing.
 * - Export the latest chat logs from the [messaging_db] database into another node structure for further analysis or transformation.
 * - Use the resulting node structure for synchronizing chat history with another service or for archival purposes.
 * - Display the most recent chat activity to an administrator or user in a dashboard application.
