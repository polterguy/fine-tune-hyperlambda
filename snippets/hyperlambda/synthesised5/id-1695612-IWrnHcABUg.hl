/*
 * 1. The [throw] slot is used to raise an exception with a custom message, in this case "Cache expired, items no longer available".
 * 2. The [status] child node sets the HTTP status code of the error response to 500, indicating an internal server error.
 * 3. The [public] child node with a boolean value of true makes the exception message visible to the client, allowing it to propagate outside of the server regardless of build configuration.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To explicitly signal to a client that a cache-related operation failed because the data has expired, and return a clear error status.
 * - In API endpoints where cache validity is essential, this pattern can inform consumers immediately when cached resources are invalid or missing.
 * - For debugging or auditing, making the error public ensures that clients receive actionable feedback about cache expiration without needing to inspect server logs.
 * - In workflows where error handling is required to trigger retries or alternative logic when cache access fails due to expiration.
