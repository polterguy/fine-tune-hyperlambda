/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node specifies two expected arguments, [arg1] of type string and [arg2] of type date, declaring the input types for the endpoint or slot.
 * 2. [validators.mandatory] is used twice with the lambda expression `:x:@.arguments/*/arg1` and `:x:@.arguments/*/arg2`, ensuring that both [arg1] and [arg2] must be present in the input; if either is missing, an exception will be thrown to stop further execution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Enforcing that both a user name ([arg1]) and a date of birth ([arg2]) are provided in a registration endpoint.
 * - Validating that both a string-based identifier and a timestamp are supplied to log an event.
 * - Ensuring API consumers always send both required parameters, preventing execution with incomplete data.
 * - Building robust endpoints that provide clear error messages when essential input is missing.
