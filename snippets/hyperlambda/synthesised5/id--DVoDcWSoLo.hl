/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot is used to open a database connection, using a connection string named "foo" from your configuration and targeting the database "bar". The syntax `[foo|bar]` specifies which connection string to use and which database to connect to, allowing flexible database context selection.
 * 2. Once the connection is established, any child slots inside [data.connect] will operate within the context of this open database connection, enabling operations like reading, writing, or executing SQL statements on the "bar" database.
 * 3. The connection automatically closes when all child operations are completed, ensuring proper resource management.
 * 
 * Typical use cases:
 * - Running a series of data manipulation commands against the "bar" database using the "foo" connection string.
 * - Wrapping database operations such as [data.read] or [data.execute] within a single connection scope for transaction-like behavior.
 * - Switching between different databases or connection configurations dynamically by changing the parameters of the [data.connect] slot.
