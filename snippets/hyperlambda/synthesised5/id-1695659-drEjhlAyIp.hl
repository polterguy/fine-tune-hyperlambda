/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates over each child node of [@signal], passing each node as a reference via the [.dp] node for use within the loop body.
 * 2. The first [add] invocation targets the grandchildren of the next sibling node relative to [for-each] by using the expression `:x:+/*/*`. It adds the children of the currently iterated node (referenced by [.dp]) into this destination.
 * 3. The second [add] invocation targets a deeply nested set of nodes under [@for-each/@for-each/@for-each/@.dp/#/*/tables/0/-/*/foreign_keys], and inserts a new node structure with two nested anonymous nodes.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Merging the structure of each child of [signal] into another part of the graph, updating related nodes dynamically.
 * - Populating foreign key collections for database table representations by appending new placeholder nodes during data transformation.
 * - Dynamically restructuring and augmenting a node tree based on input signals, such as during a schema import or synchronization process.
 * - Performing batch modifications to multiple related node collections in a single traversal, ensuring consistent updates across a complex hierarchical object.
