/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks whether the value of [.status] is not equal to "Ready" using the [neq] slot. If this condition is true, it executes its [.lambda] child, which logs an informational message indicating that [.status] is NOT Ready using [log.info].
 * 2. If the condition in [if] is false (meaning [.status] is "Ready"), the [else] slot is evaluated, which logs a different informational message stating that [.status] is Ready.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Monitoring a process and logging when its status deviates from "Ready".
 * - Auditing state transitions in a workflow by capturing when a resource is or isn't ready.
 * - Providing feedback in automation scripts regarding the readiness of a service or component.
 * - Debugging issues by logging status evaluations at key decision points.
