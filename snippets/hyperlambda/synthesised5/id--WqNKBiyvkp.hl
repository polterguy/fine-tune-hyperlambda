/*
 * 1. The [.matching] slot is used to perform a dynamic expression match, where the expression is constructed using interpolation. The expression contains embedded values, such as `{@.match/*/value}`, which will be evaluated and inserted before the expression is run.
 * 2. The expression `@.data/*/\"={@.match/*/value}\"` targets all child nodes of [.data] whose value is equal to the value(s) found under [.match]â€™s child node(s) named [value], with the result being quoted.
 * 3. By enclosing the match value in escaped quotes (`\"={...}\"`), the code ensures that only nodes with an exact quoted value match are selected by the expression.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Finding nodes in [.data] whose values exactly match a specific value or a set of values defined dynamically in [.match].
 * - Filtering a list of configuration, user, or data nodes to only those whose content equals a user-supplied or computed criteria.
 * - Dynamically referencing and retrieving nodes whose values may change at runtime, depending on other nodes' values.
 * - Implementing conditional logic that operates only on nodes matching a precise value, useful for validation or data transformation tasks.
