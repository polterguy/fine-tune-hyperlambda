/*
 * 1. The [data.delete] slot is used to delete records from a database table, in this case from the [questions] table.
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies that the operation should be performed using SQLite as the database backend.
 * 3. The [table] node indicates the name of the table from which records will be deleted, here [questions].
 * 4. The [where] node is used to define the conditions for which records should be deleted. The [and] node under [where] allows you to specify multiple conditions that must all be true for a record to be deleted. In this snippet, the specific conditions are not provided, but they would be added as children of [and].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Deleting all questions from the [questions] table that match certain criteria, such as a specific user ID and status.
 * - Removing outdated or flagged entries from a questions table in a quiz or survey application.
 * - Cleaning up test data from the [questions] table in a development or staging environment by specifying appropriate conditions under [and].
