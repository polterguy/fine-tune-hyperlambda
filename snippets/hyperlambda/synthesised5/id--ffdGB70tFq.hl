/*
 * 1. The [validators.url] slot checks if the value found at the location specified by the expression `:x:@.some-url` is a valid URL. If the value is not a valid URL, it throws an exception and halts further execution.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.some-url` points to a node named [.some-url] in the current context, whose value is then validated.
 * 3. This slot does not require any additional arguments; it only needs the expression indicating which node's value to validate.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that user input for a website field is a properly formatted URL before saving it to a database.
 * - Validating the target URL provided in an API request to prevent processing invalid or malformed URLs.
 * - Checking configuration files or environment variables to confirm that required URLs are present and correctly formatted.
 * - Enforcing URL format on settings for webhooks or callback URLs in a system.
