/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot deletes all nodes that are referenced by its expression argument.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.fields/*` targets all child nodes of the [.fields] node, meaning every direct child under [.fields] will be removed.
 * 3. This operation will not affect the [.fields] node itself, only its immediate children.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Clearing all field definitions from a [.fields] configuration node without deleting the [.fields] node itself.
 * - Resetting the contents of a data structure by removing all its current entries before repopulating.
 * - Dynamically modifying the graph by removing nodes based on context or user actions, such as clearing form fields.
 * - Preparing a node to receive new data by ensuring it is empty before inserting new children.
