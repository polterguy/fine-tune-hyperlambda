/*
 * 1. The [strings.trim] slot is used to remove all occurrences of the characters specified in its argument node from both the start and end of the input string.
 * 2. In this example, the value of the node being trimmed is "!#Hello#!", and the argument node provides the characters to trim, which are "!" and "#".
 * 3. As a result, all leading and trailing "!" and "#" characters are stripped, leaving only "Hello" as the result.
 * 4. The slot does not remove these characters if they appear in the middle of the stringâ€”only from the beginning and end.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up user input by removing unwanted punctuation from both ends of a string.
 * - Stripping custom delimiters from serialized data values.
 * - Preparing strings for further processing when uniform formatting is required.
