/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates all its child node values into a single string. Here, it's used with an expression pointing to [@.sql], so it combines dynamic and static content.
 * 2. [get-value] with the expression `:x:@.sql` retrieves the value of the [.sql] node and supplies it as the first part of the concatenation.
 * 3. The next child nodes provide literal strings: " from ", "documents", and " where keyword_count > 0", which are appended in sequence.
 * 4. The resulting output is a single string that assembles an SQL statement by merging a previously built query segment with additional SQL clauses.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Building SQL queries dynamically by appending table and filter information to a base query string.
 * - Creating log messages or text blocks that require dynamic parts mixed with static text.
 * - Generating file paths or URLs by combining variables and constants.
 * - Assembling command-line arguments or configuration strings from multiple data sources.
