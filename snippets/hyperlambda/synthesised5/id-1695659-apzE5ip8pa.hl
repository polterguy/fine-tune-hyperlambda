/*
 * 1. [signal] is used to dynamically invoke the slot or signal referenced by the value of the [strings.concat] node. It passes in child arguments to this invocation.
 * 2. The [connection-string] node is set to the value retrieved from the [.connection-string] node using the expression `:x:@.connection-string`.
 * 3. The [database] node is assigned the value from the [name] child of the currently iterated node, which is referenced via the [.dp/#/*/name] expression.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Dynamically constructing and invoking a signal to establish a database connection using a composed connection string and the target database name.
 * - Passing context-specific values (such as a selected database name) into a slot or signal for further processing.
 * - Automating configuration pass-throughs in scenarios where the connection string and database name may change based on user selection or some iteration.
