/*
 * 1. [insert-before] is used to insert new nodes before the node(s) referenced by its expression argument. In this case, it targets the [item1] node inside the [.list] node.
 * 2. The child node of [insert-before] is a container node with a single child [item0] whose value is "Inserted before item1". This node will be inserted directly before [item1] in [.list].
 * 3. The operation does not modify other nodes or siblings in [.list], only changes the order by placing [item0] before [item1].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Inserting a new element at the beginning of a list or ordered collection.
 * - Dynamically adding a prerequisite or header item before an existing node.
 * - Maintaining a specific sequence in a data structure by placing new elements before reference points.
