/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@.sql`, which points to the first ancestor or sibling node named [.sql]. 
 * 2. This operation extracts the actual value stored in the [.sql] node, allowing subsequent slots or logic to use or process the value as needed.
 * 3. Using [get-value] in this way is helpful when you want to dynamically reference and work with the content of a specific node elsewhere in your Hyperlambda execution tree.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the SQL statement from a [.sql] node for logging or debugging purposes.
 * - Passing the SQL query value to another slot that requires the raw SQL for further processing or execution.
 * - Building dynamic workflows where the SQL command may change depending on earlier logic or configuration nodes.
