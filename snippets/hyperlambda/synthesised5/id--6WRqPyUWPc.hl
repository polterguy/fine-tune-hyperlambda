/*
 * 1. The [sqlite.connect] slot establishes a connection to the "galaxy" SQLite database, preparing the context for subsequent database operations.
 * 2. The [sqlite.scalar] slot executes the SQL statement "select count(*) from planets" against the connected "galaxy" database. It retrieves a single scalar value representing the total number of records in the "planets" table and sets this value as the result of the [sqlite.scalar] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Quickly retrieving the total number of rows in a table for reporting or dashboard statistics.
 * - Checking if the "planets" table contains any records before performing further operations.
 * - Validating data import success by comparing expected and actual row counts.
 * - Implementing pagination by first obtaining the total record count in the "planets" table.
