/*
 * 1. The [sort] slot is invoked with the value [price_asc], which typically refers to a sorting operation based on ascending price order.
 * 2. [sort] expects an expression leading to a list of nodes to sort, and a lambda object that defines the comparison logic between two nodes ([.lhs] and [.rhs]), setting the [.result] node to determine their order.
 * 3. In this code, only the [sort] slot is shown with the value [price_asc], so it assumes that elsewhere in the execution tree, there is a node set to be sorted and a lambda object (likely named [price_asc]) that implements the comparison logic for sorting by price in ascending order.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Sorting a list of products by their price in ascending order before displaying them in a web application.
 * - Organizing search results or catalog items so that the least expensive options appear first.
 * - Preparing a report or export where items need to be ordered by price from lowest to highest.
