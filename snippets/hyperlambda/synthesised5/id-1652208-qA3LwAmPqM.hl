/*
 * 1. The [data.delete] slot is used to delete records from a database table, in this case from the [Employees] table.
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies that the database is of type "sqlite".
 * 3. The [table] node indicates the target table for the delete operation, which is [Employees].
 * 4. The [where] node, combined with the [and] node, is used to define the conditions that must be met for records to be deleted. However, since no conditions are specified under [and], this would result in either no records being deleted or potentially all records being deleted, depending on the implementation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Deleting all records from the [Employees] table in a SQLite database (if no conditions are added under [and]).
 * - Preparing a template for a conditional delete operation where specific conditions will later be added under [and].
 * - Demonstrating the structure of a delete operation in Hyperlambda for SQLite databases.
