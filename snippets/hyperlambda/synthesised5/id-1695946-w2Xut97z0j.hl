/*
 * 1. The [strings.join] slot concatenates the values of all child nodes under [.fields], inserting the string " || " as a separator between each value.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.fields/*` retrieves every immediate child node of [.fields] to be joined.
 * 3. The separator node with value " || " is provided as the first child to [strings.join], specifying exactly what will appear between each joined value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Constructing a SQL SELECT statement by joining column names with " || " to create a concatenated expression.
 * - Generating a display string where multiple field values need to be shown together separated by " || ".
 * - Building a custom log entry where several values are joined for easier reading or parsing.
 * - Formatting a message by joining several user-provided fields with a visible delimiter for output.
