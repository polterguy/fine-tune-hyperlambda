/*
 * 1. The [set-name] slot changes the name of all nodes returned from the expression `:+/+/*/*` to the result of its single child source.
 * 2. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates the value of a node named [.@p] and the value of a node referenced by [.no] to create a new string, which is used as the new name for the target nodes.
 * 3. The `:+/+/*/*` expression navigates two sibling levels downward and then selects all children of those nodes, targeting potentially many nodes for renaming within a complex tree.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically renaming deeply nested nodes in a data structure based on runtime values.
 * - Creating unique or descriptive node names by combining contextual values from different parts of the tree.
 * - Mass-renaming nodes after data import or transformation to enforce a naming convention.
 * - Preparing a dataset for further processing where node names must encode specific information from sibling nodes.
