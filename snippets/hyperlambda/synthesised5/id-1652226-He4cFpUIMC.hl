/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to broadcast a signal named [northwind.Order Details.delete] to all subscribers. This allows real-time notification or event-driven communication between clients or services.
 * 2. The [args] node is included as a child, which can be used to pass additional arguments or data as a JSON object to the subscribers of the signal. In this example, [args] is empty, so no extra data is transmitted.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Notify connected clients in real time that an order detail has been deleted in the Northwind system, allowing them to update their UI accordingly.
 * - Trigger downstream business logic or workflows in other services or microservices that need to react when an order detail is deleted.
 * - Broadcast audit or logging events to monitoring systems whenever a delete operation occurs on order details.
