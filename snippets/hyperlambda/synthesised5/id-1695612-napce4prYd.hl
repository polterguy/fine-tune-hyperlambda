/*
 * 1. [get-first-value] checks its child nodes in order and returns the first non-null value it finds.
 * 2. The first child is a [get-value] slot, which tries to retrieve the value from the node specified by the expression `:x:@http.post/*/content/*/choices/0/*/message/*/content`.
 * 3. The second child is a node with an empty value, which acts as a fallback default if the previous [get-value] does not yield a value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning the first valid response from a chain of possible sources, with a fallback to a default value if none are found.
 * - Handling API responses where a certain field might not always be present, ensuring that a non-null value is always returned.
 * - Simplifying error handling by providing a default output when data is missing or incomplete.
