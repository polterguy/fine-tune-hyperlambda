/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return values from a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint. It evaluates its children and returns the result to the caller.
 * 2. The [result] node is created as a child of [yield], and its value is set to the values of all nodes matching the expression `:x:@data.read/*`, which means it collects the values of all child nodes of [data.read].
 * 3. The use of the expression `:x:@data.read/*` means that all direct children of the [data.read] node are included in the [result] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning the results of a data read operation from a dynamic slot or endpoint.
 * - Aggregating multiple values from the children of [data.read] and returning them as a single result node.
 * - Providing a standardized output structure for consumers expecting a [result] node containing the read data.
