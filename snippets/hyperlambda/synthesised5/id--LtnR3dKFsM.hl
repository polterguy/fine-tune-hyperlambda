/*
 * 1. [add]: This slot appends nodes to the children collection of one or more destination nodes. Here, it targets [.target] and adds new child nodes to it.
 * 2. [get-nodes]: This slot retrieves the child nodes of [.sourceA] and [.sourceB]. Each invocation returns all direct children nodes of the specified source.
 * 3. [.sourceA], [.sourceB], [.target]: These are container nodes that hold key-value pairs or serve as destinations for added nodes.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Merging data from multiple sources into a unified result node for further processing.
 * - Dynamically constructing a list of configuration or parameter nodes by aggregating several sources into a single collection.
 * - Building a consolidated response node in an API endpoint by combining data from various temporary structures.
 * - Aggregating user preferences or settings from multiple modules into one central location for easy access.
