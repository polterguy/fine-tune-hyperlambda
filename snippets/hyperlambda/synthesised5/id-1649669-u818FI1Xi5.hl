/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return data from a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint. It evaluates its child expressions and returns their results to the caller.
 * 2. The [result] node is created as a child of [yield], and its value is set to the value referenced by the expression `:x:@.profile.result`. This means it will return the value of the [result] node that is a child of the [.profile] node in the current execution context.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning the result of a user profile operation, such as fetching or updating profile information, to an API client.
 * - Providing a standardized response structure from a dynamic slot that processes profile data.
 * - Wrapping the output of a computation or lookup related to user profiles for further processing or direct consumption by the caller.
