 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of every direct child node at the current level, as referenced by the `*` expression.
 * 2. The single child node with the name [.] provides the new value, which is "oops".
 * 3. After execution, all immediate child nodes of the current context will have their values set to "oops".
 * 
 * Use cases:

 * - Resetting all configuration parameters at a certain level to a default or placeholder value.
 * - Marking every child item in a list as invalid or requiring attention in a workflow or validation process.
