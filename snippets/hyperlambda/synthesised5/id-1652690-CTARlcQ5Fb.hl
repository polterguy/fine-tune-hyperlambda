/*
 * 1. The [include] slot is used to execute the children of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@data.read/*` and include their results in the current execution context.
 * 2. The [data.read] slot is used to select records from the [Order] table, specifically retrieving the [OrderId] and [OrderDate] columns.
 * 3. The [where] clause uses an [and] condition to filter results, selecting only those records where the [CustomerId] column is equal to the value referenced by the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/CustomerId`.
 * 4. The [yield] slot is used to return the results of the [data.read] operation as a node named [orders].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching all orders for a specific customer, where the customer ID is dynamically provided from a parent or context node.
 * - Including order data as part of a larger data retrieval process, such as when building a customer profile that includes recent orders.
 * - Returning a filtered list of orders in an API response, where only the order ID and date are needed for further processing or display.
