 * 1. The [io.file.load] slot loads the contents of the file specified by its value, in this case [/modules/fine-tune-hyperlambda/system-message-synthesiser.md], into the current node structure.
 * 2. The slot allows dynamic reading of static files, making their content available as a node value for further processing within the Hyperlambda graph.
 * 3. This operation is commonly used as a first step before parsing, transforming, or extracting data from the loaded file.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically loading documentation or configuration files to be parsed and executed at runtime.
 * - Fetching prompt or system message templates for fine-tuning or AI prompt engineering workflows.
 * - Reading Markdown or text content from disk to be delivered via an HTTP API endpoint or injected into a dynamic web page.
