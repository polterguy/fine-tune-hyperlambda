/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the values of all nodes referenced by the expression `:x:@.headers/*`, which means it will return the values of all child nodes of the [headers] node.
 * 2. The `@.headers/*` expression specifically targets every direct child node under the [headers] node, so [get-value] will collect the value of each header (e.g., header values like "text/html" or "application/json").
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting all HTTP header values from a [headers] node after constructing or receiving an HTTP request or response.
 * - Collecting configuration values from a group of settings stored as child nodes under a [headers] node.
 * - Aggregating all values from a named collection node to process or log them further in your workflow.
