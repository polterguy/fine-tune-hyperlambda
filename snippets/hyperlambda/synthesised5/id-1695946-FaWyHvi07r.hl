/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the node named [.sql] in the current execution context, as specified by the expression `:x:@.sql`.
 * 2. The expression `@.sql` is used to locate the first ancestor or sibling node named [.sql], and [get-value] then extracts its value and returns it.
 * 3. This slot is often used to pass values between nodes or slots, making it useful for scenarios where you need to reference the result of a previous operation or a parameter stored in [.sql].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the SQL query string stored in [.sql] for use in dynamic database operations.
 * - Passing the value of [.sql] as an argument to another slot that requires a raw SQL statement.
 * - Logging or debugging by retrieving and displaying the value of [.sql] elsewhere in the workflow.
 * - Using the value of [.sql] as a template to build further SQL commands or expressions dynamically.
