/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to add a new child node to the node set referenced by the expression `:x:@data.connect/*/data.read/*/where/*/and`. This means it targets all [and] nodes that are descendants of [where], which in turn are descendants of [data.read] nodes under [data.connect].
 * 2. The child node being added is an unnamed node (name is [.]), which itself contains a child node named [type.eq]. The value of [type.eq] is set dynamically to the value of the [type] node under [.arguments] using the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/type`.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically add a type-based equality filter to all [and] conditions within [where] clauses of a data read operation, based on a provided argument.
 * - Extend a query's filtering logic at runtime to include a type comparison, without modifying the original query structure.
 * - Apply user-supplied or context-dependent type constraints to SQL queries generated through Hyperlambda data access patterns.
