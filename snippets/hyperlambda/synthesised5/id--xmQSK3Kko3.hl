/*
 * 1. The [strings.capitalize] slot takes the value of the node, which is the string "42hello", and transforms only the very first character into uppercase, if it is a letter. Since the first character here is "4" (a digit), it remains unchanged, so the string output will be "42hello".
 * 2. This operation does not alter any other characters in the string, nor does it affect numbers or symbols at the start of the string.
 * 3. The slot is useful for normalizing user input or data, especially when you want only the initial character to potentially be capitalized, regardless of its type.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Displaying usernames or identifiers that may start with numbers, ensuring the first alphabetic character is capitalized if present.
 * - Preparing strings for formatting where a capital letter is expected at the beginning, but the input might not start with a letter.
 * - Sanitizing data fields before presenting them in reports or UIs, while leaving leading numbers untouched.
