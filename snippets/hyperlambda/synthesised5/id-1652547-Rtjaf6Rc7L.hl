/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return a value or node set from a dynamic slot or endpoint. In this case, it returns the result of the expression `:x:@json2lambda/*`.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@json2lambda/*` retrieves all child nodes of the [json2lambda] node, effectively unwrapping the lambda structure that was created from a JSON input.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a lambda object representation of a JSON string as the output of an HTTP endpoint or dynamic slot.
 * - Converting JSON data to lambda format and exposing its properties directly to downstream logic.
 * - Facilitating further processing or transformation of JSON-derived data within a Hyperlambda workflow.
