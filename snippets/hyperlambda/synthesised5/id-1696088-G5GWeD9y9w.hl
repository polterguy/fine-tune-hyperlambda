/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the node specified by the expression. In this case, the expression `:x:@.sql` points to the first ancestor or sibling node named [.sql].
 * 2. The slot returns the raw value (not the children, just the value) of the [.sql] node it finds.
 * 3. If the [.sql] node does not exist in the current context, [get-value] will return null.
 * 
 * Example use cases:
 * - Extracting the generated SQL string from a previously executed [sql.*] slot to log or further process it.
 * - Fetching a dynamically created SQL command for display in a debug output panel.
 * - Passing the value of [.sql] as a parameter to another slot that requires the SQL statement as input.
 * - Using the value of [.sql] to compare or validate generated SQL queries against expected patterns in a unit test.
