/*
 * 1. The [date.from-unix] slot converts the Unix timestamp value (1672531200) into a typed date object, representing the corresponding UTC date and time.
 * 2. The [yield] slot returns the result of the conversion, exposing it as a [readable-date] node whose value is obtained dynamically from the output of [date.from-unix] using the expression `:x:@date.from-unix`.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Transforming Unix timestamps received from APIs or databases into human-readable date objects for further formatting or processing.
 * - Building endpoints that accept Unix timestamps and return formatted date strings for use in front-end applications.
 * - Validating and converting timestamps within workflow automation or scheduled task systems.
 * - Logging or auditing events with both raw Unix time and a readable date for easier traceability.
