/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used here with the expression `:x:+/*/*`, which means it will add nodes as children to all grandchildren of the next sibling node at the current level.
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all nodes referenced by the expression `:x:@http.get/*/content/*`, which means it collects all child nodes of the [content] node(s) that are children of any node under [http.get].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To append the content retrieved from an HTTP GET request into multiple locations in a data structure, specifically as children of certain nodes.
 * - To dynamically merge or inject remote data (such as HTML or JSON fragments) into an existing node tree after fetching it from an external API.
 * - To automate the population of multiple sections in a document or response with data fetched from an HTTP endpoint.
