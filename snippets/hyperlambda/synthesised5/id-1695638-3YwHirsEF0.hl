/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot is used to delete nodes from the current lambda node graph.
 * 2. The expression `:x:../*/return/*/snippets` targets all [snippets] nodes that are descendants of any child node of a parent node relative to the current node, specifically under a [return] node.
 * 3. After execution, any [snippets] nodes found within the targeted path will be removed from the node graph, effectively cleaning up or hiding these nodes from further processing.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Removing [snippets] nodes from API responses before returning data to clients.
 * - Cleaning up temporary data or code fragments after processing user input.
 * - Ensuring that sensitive or unnecessary code snippets are not included in exported data.
