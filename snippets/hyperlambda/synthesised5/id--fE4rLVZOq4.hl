/*
 * 1. The [strings.starts-with] slot checks if the string value of the node referenced by [@.text] starts with the value retrieved from [@.prefix].
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [.prefix] node, which is then used as the prefix to check against the [.text] value.
 * 3. The lambda expression `:x:@.text` points to the [.text] node, whose value is "Sample".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating user input to ensure it begins with a required prefix.
 * - Filtering a list of strings to include only those starting with a dynamic prefix.
 * - Implementing search or autocomplete functionality where suggestions must start with a given substring.
 * - Simple string matching in data transformation or ETL processes.
