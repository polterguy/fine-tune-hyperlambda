/*
 * 1. The [image.crop] slot crops an image file by specifying how many pixels to remove from its edges.
 * 2. The [file] node identifies the input image file to process, in this case [file] is set to "/input.jpg".
 * 3. The [left] and [right] nodes define the number of pixels to remove from the left and right sides of the image, both set to 500 pixels here.
 * 4. The slot will process the image, removing 500 pixels from each horizontal side and returning the cropped image as output (unless a [dest] argument is provided elsewhere).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Remove unwanted borders or whitespace from a scanned document by cropping equal pixels from left and right.
 * - Focus on the central area of a large panoramic image by trimming the sides.
 * - Prepare a photo for a specific format by ensuring the width matches a target area after cropping.
 * - Automate image preprocessing before applying further transformations, such as resizing or format conversion.
