 * 1. The [add] slot adds the result of its children nodes to the [.words] node, effectively appending new nodes or values to [.words].
 * 2. The [strings.split] slot takes the value from the [query] node inside [.arguments], splits it into separate strings wherever a space (" ") is found, and produces a set of nodes, each containing one word from the original query string.
 * 3. The resulting set of words is then added as children nodes to [.words].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Tokenizing a search query into individual words for further processing, such as filtering or scoring.
 * - Splitting user input into keywords to support features like autocomplete or search suggestions.
 * - Preparing a list of separate tags from a space-separated string for storage or analysis.
 * - Breaking down a sentence into individual terms for text analysis or machine learning preprocessing.
