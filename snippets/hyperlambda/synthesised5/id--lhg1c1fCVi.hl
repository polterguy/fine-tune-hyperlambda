 * 1. The [set-value] slot sets the value of the [.body] node by concatenating a static string, the value of the [.phone] node from [.arguments], and another static string using [strings.concat].
 * 2. The [unwrap] slot evaluates the content of the sibling [content] node, ensuring any embedded expressions are resolved before sending the email.
 * 3. The [mail.smtp.send] slot sends an HTML email to the specified recipient, using the value of [.body] as the email's content.
