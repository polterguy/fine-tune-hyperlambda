/*
 * 1. The [not-null] slot checks if the node(s) at the location specified by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/prefix-url` exist and have a non-null value. If at least one such node is present and its value is not null, [not-null] evaluates to true; otherwise, it evaluates to false.
 * 2. The expression `@.arguments/*/prefix-url` navigates to the [prefix-url] child node(s) of all nodes under [.arguments], making this check useful when multiple argument objects may be present.
 * 3. This slot is typically used as part of input validation or conditional logic to ensure that a required argument has been provided and is not empty before continuing with further processing.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Verifying that a required URL prefix is supplied in API request arguments before constructing a complete URL.
 * - Enforcing that user input for a specific field is not missing in a form submission.
 * - Conditionally executing logic only when a configuration parameter like [prefix-url] has been set by the caller.
