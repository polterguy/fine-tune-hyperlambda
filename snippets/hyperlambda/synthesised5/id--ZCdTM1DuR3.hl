/*
 * 1. The [.smtpHost] node is used to store the SMTP host value.
 * 2. The [set-value] slot assigns a value to the previous sibling node (which is [.smtpHost]) based on the result of a configuration fetch.
 * 3. The [config.get] slot retrieves the SMTP host from the application's configuration using the key `"mail:smtp:host"`.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically loading the SMTP host address from configuration so credentials are not hardcoded.
 * - Preparing email-related logic by injecting configuration values at runtime.
 * - Centralizing server connection information to simplify deployment changes.
 * - Supporting multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) without modifying code by relying on external configuration.
