/*
 * 1. [get-value] is used to retrieve the value of a specific node within a collection. Here, it uses the expression `:x:@.matrix/*/candidate2` to find and return the value of a node named [candidate2] that is a child of any child node under [.matrix].
 * 2. [.matrix] organizes several candidate nodes ([candidate1], [candidate2], [candidate3]) as children, each with a string value.
 * 3. The expression leverages the `*` iterator to target all children under [.matrix], then filters to the [candidate2] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting a specific candidate's name from a list of candidates for display or processing.
 * - Dynamically referencing and returning the value of a certain node within a data matrix structure.
 * - Using the result as a variable in further conditional logic or output.
