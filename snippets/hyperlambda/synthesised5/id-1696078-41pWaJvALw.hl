/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression provided in its value argument. In this case, `:x:@.sql` points to a node named [.sql] at the same level as [get-value].
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.sql` uses the `@` iterator to select the first node named [.sql] in the current context.
 * 3. The result of executing this code will be the value stored in the [.sql] node, which could be any type of data (e.g., a string containing SQL, a result object, etc.).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the SQL statement or result from a previously generated [.sql] node for further processing, logging, or output.
 * - Passing the value of [.sql] as an argument to another slot or operation.
 * - Dynamically retrieving and using SQL queries or responses within more complex workflows.
