/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to send a SignalR message to all clients subscribed to the channel specified by the value of the [channel] node inside [.arguments]. This allows dynamic targeting of channels based on input arguments.
 * 2. The [roles] node restricts the message delivery to users who have the "root" role, ensuring only privileged users receive the message.
 * 3. The [args] node contains a [message] child whose value is dynamically set to the value of the [execute] node, allowing the message content to be determined by the result of a previous execution or operation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Broadcasting the result of a server-side operation to all administrators in real time.
 * - Sending notifications to a privileged group of users on a dynamically selected channel.
 * - Relaying the output of a command or task to a SignalR-connected dashboard for root users.
