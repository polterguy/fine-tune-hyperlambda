/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot initiates a SQL data retrieval operation from a database, with [database-type] set to "sqlite", specifying the use of an SQLite database.
 * 2. The [table] node targets the [documents] table as the main table for the query.
 * 3. The [join] node joins the [clients] table to [documents], using a left join, with the [as] argument setting an alias of "client_id" for the [clients] table, and the [on] node specifying the join condition to match [documents.client_id] to [client_id.client_id].
 * 4. The [columns] node specifies which columns to retrieve, using an aggregate function (represented by [aggregate_functor]) and assigning its result an alias of "result".
 * 5. The [where] node is present but empty except for an [and] node, indicating a placeholder for future filter conditions.
 * 6. The [group] node indicates a GROUP BY clause using [group_column], so results will be aggregated based on this column.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Generating grouped aggregate reports from the [documents] table, such as counts or sums per [group_column], while joining related client data.
 * - Performing LEFT JOIN queries in SQLite to include all documents, even those without matching client records.
 * - Dynamically constructing SQL queries with aggregation and grouping, with flexibility to add filtering conditions later.
 * - Supporting reporting features in applications that need summary statistics grouped by a specific field and related client information.
