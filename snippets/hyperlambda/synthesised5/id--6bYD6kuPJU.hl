/*
 * 1. The [mail.smtp.send] slot is used to send an email through an SMTP server.
 * 2. The [server] node specifies SMTP connection details such as [host], [port], [secure], [username], and [password]. All of these can be overridden or omitted if set in configuration.
 * 3. The [message] node structures the email to be sent, with child nodes for [to], [from], [subject], and [entity].
 * 4. The [to] and [from] nodes use a structure with [name] and [email] sub-nodes, allowing explicit definition of sender and recipient details.
 * 5. The [entity] node defines the MIME content type ("text/plain") for the email body, and its [content] child node provides the plain text message.
 * 
 * Sample use cases:
 * - Sending a transactional or notification email using specific SMTP credentials, bypassing application defaults.
 * - Delivering emails with custom sender and recipient names and addresses, useful for personalized communication.
 * - Implementing programmatic email sending for contact forms or automated alerts in a business app.
 * - Testing SMTP configuration by sending an email with explicit server connection parameters.
