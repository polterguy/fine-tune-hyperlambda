/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks if the value of the previous sibling node (referenced by `:x:-`) evaluates to boolean true. If true, it executes its lambda content.
 * 2. Inside [if], [set-value] sets the value of [.result] to "Yup!".
 * 3. The [else] slot executes only if the [if] condition was false, and sets the value of [.result] to "Nope!" using [set-value].
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Conditionally update the value of [.result] based on the value of a nearby node.
 * - Implement feature toggles or flags by checking the state of a sibling node.
 * - Provide alternative outcomes or default responses depending on prior logic or input values.
 * - Branch workflow execution paths in response to dynamic data in sibling nodes.
