/*
 * 1. The [.message] node is being created with a value of "Hello, World!".
 * 2. This code simply establishes a data node without invoking any slots or logic.
 * 3. The node name starts with a ".", which conventionally designates it as a data segment in Hyperlambda, not intended for execution by [eval].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Storing a greeting message to be used later in a dynamic slot or HTTP response.
 * - Providing a static text value for testing string manipulations elsewhere in a lambda graph.
 * - Serving as a placeholder for localization or internationalization efforts where messages are swapped dynamically.
