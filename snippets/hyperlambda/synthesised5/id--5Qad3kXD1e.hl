/*
 * 1. The [io.file.copy] slot is used to copy the file specified in its value (`/videos/movie.mp4`) to a new location and name provided as the value of its child node (`/backup/movie_backup.mp4`).  
 * 2. The slot first checks that the source file exists and that the destination folder `/backup/` already exists.  
 * 3. If a file named `movie_backup.mp4` already exists in the destination, it will be deleted before copying the new file.  
 * 4. The operation only copies the fileâ€™s content; it does not move or delete the original source file.  
 * 5. The child node (containing the destination path) is evaluated before the copy takes place, allowing for dynamic path resolution if needed.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Backing up a video file before making changes or processing it further.
 * - Creating a duplicate copy of a media file for archival or sharing purposes.
 * - Automating media management tasks, such as keeping a synchronized backup folder.
 * - Preparing a file for manual review or transfer to another system without affecting the original.
