/*
 * 1. The [crypto.seed] slot is invoked with a custom string value, which is used to add entropy to the cryptographically secure random number generator (CSRNG) in the system.
 * 2. By providing a unique or unpredictable seed value, the randomness of all future cryptographic operations—such as key generation or random data creation—is improved, making it much harder for an attacker to predict outcomes.
 * 3. Each invocation of [crypto.seed] is cumulative, meaning it continues to increase the entropy every time it is called, rather than replacing the previous seed.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - After application startup, a user can provide a new seed phrase to enhance the security of cryptographic operations.
 * - Before generating sensitive keys (e.g., RSA or AES), an administrator can run [crypto.seed] with additional randomness gathered from user input.
 * - In multi-tenant systems, each tenant could add their own entropy to further isolate and protect their cryptographic materials.
 * - Occasionally, operators can reseed the CSRNG as part of regular security maintenance routines.
