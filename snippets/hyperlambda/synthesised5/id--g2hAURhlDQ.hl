/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates over each child node of [.data], passing each node by reference as [.dp].
 * 2. Inside each loop iteration, the [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the currently referenced node ([.dp]), which will be "apple", "banana", or "cherry" for each respective iteration.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting or processing values from a collection of data nodes.
 * - Generating a list of item names for display or further manipulation.
 * - Performing validations or transformations on each value within a dataset.
 * - Aggregating or logging values from each child node within a parent node.
