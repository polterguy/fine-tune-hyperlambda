/*
 * 1. The [slots.create] slot is used to define a new dynamic slot named [retBoth]. This slot, once created, can be invoked dynamically at runtime.
 * 2. Inside the [retBoth] slot, the [return] slot is used with a value of "All Good" and two child nodes: [status] with a value of "ok" and [code] with a value of 200, returning both a string and additional structured data.
 * 3. The [signal] slot is used to immediately invoke the dynamically created [retBoth] slot, executing its logic and returning the defined result.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Return both a human-readable message and structured status information from a dynamic workflow.
 * - Quickly define and execute temporary slots for custom return payloads during prototyping or testing.
 * - Encapsulate API responses with both status codes and descriptive messages inside reusable logic blocks.
