/*
 * 1. The [convert] slot is used here to change the value type of the [.input] node from bytes to string.
 * 2. The [.input] node initially contains a value of type bytes, specifically a base64-encoded string "ICA=".
 * 3. By specifying [type:string], the [convert] slot decodes the base64-encoded bytes and converts the result into a string value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Decoding base64-encoded data received from an HTTP request body into a readable string.
 * - Processing file uploads that are encoded as bytes and need to be interpreted as text content.
 * - Converting binary data from a database into a UTF-8 string for further text manipulation.
 * - Handling encoded credentials or tokens that must be decoded to string format before authentication.
 * - Transforming API responses containing base64-encoded strings into usable text for logging or display.
