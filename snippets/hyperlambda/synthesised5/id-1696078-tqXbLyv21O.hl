/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it will look for a node named [.fields] in the current scope and return its value.
 * 2. The expression uses the `@` iterator to locate the first [.fields] node, ensuring only the first match is used.
 * 3. The value returned will be whatever is currently stored in the [.fields] node, which could be any supported data type (string, int, etc.).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting input data from a [.fields] node in a form submission handler.
 * - Fetching default configuration values stored in a [.fields] node for use in further processing.
 * - Accessing a list of field names or attributes for dynamic data manipulation.
