/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to send a real-time SignalR message to all clients subscribed to the channel specified by the value of the [channel] node inside the second-level [.arguments] node. The channel name is dynamically resolved using the expression `:x:@.arguments/@.arguments/*/channel`.
 * 2. The [roles] node restricts the recipients of the signal to users who have the "root" role, ensuring only privileged users receive the message.
 * 3. The [args] node defines the payload of the message. It contains a [message] node with the static value "ERROR", and an [extra] node whose value is dynamically set to the value of the [message] node inside the first-level [.arguments] node using the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/message`.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Broadcasting an error notification to all administrators (root role) subscribed to a specific SignalR channel, with additional error details included.
 * - Sending real-time alerts to privileged users when a critical event occurs, passing both a generic error message and specific context.
 * - Notifying system operators about application errors on a per-channel basis, with the error details dynamically injected from incoming arguments.
