/*
 * 1. The [data.delete] slot is used to delete records from a database table.  
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies that the target database is of type SQLite.  
 * 3. The [table] node indicates that the operation targets the [Artist] table.  
 * 4. The [where] node, with an [and] child, is provided to define one or more conditions for which records should be deleted. However, as written, no specific field conditions are supplied under [and], so the actual deletion criteria are not defined in this snippet.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Deleting specific artists from the [Artist] table in a SQLite database based on one or more conditions (e.g., by artist name or ID).
 * - Removing records from [Artist] where multiple criteria must be met (e.g., both country and genre).
 * - As part of a larger workflow where conditional deletion of artists is required before inserting or updating related records.
