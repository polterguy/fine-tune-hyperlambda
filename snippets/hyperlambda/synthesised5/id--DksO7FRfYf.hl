/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to append nodes to the [.destination_node]. It takes as its destination argument the expression `:x:@.destination_node`, pointing to the target node where new children should be added.
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all children of the [.origin] node by using the expression `:x:@.origin/*`, which yields all nodes directly under [.origin].
 * 3. The result is that all child nodes of [.origin] ([field1], [field2], [field3]) are appended as children to [.destination_node].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Copying a set of fields from a source node to another node within a data structure.
 * - Aggregating multiple data entries from one part of a Hyperlambda object to another for further processing.
 * - Merging nodes from one collection into another to standardize data layout.
 * - Duplicating configuration or content blocks between nodes in a dynamic workflow.
