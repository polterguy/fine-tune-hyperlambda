/*
 * 1. The [exists] slot checks if the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/type` yields one or more nodes.
 * 2. If any child node named [type] exists within any child of the [.arguments] node, [exists] will return true; otherwise, it returns false.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To verify if a specific argument named [type] has been provided to an endpoint.
 * - To conditionally execute logic only if a [type] argument is present in the request.
 * - To validate the structure of input data before processing further.
