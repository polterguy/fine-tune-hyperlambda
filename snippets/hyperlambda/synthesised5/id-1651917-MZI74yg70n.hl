/*
 * 1. The [mysql.select] slot executes a raw SQL query against a MySQL database, retrieving information about foreign key constraints from the `information_schema.key_column_usage` table.
 * 2. The SQL query selects the column name (aliased as `column`), the referenced table and column, and the constraint name for all foreign key relationships for a specific table and database schema.
 * 3. The `@table` and `@database` parameters are dynamically injected into the SQL query using the values from [.arguments] nodes named [table] and [database].
 * 4. The query filters results to only include rows where the referenced column is not null, ensuring only foreign key constraints are returned, and orders the results by column name.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve all foreign key relationships for a specific table in a given database schema.
 * - Generate documentation or diagrams of table relationships in a MySQL database.
 * - Dynamically inspect or validate foreign key constraints for code generation or migration tools.
