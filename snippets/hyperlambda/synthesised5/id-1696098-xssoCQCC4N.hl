/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.sql] node with a new value.
 * 2. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates a sequence of strings, specifically the current value of the [.sql] node and the string ") as keyword_count".
 * 3. The [get-value] slot retrieves the existing value from the [.sql] node, which is then used as the first argument in the concatenation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Appending an SQL alias to an existing SQL string to count occurrences and label the result as "keyword_count".
 * - Dynamically constructing or modifying SQL queries to include additional computed columns or expressions.
 * - Automating SQL generation in reporting tools, where column aliases are added programmatically.
 * - Enhancing database query building processes by programmatically managing and expanding query strings.
