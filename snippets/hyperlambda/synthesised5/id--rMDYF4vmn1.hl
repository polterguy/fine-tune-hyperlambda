/*
 * 1. The [sqlite.connect] slot establishes a connection to the SQLite database identified by [music_store], making it possible to execute further database operations within this session.
 * 2. The [sqlite.delete] slot is used to delete records from the [albums] table. It dynamically generates and executes a SQL DELETE statement based on its child nodes.
 * 3. The [table] node specifies the target table for the delete operation, in this case [albums].
 * 4. The [where] node defines the condition for deletion. Here, it includes an [and] logical condition, which could support multiple field-value pairs, but only one is provided: [artist] equal to "The Beatles". This acts as a filter to restrict which records are deleted.
 * 5. If there were additional nodes under [and], the delete operation would only affect records matching all conditions.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Remove all albums by "The Beatles" from the [albums] table in the [music_store] SQLite database.
 * - As part of a data cleanup routine to delete outdated or unwanted artist entries.
 * - To enforce business rules, such as removing content by a specific artist upon request.
 * - For testing scenarios where selective record deletion is required to reset dataset state.
 * - In an administrative tool to allow bulk removal of an artist's discography.
