/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of all nodes referenced by the `:x:@.fields` expression.
 * 2. The new value is constructed using [strings.join], which concatenates the values of all child nodes under [.fields], inserting " || " between each value.
 * 3. The inner [strings.join] uses the expression `:x:@.fields/*` to gather all child nodes of [.fields] as the source strings to join.
 * 4. The separator argument to [strings.join] is a node with the value " || ", ensuring each original field is separated by double pipes in the resulting string.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Combine a list of SQL field names stored as children of [.fields] into a single expression separated by " || " for SQL string concatenation.
 * - Format multiple user input fields into a single string for display, using " || " as a visual separator.
 * - Aggregate data from several child nodes into a log entry or output statement, clearly separating each original value.
