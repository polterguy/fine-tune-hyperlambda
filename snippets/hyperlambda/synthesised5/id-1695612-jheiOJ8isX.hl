/*
 * 1. The [crypto.random] slot is used here to generate a cryptographically secure random string.
 * 2. The [min] and [max] child nodes are both set to 20, which ensures that the returned string will have exactly 20 characters.
 * 3. Only alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) will be included in the resulting string, making it suitable for passwords or tokens.
 * 4. This operation does not include the [raw] node, so the result will be a string rather than a byte array.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating a 20-character secure password for a user.
 * - Generating a unique API token of fixed length.
 * - Producing a consistent-length random identifier for database records.
 * - Generating a session key for cryptographic operations.
 * - Creating a secure invite code with a fixed size.
