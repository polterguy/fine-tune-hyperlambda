/*
 * 1. The [strings.contains] slot checks if the string value of its parent node ("Thomas Hansen Is Cool") includes the substring specified as its child node ("Hansen").
 * 2. The child node is used as the search term, and if it is found anywhere within the parent string, the slot returns true.
 * 3. This slot is useful for performing substring checks within a larger text, enabling conditional logic or validation based on the presence of specific words or phrases.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating if a user's full name contains a specific last name.
 * - Filtering a list of sentences to only keep those that mention a certain keyword.
 * - Implementing search functionality that highlights or processes items containing a target substring.
