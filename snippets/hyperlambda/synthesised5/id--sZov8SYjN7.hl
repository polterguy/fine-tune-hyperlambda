/*
 * 1. The [system.compile] slot compiles dynamic C# code into a .NET assembly, returning the compiled assembly as a byte array.
 * 2. The [assembly-name] node specifies the desired output filename for the assembly, which in this case is "foo.dll".
 * 3. The [references] node lists all required .NET assemblies that the C# code depends on for successful compilation, such as [netstandard], [System.Runtime], and third-party or local libraries like [magic.node] and [magic.signals.contracts].
 * 4. The [code] node contains the actual C# source code to be compiled.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Dynamically generate and load custom functionality into an application at runtime by compiling user-provided or programmatically generated C# code.
 * - Build plug-in architectures where new business logic or slots can be deployed without restarting or redeploying the main application.
 * - Create developer or admin tools that allow scripting in C# and immediate execution of new code in a safe, contained manner.
 * - Facilitate rapid prototyping or testing of new features or integrations by compiling and loading code on demand.
