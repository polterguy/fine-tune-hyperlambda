/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return values from a dynamic slot, HTTP endpoint, or executed Hyperlambda file. It signals the end of execution and specifies what data should be returned to the caller.
 * 2. The [books] node is created as a child of [yield]. Its value is set to the result of the expression `:x:@data.read/*`, which retrieves all child nodes of the [data.read] node in the current execution context.
 * 3. The effect is that the caller receives a [books] node containing all the nodes under [data.read].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a list of book records that were previously loaded or read from a data source.
 * - Serving the contents of [data.read] as a response in an HTTP API endpoint.
 * - Passing a collection of items to another part of a workflow for further processing.
