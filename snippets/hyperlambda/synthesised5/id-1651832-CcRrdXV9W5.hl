/*
 * 1. The [type] slot returns the Hyperlambda type name of its argument. In this context, it is invoked with the value "success", so the result will be the type name of the string "success".
 * 2. The slot is typically used to determine the data type of a node's value, which is useful for validation, debugging, or dynamic type handling in Hyperlambda code.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Checking the type of a value before performing type-specific operations.
 * - Debugging or logging type information for dynamic data.
 * - Validating input types in endpoints or dynamic slots.
