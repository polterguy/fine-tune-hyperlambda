/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return values from a dynamic slot or endpoint. It marks the end of execution and specifies what data should be returned to the caller.
 * 2. The [courses] node is created as a child of [yield], and its value is set to the result of the expression `:x:@data.read/*`, which retrieves all child nodes of [data.read].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a list of course objects from a data source in an HTTP API endpoint.
 * - Providing the result of a database read operation to the client in a structured format.
 * - Serving as the output for a dynamic slot that aggregates or filters course data before returning it.
