/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot deletes all nodes that match the expression `@data.select/*/*/keyword_count`, effectively removing all [keyword_count] nodes found under every child node of every child node of [data.select].
 * 2. The use of the `@` iterator at the beginning ensures that the search starts from the first [data.select] node found in the hierarchy, and the subsequent `/*/*/keyword_count` traverses two levels down and filters out nodes named [keyword_count].
 * 3. This operation is non-reversible within the same execution context, so once the [keyword_count] nodes are removed, they cannot be retrieved unless re-added or restored from another source.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Cleaning up result sets by removing specific aggregate fields like [keyword_count] before further processing or returning data to a client.
 * - Preparing a data structure for export or serialization by excluding unnecessary metadata nodes.
 * - Enforcing privacy or data minimization by stripping out sensitive or auxiliary nodes from a larger dataset.
 * - Ensuring that only relevant child nodes remain for subsequent operations such as reporting, visualization, or comparison.
