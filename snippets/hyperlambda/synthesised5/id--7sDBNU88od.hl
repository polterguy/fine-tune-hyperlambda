/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node defines the expected arguments for the endpoint, specifying that an [id] argument of type string should be provided.
 * 2. The [auth.ticket.verify] slot is called with the value "root", likely verifying that the caller possesses appropriate authentication or privileges before proceeding.
 * 3. The [validators.mandatory] slot checks that the [id] argument exists in the [.arguments] collection, throwing an exception if it is missing.
 * 4. The [log.get] slot retrieves log information associated with the provided [id] value from the arguments.
 * 5. The [return-nodes] slot returns the result of the [log.get] operation to the caller, using the previous sibling node as its source.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Securely fetching log details for a specific [id] while ensuring the requester is authenticated as a root user.
 * - Validating the presence of required parameters before attempting to access sensitive log data.
 * - Providing a protected API endpoint for administrators to retrieve logs by ID.
 * - Enforcing argument and authentication checks in a logging systemâ€™s query interface.
