/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node defines the expected input parameters for this logic: [firstname], [lastname], and [email], all of type string.
 * 2. The [add] slot locates the [properties] node within the [payload] of a [http.post] operation and inserts all argument nodes from [.arguments] as children of [properties]. This effectively maps the input arguments to the HTTP request payload.
 * 3. The [http.post] slot sends a POST request to the HubSpot API endpoint for creating contacts, including an [Authorization] header with a Bearer token and specifying the [Content-Type] as JSON. The request body is built dynamically from the input arguments.
 * 4. The [payload] node contains a [properties] child, which is populated with the argument nodes, forming the request data structure required by the HubSpot API.
 * 5. The [yield] slot returns a [result] node with the value "OK" to indicate successful execution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating a new contact in HubSpot using user-supplied [firstname], [lastname], and [email] via an HTTP POST request.
 * - Integrating a signup form backend to automatically send new user information to HubSpot CRM.
 * - Automating lead creation in a sales workflow by mapping form input directly to the HubSpot contact creation API.
 * - Facilitating seamless data transfer from a web application to a third-party CRM system using a dynamic Hyperlambda payload structure.
