/*
 * 1. [data.connect] establishes a connection to the [northwind] database using a generic connection and specifies [sqlite] as the database type for subsequent operations.
 * 2. [add] is used (three times) to inject argument nodes ([order], [direction], [limit], [offset], and all argument nodes for the [and] clause) from [.arguments] into appropriate places under the [data.read] node, effectively allowing dynamic filtering, ordering, paging, and more based on caller input.
 * 3. [remove-nodes] removes the [order], [direction], [limit], and [offset] nodes from [.arguments] after they have been processed, preventing duplication or conflict.
 * 4. [data.read] executes a SELECT query on the [Customers] table, retrieving a fixed set of columns, and applies any dynamically injected filter or query modifiers.
 * 5. [return-nodes] returns the result set from the [data.read] query as the output of this operation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Create an API endpoint that lists customers from the Northwind database, supporting dynamic ordering, filtering, and pagination via HTTP arguments.
 * - Enable flexible querying of the [Customers] table from a UI, where users can specify which column to sort by, how many results to return, and custom filters.
 * - Reuse this logic as a backend service for reporting tools that require customer listing with advanced search capabilities.
 * - Easily adapt the structure to support similar queries on other tables by modifying the [data.read] configuration.
