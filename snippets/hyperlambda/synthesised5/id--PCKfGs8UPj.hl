/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used here to append nodes into multiple destination nodes at once. Its main argument `:x:../*/.dest` selects all [.dest] nodes at the same level as the current node.
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot with `:x:../*/.src/*` retrieves all children of all [.src] nodes at the same level, returning nodes [key1] and [key2] from each [.src].
 * 3. The result is that all children of each [.src] node (i.e., [key1] and [key2]) are copied and appended as children to each [.dest] node found at the same level.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Syncing configuration keys from a source node to multiple destination nodes in a batch operation.
 * - Cloning data entries from one collection to several targets for data replication or migration.
 * - Merging a set of key-value pairs into multiple output nodes to prepare uniform structures for further processing.
 * - Populating multiple containers with identical sets of initial values for parallel workflows.
