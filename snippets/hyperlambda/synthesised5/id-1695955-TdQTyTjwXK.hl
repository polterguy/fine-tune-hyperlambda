/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it evaluates the expression to find the first node named [.fields] in the current scope and returns its value.
 * 2. The `x:@.fields` expression uses the `@` iterator to locate the [.fields] node from the current context, ensuring only the first match is selected.
 * 3. The returned value is the raw value of the [.fields] node, regardless of its type or content.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Accessing the value of a formâ€™s [.fields] node to process submitted user data.
 * - Retrieving configuration information stored under a [.fields] node in a workflow.
 * - Using the value of [.fields] as input for further logic or conditional operations in the Hyperlambda execution tree.
