/*
 * 1. The [io.file.list] slot retrieves a list of files from the [/modules/chinook/] directory and adds them as children nodes under the [io.file.list] node.
 * 2. The [for-each] slot iterates through each file node found by [io.file.list], referencing each file node as [.dp] during the iteration.
 * 3. Inside the loop, [if] checks whether the current file node's value ends with ".hl" using [strings.ends-with].
 * 4. If the file name ends with ".hl", [unwrap] is invoked to evaluate all child nodes of the next sibling node of the current file node, and [add] appends a new node to [.result] with the file path as its value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Filtering all Hyperlambda (*.hl) files from a module directory for further processing or listing.
 * - Building a catalog of available endpoints or scripts within the [chinook] module.
 * - Preparing a list of Hyperlambda files to be dynamically loaded, analyzed, or executed in a batch operation.
