/*
 * 1. The [http.get] slot is used to send an HTTP GET request to the specified URL, `"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/2"`, and returns the HTTP response, including headers, status code, and the content. The child node [convert] is set to true, which enables automatic conversion of the response content to a lambda object if the response type is supported (e.g., JSON).
 * 2. The [.post_body] node is created to hold data related to the body of the fetched post.
 * 3. The [set-value] slot assigns a value to the [.post_body] node. The value is obtained by using the [get-value] slot, which extracts the value of the [body] node inside the [content] of the HTTP GET response. The expression `:x:@http.get/*/content/*/body` navigates to the [body] field in the deserialized response.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving and extracting a specific field (the post body) from a remote JSON API using a GET request.
 * - Storing the main content of a blog post or article from a public API for further processing or display.
 * - Automating data fetching workflows where you need to isolate and save only certain parts of an API response, such as the body of a post.
 * - Integrating with third-party REST APIs to synchronize or display external content in a local application.
