/*
 * 1. [execute-file] runs the external Hyperlambda file located at `/modules/users/register.hl`, passing the specified arguments to it.
 * 2. [name] and [age] nodes are provided as input parameters, with [age] explicitly typed as an integer and [name] as a string.
 * 3. The target file can use these arguments to perform actions such as registering a new user, validating the input, or storing data in a database.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Registering a user named Emily Carter, aged 27, via an HTTP API.
 * - Automating user onboarding in a workflow by supplying dynamic values to the registration logic.
 * - Batch processing multiple user registrations by invoking this code with different argument values in succession.
 * - Testing the registration logic in isolation by directly executing the registration Hyperlambda file with sample data.
