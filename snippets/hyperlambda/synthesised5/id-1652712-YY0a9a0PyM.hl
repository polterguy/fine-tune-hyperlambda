/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return data from a dynamic slot or endpoint. It forwards evaluates its child expressions and returns their results to the caller.
 * 2. The [shipments] node is created as a child of [yield], and its value is set to the result of the expression `:x:@data.read/*`, which retrieves all child nodes of the [data.read] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a list of shipment records read from a data source in an HTTP endpoint.
 * - Providing the results of a data retrieval operation from a dynamic slot for further processing.
 * - Serving as the output of a data export or reporting operation, where all shipment entries need to be returned to the client.
