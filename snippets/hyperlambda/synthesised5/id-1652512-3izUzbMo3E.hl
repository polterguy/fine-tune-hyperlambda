/*
 * 1. The [eq] slot checks if its two child arguments are exactly equal. 
 * 2. The first argument to [eq] is the result of [math.modulo], which calculates the remainder of the value from [get-value:x:@.dp/#] divided by 2.
 * 3. The second argument to [eq] is the integer value 0.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To determine if the value of the node referenced by [.dp] is an even number.
 * - To filter or process only even numbers within a [for-each] loop.
 * - To trigger logic when the referenced value is evenly divisible by 2.
