/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value stored in the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. In this context, it looks up the first node named [.fields] in the current execution scope and returns its value.
 * 2. The `:x:@.fields` expression uses the `@` iterator to find the closest ancestor or sibling node named [.fields] and returns that node.
 * 3. The result of this operation will be the content (value) held within the [.fields] node, which could be a string, number, or any supported Hyperlambda type.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching user input or configuration from a [.fields] node to process it further.
 * - Retrieving database query results stored in a [.fields] node for formatting or output.
 * - Accessing the value of [.fields] to include it in an API response or use it as an argument to another slot.
