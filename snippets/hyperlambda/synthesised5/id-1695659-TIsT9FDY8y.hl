/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression in its value argument.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.databaseType` points to a node named [.databaseType] and obtains its value.
 * 3. The result of [get-value] will be the direct value stored in the [.databaseType] node, which can be used by subsequent slots or operations.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Accessing a configuration value for database type to determine which database adapter to use.
 * - Retrieving user-supplied input or parameters for conditional logic elsewhere in the workflow.
 * - Passing the value of [.databaseType] to another slot for further processing, such as selecting a connection method.
