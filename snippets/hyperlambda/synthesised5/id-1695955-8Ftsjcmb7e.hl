/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate multiple string values into a single string. Its child nodes represent individual parts that will be joined together in the resulting string.
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of a specified node. Here, it is used to fetch the values of [.sql] and [.fields], which are then incorporated into the concatenated string.
 * 3. The static string fragments like ":) * 1.0 / length(" and ":) as keyword_density, (" are used to construct a custom SQL expression, likely for calculating keyword density in a SQL query.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Dynamically building SQL fragments for advanced analytics, such as calculating keyword density in a search context.
 * - Generating custom SQL expressions by assembling parts from node values and static content.
 * - Constructing reusable and parameterized SQL statements in automation scripts or endpoint logic.
