/*
 * 1. The [strings.contains] slot checks if the string value provided in its value part ("Hello, world!") contains the substring specified by its child node ("!"). It returns true if the substring exists, otherwise false.
 * 2. The child node [.], with a value of "!", specifies the sequence of characters to search for within the original string.
 * 3. This slot is useful for evaluating whether a certain sequence exists within a larger text without needing to manually loop through characters or implement search logic.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Checking if a user input contains a required special character for validation.
 * - Determining if an email address contains the "@" symbol before further processing.
 * - Searching for specific keywords or punctuation in a block of text for parsing or highlighting purposes.
