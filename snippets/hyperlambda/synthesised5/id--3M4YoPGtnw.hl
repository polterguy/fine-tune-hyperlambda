/*
 * 1. The [.data] node is created with two child nodes, [.foo1] and [.foo2], each initialized with their respective values.
 * 2. The [get-name] slot is invoked with the expression `:x:@.data/*`, which targets all immediate child nodes of [.data]. This returns the names of these nodes ("foo1" and "foo2").
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Retrieve the names of all items in a collection for dynamic processing, logging, or reporting.
 * - Generate a list of keys from a structured data segment to use as identifiers elsewhere in the workflow.
 * - Assist in dynamically building user interfaces based on the available node names in a data container.
 * - Validate that the expected keys exist within a parent node by comparing returned names.
