/*
 * 1. The [mail.smtp.send] slot sends an email using the specified SMTP server configuration and message details.
 * 2. The [server] node defines the SMTP connection settings, including [host], [port], [secure], [username], and [password], which are used to authenticate and connect to the SMTP server.
 * 3. The [message] node contains the email details, including [from] (sender information), [to] (recipient information), [subject] (email subject), and [entity] (MIME type and content of the email).
 * 4. The [from] and [to] nodes use child nodes with [name] and [email] to specify sender and recipient details.
 * 5. The [entity:text/plain] node specifies that the email content is plain text, and the [content] node provides the body of the email.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Sending a notification email from a web application to a user, using explicit SMTP server credentials.
 * - Automating system alerts to administrators with custom sender and recipient information.
 * - Sending transactional emails (like password resets or confirmations) with a plain text body.
