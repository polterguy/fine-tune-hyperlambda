/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot initiates a connection to a PostgreSQL database named [customer_db] using the [pgsql] adapter.
 * 2. The [data.select] slot executes a raw SQL query that selects the [name] and [email] columns from the [customers] table where the [active] column is true, using PostgreSQL syntax.
 * 3. The [for-each] slot iterates through each record returned by [data.select], operating on each customer record individually.
 * 4. The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate the expression and access all descendants of the iterated customer node for further processing.
 * 5. The [mail.smtp.send] slot sends an email to each customer using their [name] and [email] values, with a preset subject and plain text content.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Sending personalized reminder emails to all active customers in a PostgreSQL database.
 * - Automating bulk notifications to users who meet specific criteria (e.g., "active = true").
 * - Integrating database-driven user lists with outbound email campaigns.
 * - Regularly reminding customers to engage with a platform or service by querying the latest active users and emailing them.
