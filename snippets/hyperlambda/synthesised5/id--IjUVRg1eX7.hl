/*
 * 1. The [odbc.connect] slot establishes a connection to a database using the "generic" connection string and the "hr" database.
 * 2. The [odbc.scalar] slot executes a SQL query (`select count(*) from employees`) against the open ODBC connection and retrieves a single scalar value representing the total number of rows in the [employees] table.
 * 3. The [yield] slot creates an [employee-count] node, setting its value to the result returned by [odbc.scalar], effectively outputting the employee count as part of the result.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve the total number of employee records in the HR database for reporting or dashboard purposes.
 * - Validate if the [employees] table contains any data before running additional queries or operations.
 * - Provide quick statistics on company size as part of an API response.
