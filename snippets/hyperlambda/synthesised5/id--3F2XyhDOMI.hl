/*
 * 1. The [while] slot creates a loop that continues executing its child lambda as long as its condition is true.
 * 2. The [lt] slot checks whether the value of [.score] is less than 50, serving as the loop’s exit condition.
 * 3. Inside the loop’s lambda, [log.info] outputs a log message each iteration, indicating that the score is being increased.
 * 4. The [math.increment] slot increases the value of [.score] by 1 on each loop iteration.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Repeatedly increment a counter node until a target value is reached.
 * - Log each step of a process where progress needs to be tracked and reported.
 * - Implement retry logic that attempts an action a certain number of times.
 * - Simulate a score or progress bar increasing over time for demonstration or testing purposes.
