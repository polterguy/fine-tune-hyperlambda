/*
 * 1. The [exists] slot checks whether a node named [offset] exists as a direct child of the [.arguments] node using the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/offset`.
 * 2. If such a child node is found, [exists] returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
 * 3. This is typically used for conditional logic to determine if an optional argument was supplied to an endpoint.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To decide whether to apply pagination if [offset] is present in the request arguments.
 * - To trigger validation or business logic only when [offset] is supplied by the caller.
 * - To dynamically set default values or skip processing if [offset] is not included.
