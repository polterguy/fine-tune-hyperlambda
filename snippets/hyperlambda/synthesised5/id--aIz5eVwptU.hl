/*
 * 1. [auth.ticket.verify] ensures the request is authorized by verifying that the user has root access before proceeding.
 * 2. [io.folder.list-recursively] is used to retrieve a full recursive listing of all folders within the folder specified by the [folder] argument, including hidden folders and, optionally, system folders depending on the value of [sys].
 * 3. [return-nodes] returns all child nodes generated by [io.folder.list-recursively], effectively returning the recursive folder listing as the response.
 * 
 * Possible use cases:
 * - To audit or display the complete directory structure, including hidden and system folders, within a specified path for administrative users.
 * - For backup utilities needing to enumerate all subfolders under a directory, even those that are normally hidden or system folders.
 * - In a file management dashboard restricted to root users, allowing full visibility into directory hierarchies for maintenance or troubleshooting.
 * - To programmatically check the presence and structure of folders during scheduled server health checks or migrations.
