/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates over each child node of [.library], passing the current node by reference into the [.dp] node for each iteration.
 * 2. The [if] slot checks if the [rating] child node of the currently iterated node is greater than 4.8 using the [mt] (more than) slot.
 * 3. If the [rating] is greater than 4.8, the [add] slot adds a [bestseller] node with a value of true to the current node.
 * 4. If the [rating] is not greater than 4.8, the [else] block adds a [bestseller] node with a value of false to the current node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Marking books in a library as bestsellers if their rating exceeds a certain threshold.
 * - Tagging products in a catalog as top-rated based on customer ratings.
 * - Flagging movies in a collection as "must-watch" if their ratings are above a specified value.
