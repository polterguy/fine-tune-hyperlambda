/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot checks if the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/note_id` exists and has a non-null value. If not, it throws an exception, effectively enforcing that [note_id] must be provided as an argument.
 * 2. This slot is typically used for input validation to ensure required fields are present before proceeding with further logic.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that a [note_id] argument is always supplied to an API endpoint that requires it to identify a note.
 * - Validating form submissions where [note_id] is a required field for updating or deleting a note.
 * - Preventing execution of business logic if [note_id] is missing, thus avoiding potential errors or inconsistent state.
