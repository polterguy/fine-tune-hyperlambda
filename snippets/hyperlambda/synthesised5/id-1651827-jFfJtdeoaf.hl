 * 1. The [not] slot inverts the result of its child condition, returning true if the child condition is false, and false if the child condition is true.
 * 2. The [strings.starts-with] slot checks if the value of the [url] node inside [.arguments] starts with the string "http://". It returns true if the [url] value starts with "http://", otherwise false.
 * 3. The [not] slot wraps [strings.starts-with], so the overall result is true if the [url] value does NOT start with "http://".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To validate that a given URL does not use the "http://" scheme, for example to enforce "https://" only URLs.
 * - To prevent users from submitting URLs that start with "http://".
 * - To trigger logic or validation errors if an insecure URL scheme is detected in user input.
