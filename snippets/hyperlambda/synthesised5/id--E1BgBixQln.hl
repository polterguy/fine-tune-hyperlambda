/*
 * 1. The [.or-names] node appears to reference a set of child nodes under [.fields] whose names are either [username] or [email], using the lambda expression `:x:@.fields/*/[username|email]`. This expression filters for all child nodes of [.fields] that have the name [username] or [email].
 * 2. The use of the `[username|email]` pipe-separated syntax allows the expression to match and retrieve multiple possible node names in a single operation, making it flexible for scenarios where either field may be present.
 * 3. The resulting [.or-names] node will contain all nodes from [.fields] that match the specified names, enabling subsequent processing or validation steps to work with either user identification method without hardcoding which one is present.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Selecting user credential fields from a dynamic form where either [username] or [email] may be submitted.
 * - Aggregating alternative contact methods into a single node for further processing.
 * - Filtering a set of profile fields to locate identifiers for authentication or lookup purposes.
 * - Preparing a node collection for validation where multiple possible field names are acceptable for a required input.
