/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to query data from a data source, specifying the table to read from, the columns to return, and the filtering conditions.
 * 2. The [table] node specifies that the query will be performed on the [Course] table.
 * 3. The [columns] node lists the columns to be included in the result set, specifically [CourseId] and [Title].
 * 4. The [where] node is used to define filtering criteria for the query.
 * 5. The [and] node allows for combining multiple conditions, though in this case only one condition is specified.
 * 6. The [ProfessorId.eq] node specifies a filter where the [ProfessorId] column must be equal to the value obtained from the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/ProfessorId`, which dynamically references a [ProfessorId] value from the current execution context.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve all courses taught by a specific professor, where the professor's ID is dynamically determined at runtime.
 * - Display a list of course titles and IDs for a selected professor in an educational management application.
 * - Filter courses in a report or dashboard based on the professor currently being processed in a loop or workflow.
