/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot is used here to delete nodes.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@signal/*/*/db/=sys` targets all descendant nodes named [db] under any child and grandchild of [signal], but only if their value is exactly "sys".
 * 3. All nodes matching this criteria will be removed from the hierarchy, including their child nodes if any.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up configuration trees by removing specific [db] nodes with a value of "sys".
 * - Sanitizing signal data by purging sensitive or deprecated [db] references.
 * - Preprocessing a tree to exclude certain database connections before exporting or further processing.
