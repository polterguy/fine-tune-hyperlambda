/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to append a new child node under the result set(s) returned from the `@data.connect/*/data.select` expression, ensuring the new node is added to each matching node.
 * 2. The new node being added is named [@prefix], and its value is set dynamically using the value from the [prefix-url] node found within the [.arguments] node.
 * 3. The `x:@.arguments/*/prefix-url` expression extracts the value of the [prefix-url] node to use as the value for the newly added [@prefix] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Enhancing each database query result with a prefix URL needed for resource identification in API responses.
 * - Tagging multiple fetched records with a common prefix for subsequent processing or downstream requests.
 * - Dynamically appending metadata to each result row after a [data.select] operation, using request arguments as the source.
