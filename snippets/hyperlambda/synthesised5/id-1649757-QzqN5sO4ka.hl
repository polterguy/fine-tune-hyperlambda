/*
 * 1. The [return] slot is used to immediately exit from the current execution context and return the specified nodes to the caller. In this case, it returns a node named [schedules].
 * 2. The [schedules] node is included as a child of [return], which means the value or structure of [schedules] (possibly set or constructed earlier in the execution) will be the result sent back to the caller.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a list of scheduled tasks or schedules from an endpoint or function.
 * - Serving the current schedules as a response to an HTTP request.
 * - Providing the caller with the result of a query or operation related to task scheduling.
