/*
 * 1. The [not-null] slot checks whether the expression `:x:@.src/*/foo` returns any nodes with a non-null value. In this case, it evaluates whether the [foo] node under [.src] exists and whether its value is not null.
 * 2. The [not-null] slot will return true if at least one node found by the expression has a value assigned (in this case, [foo] has the value "bar").
 * 3. If there are no [foo] nodes or all have null values, [not-null] will return false.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Verifying if a configuration property exists and has been set before proceeding.
 * - Checking for required data presence in an import or API payload.
 * - Validating user input fields to ensure they're not empty or missing.
 * - Ensuring a reference to a resource is actually pointing to something meaningful in a workflow.
