/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node(s) referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it will look for a node named [.fields] in the current context and return its value.
 * 2. The expression `@.fields` specifically targets the first node named [.fields] among the siblings or children, depending on the current position in the node graph.
 * 3. The result of this slot is the raw value stored in the [.fields] node, which could be a string, number, or any other data type stored as the node's value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting a JSON or string payload stored in a [.fields] node for further processing.
 * - Fetching user input or configuration data previously assigned to [.fields].
 * - Using the value of [.fields] as an argument for another slot or for conditional logic elsewhere in the workflow.
 * - Passing along the [.fields] value to an external API or function.
