/*
 * 1. The [strings.ends-with] slot checks if the value of the [.filename] node ends with the string "pdf", determining if the file is a PDF by its extension.
 * 2. The [if] slot evaluates the result of [strings.ends-with]; if true, it executes its [.lambda] child.
 * 3. Inside the [.lambda], [set-value] updates the value of the [.file-type] node to "pdf".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically categorize uploaded files as PDF by extension.
 * - Implement access control logic based on file type.
 * - Prepare file metadata for further processing, e.g., enabling PDF-specific features.
 * - Trigger PDF conversion or extraction workflows only for PDF files.
