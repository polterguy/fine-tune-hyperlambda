/*
 * 1. The [not] slot logically inverts the result of its child condition. In this case, it will return true if the child condition is false, and false if the child condition is true.
 * 2. The [strings.starts-with] slot checks if the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/url` starts with the string "https://". It returns true if the string starts with "https://", otherwise false.
 * 3. The combination of [not] and [strings.starts-with] means this code checks whether the value of the [url] node inside [arguments] does NOT start with "https://".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To validate that a provided URL does not use the "https://" scheme, possibly to enforce use of "http://" or another protocol.
 * - To prevent users from submitting secure URLs in a form where only non-secure URLs are allowed.
 * - As part of a conditional branch to trigger different logic depending on whether a URL is secure or not.
