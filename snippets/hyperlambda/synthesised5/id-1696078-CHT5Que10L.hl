 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of all nodes matching the expression `:x:@.fields` with the result provided by its child node.
 * 2. The [strings.join] slot concatenates the values of all child nodes of [.fields], inserting the separator string " || " between each value.
 * 3. The expression `:x:@.fields/*` references every direct child node of the [.fields] node, collecting their values for the join operation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Combine a list of database field names in [.fields] into a single string separated by " || " for use in SQL concatenation queries.
 * - Transform multiple user input values under [.fields] into a display string with custom delimiters.
 * - Aggregate column labels or tags into a single line for reporting or logging purposes.
 * - Prepare a pipeline of keywords stored under [.fields] for full-text search queries, separated by " || ".
