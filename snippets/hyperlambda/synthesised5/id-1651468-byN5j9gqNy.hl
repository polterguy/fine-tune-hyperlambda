/*
 * 1. The [sort] slot is being invoked with the value [price_asc], which is likely an expression or a reference to a lambda object that defines how the sorting should be performed.
 * 2. The [sort] slot expects an expression leading to a list of nodes to sort, and a lambda object that determines the comparison logic between nodes using [.lhs], [.rhs], and [.result] nodes.
 * 3. In this context, [price_asc] probably refers to a predefined sorting lambda that sorts nodes in ascending order based on their price property.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Sorting a list of product nodes by their price in ascending order before displaying them in a web shop.
 * - Organizing invoice or order items by price for reporting or summary purposes.
 * - Preparing a sorted list of service offerings by cost for user selection interfaces.
