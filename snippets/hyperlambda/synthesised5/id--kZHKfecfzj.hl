/*
 * 1. The [.present] node is created with a single child node named [node].
 * 2. The [exists] slot is used with the expression `:x:@.present/*`, which checks if [.present] has any child nodes.
 * 3. Since [.present] contains the [node] child, [exists] will return true.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Verifying that a required node exists before performing further processing.
 * - Implementing conditional logic that depends on the presence of specific configuration or data nodes.
 * - Validating input structures to ensure expected child nodes are included.
 * - Preventing errors by confirming that necessary nodes are present before accessing their values.
