/*
 * 1. The [get-name] slot retrieves the name of the node specified by its expression.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.data/*/={@.arg1}` searches all children of the [.data] node and filters for the first node whose value matches the value of [.arg1].
 * 3. [.arg1] contains the value "thomas", so the expression will resolve to the [foo2] node under [.data], as its value is also "thomas".
 * 4. [get-name] will therefore return the name "foo2", which is the name of the matched node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Find the key or identifier of a node in a collection by searching for a specific value.
 * - Retrieve the name of a user or item by its unique property, such as username or ID.
 * - Map a value to its associated key in a dataset for further processing or lookup.
 * - Quickly identify which entry in a list matches a dynamic search parameter.
