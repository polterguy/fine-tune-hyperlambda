/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a connection to the "sakila" database, making it the context for subsequent database operations.
 * 2. The [data.select] slot executes a raw SQL query against the connected database, in this case retrieving the "title" and "release_year" columns from the "film" table, limited to 3 records.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Quickly previewing a small sample of movie titles and their release years from the "sakila" database for reporting or UI display.
 * - Testing connectivity and SQL syntax against the "film" table without retrieving excessive data.
 * - Supporting features like dropdowns or previews by fetching a limited list of films.
 * - Validating that the database schema contains expected columns by observing returned data.
