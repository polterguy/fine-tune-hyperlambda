/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression argument. In this case, the expression `:x:@.sql` points to a node named [.sql] within the current context, and [get-value] will return the value stored in that node.
 * 2. The `:x:` prefix indicates that the following string is an expression, not a static value, allowing dynamic referencing of nodes.
 * 3. This slot is often used to extract data from a node so it can be used elsewhere in the workflow, or to pass it as an argument to other slots.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the raw SQL string from a [.sql] node to display it for debugging or logging purposes.
 * - Passing the value of [.sql] as a parameter to another process or slot, such as executing SQL or validating its contents.
 * - Dynamically retrieving user input or generated SQL statements to use in further data processing steps.
