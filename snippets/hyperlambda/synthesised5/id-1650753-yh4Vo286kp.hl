/*
 * 1. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all nodes referenced by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/comments.name.eq`. This expression navigates to all child nodes of [.arguments], then to their [comments] child, then to its [name] child, and finally to any [eq] child nodes.
 * 2. The result is a node set containing all [eq] nodes found at the specified path, which can be used for further processing, validation, or evaluation in subsequent slots.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting all equality conditions defined under comments for validation or analysis.
 * - Aggregating or inspecting all [eq] nodes related to comment names in an HTTP endpoint's arguments.
 * - Preparing a filtered list of nodes for batch processing or reporting.
