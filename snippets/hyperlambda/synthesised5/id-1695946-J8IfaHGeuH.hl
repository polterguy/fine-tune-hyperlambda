/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates multiple string values together. In this case, it is used to build a SQL fragment by combining selected values.
 * 2. The [get-value:x:@.sql] slot retrieves the current value of the [.sql] node, allowing it to be included at the start of the concatenation.
 * 3. The node with the value [.:" order by keyword_count desc, keyword_density desc limit "] adds a static SQL "ORDER BY" and "LIMIT" clause to the concatenated result.
 * 4. The [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/limit] slot extracts the [limit] value from the [.arguments] node, dynamically inserting the limit parameter at the end of the SQL string.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically constructing a SQL query with an ORDER BY and LIMIT clause based on user input.
 * - Generating paginated or sorted search results where the limit is specified by the caller.
 * - Modifying or extending an existing SQL query by appending additional clauses.
 * - Ensuring the final SQL statement includes runtime-configurable constraints for efficient data retrieval.
