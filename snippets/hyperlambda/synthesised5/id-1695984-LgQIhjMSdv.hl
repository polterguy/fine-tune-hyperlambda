/*
 * 1. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple logical conditions, ensuring that all its child conditions must be true for the overall expression to be true.
 * 2. The node [EmployeeTerritories.EmployeeID:EmployeeID.EmployeeID] specifies a join condition, asserting that the [EmployeeTerritories.EmployeeID] column must match the [EmployeeID.EmployeeID] column.
 * 3. This construct is typically used in SQL join operations within Hyperlambda, ensuring accurate row matching between the [EmployeeTerritories] table and the [EmployeeID] table.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Enforcing that only records where the employee IDs match in both tables are included in a SQL join.
 * - Constructing a composite join condition by adding more child nodes under [and].
 * - Integrating this condition within a larger [join] or [where] clause to refine data selection.
 * - Ensuring referential integrity when retrieving related data from multiple tables using Hyperlambda.
