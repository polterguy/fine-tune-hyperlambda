/*
 * 1. The [response.headers.set] slot is used to set HTTP response headers for the outgoing response, allowing customization of how the client interprets the returned data.
 * 2. The [Content-Type] header is explicitly set to "application/pdf", indicating that the response will be a PDF file.
 * 3. The [Content-Disposition] header is set using the result of an expression `:x:@strings.concat`, which likely dynamically generates the value (for example, to specify an attachment filename).
 * 4. The [Access-Control-Expose-Headers] header is set to "Content-Disposition", making this header accessible to browsers in CORS scenarios.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a dynamically generated PDF file to a client and prompting a download with a specific filename.
 * - Allowing JavaScript running in browsers to read the Content-Disposition header after a cross-origin PDF download.
 * - Serving PDF documents from an API endpoint with custom headers for file handling and CORS support.
