/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to query records from a database table.
 * 2. The [table] node specifies the target table as [Shipment].
 * 3. The [columns] node lists the columns to be returned: [ShipmentId] and [DispatchDate].
 * 4. The [where] node adds a filter condition, using [and] to combine one or more criteria.
 * 5. The [WarehouseId.eq] node under [and] creates a condition where the [WarehouseId] column must be equal to a value.
 * 6. The value for [WarehouseId.eq] is dynamically retrieved using the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/WarehouseId`, which references the [WarehouseId] value from a node passed in by reference (commonly within a [for-each] loop or similar context).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve all shipments from the [Shipment] table that are associated with a specific warehouse, where the warehouse ID is dynamically provided at runtime.
 * - Use within a batch process to fetch shipment records for multiple warehouses by iterating over warehouse IDs and executing this query for each one.
 * - Filter shipments for reporting or display purposes, showing only those dispatched from a particular warehouse.
