/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to add a new node structure to the node set referenced by the expression `:x:@json2lambda/*/magic/*/auth`. This means it inserts the following node hierarchy as a child under the [auth] node found in the parsed JSON-to-lambda structure.
 * 2. Inside the added node, a [recaptcha] node is created, which itself contains two child nodes: [key] and [secret]. The values of [key] and [secret] are dynamically set from the values of [.arguments/*/key] and [.arguments/*/secret], respectively, using expressions.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically inject reCAPTCHA configuration (key and secret) into an authentication configuration tree parsed from JSON.
 * - Extend an existing authentication lambda structure with reCAPTCHA credentials provided as arguments, for use in further validation or setup.
 * - Prepare a lambda object for downstream slots or endpoints that require reCAPTCHA credentials as part of the authentication process.
