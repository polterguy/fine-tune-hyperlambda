 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve configuration or input data stored in a [.fields] node for further processing.
 * - Use as part of a conditional check, such as comparing the value of [.fields] to a specific value.
 * - Pass the value of [.fields] as an argument to another slot or function.
 * - Display or return the value of [.fields] in an API response.
