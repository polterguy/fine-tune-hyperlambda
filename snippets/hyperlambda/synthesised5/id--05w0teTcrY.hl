/*
 * 1. The [strings.replace] slot performs a string replacement operation on the value of the [.phrase] node, replacing all occurrences of the substring specified by the value of [.target] with the value of [.replacement].
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the string values from both [.target] and [.replacement] nodes, which are then used as the search and replacement strings, respectively, in the [strings.replace] operation.
 * 3. The main expression `:x:@.phrase` ensures that the replacement operation is performed on the value found in [.phrase], not on raw or hardcoded strings, allowing dynamic string manipulation based on current node values.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically update specific words or phrases in a text node, such as correcting typos or standardizing terms.
 * - Personalize messages by replacing placeholders with user-specific values (e.g., replacing "{name}" with an actual name).
 * - Enable localized or context-sensitive text transformations by referencing different [.target] and [.replacement] nodes.
