/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot checks whether the node(s) referenced by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/max` exist and have a value. If any referenced node is missing or has a null value, an exception is thrown.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/max` targets all [max] nodes that are children of any child node of [.arguments], allowing validation of multiple [max] arguments at once.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that a required [max] parameter is provided in the input to an HTTP endpoint.
 * - Validating that all nested [max] arguments in a complex data structure are present before further processing.
 * - Preventing execution of business logic if any expected [max] argument is missing from the request.
