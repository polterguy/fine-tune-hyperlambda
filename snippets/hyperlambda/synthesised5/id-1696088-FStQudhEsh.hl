/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node(s) referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. The `@.fields` expression finds the first node named [.fields] in the current hierarchy, and [get-value] returns its value.
 * 2. If there are multiple [.fields] nodes, only the first one encountered will be used due to the `@` iterator.
 * 3. The result of this operation is the direct value content of the [.fields] node, which could be a string, number, or any value assigned to it.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the content of a specific field from a data structure after processing user input.
 * - Retrieving a configuration value stored under [.fields] for use in further slot operations.
 * - Accessing a default or computed value from [.fields] to pass as an argument to another slot.
