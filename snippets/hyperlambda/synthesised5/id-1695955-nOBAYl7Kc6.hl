/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it looks for the first node named [.fields] in the current context and returns its value.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.fields` uses the @ iterator to search for the first ancestor or sibling node named [.fields] relative to the current node.
 * 3. The result of this operation will be the actual value stored within the [.fields] node, which could be a string, number, or any other supported Hyperlambda type.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting form field values from a [.fields] node in a web request handler.
 * - Accessing configuration or metadata stored in a [.fields] node elsewhere in a larger Hyperlambda graph.
 * - Passing the value of [.fields] as an argument to another slot for further processing or validation.
