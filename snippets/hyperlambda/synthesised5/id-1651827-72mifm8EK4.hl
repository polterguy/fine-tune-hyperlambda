 * 1. The [not] slot inverts the boolean result of its child condition, so it will return true if the child condition is false, and vice versa.
 * 2. The [strings.starts-with] slot checks if the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/url` starts with the string "https://". It returns true if it does, false otherwise.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To validate that a URL does not start with "https://" (for example, to enforce only "http://" or other schemes).
 * - As part of an [if] condition to trigger logic when a URL does not use HTTPS.
 * - To display a warning or error if a user submits a URL that is not secure (does not begin with "https://").
