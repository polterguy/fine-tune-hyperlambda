/*
 * 1. The [.log] node acts as a container, with a child node [info] holding the value "Generated programmatically".
 * 2. The [lambda2hyper] slot is invoked with the expression `:x:-/*`, which targets all child nodes of the current node (in this case, the [info] node under [.log]).
 * 3. [lambda2hyper] serializes the targeted lambda nodes into a Hyperlambda string representation, effectively converting the in-memory node structure to a textual Hyperlambda format.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Exporting log entries as Hyperlambda code to persist activity logs in a text file.
 * - Transferring structured logging data between systems using Hyperlambda as the interchange format.
 * - Visualizing or inspecting programmatically generated node hierarchies by converting them into readable Hyperlambda text.
