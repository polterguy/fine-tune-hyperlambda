/*
 * 1. The [.foo] node is assigned the string value "some input string".
 * 2. The [strings.split] slot is called with an expression pointing to the previous node (the value of [.foo]) as input.
 * 3. The child node of [strings.split] provides the delimiter, which is a single space character (" ").
 * 4. As a result, [strings.split] splits the input string into separate nodes for each word, removing the delimiter from the output.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Breaking a sentence from [.foo] into individual words for further processing.
 * - Parsing a CSV or space-separated string to handle each element individually.
 * - Tokenizing input data for validation or transformation.
 * - Separating user input into components for command or argument parsing.
