/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. In this case, it searches for the first node named [.fields] in the current context and returns its value.
 * 2. The expression `@.fields` ensures that only the first matching [.fields] node is found, even if there are multiple nodes with that name at different locations within the execution tree.
 * 3. This slot is often used when you have a data container node, such as [.fields], holding a value you want to read and use in further processing or logic.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the user-submitted data stored in a [.fields] node for validation or transformation.
 * - Retrieving configuration values from a [.fields] node inside an endpoint before executing business logic.
 * - Accessing the result of a previous computation or lookup, which has been stored in [.fields] earlier in the execution flow.
 * - Passing the value of [.fields] as an argument to another slot or endpoint invocation.
