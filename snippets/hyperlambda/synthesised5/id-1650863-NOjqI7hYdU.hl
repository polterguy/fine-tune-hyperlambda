/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node(s) referenced by its expression.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@http.post/*/content/*/name` navigates to the first [http.post] node, then to its [content] child, then to all children of [content], and finally to their [name] child nodes.
 * 3. The result is the value(s) of all [name] nodes found within the [content] children of the [http.post] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the name fields from the response content of an HTTP POST request.
 * - Retrieving a list of item names after submitting data to an API and receiving a structured response.
 * - Accessing specific data fields from a nested API response for further processing or display.
