/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used here to append nodes to the [.words] node. It takes as input the result of the [strings.split] operation.
 * 2. [strings.split] splits the value of [query] (which is a child node of [.arguments]) at every space character, producing a set of string fragments as nodes.
 * 3. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/query` retrieves the [query] node from within [.arguments], ensuring the correct string is targeted for splitting.
 * 4. The result of [strings.split] (i.e., each word from the query string) is added as a child node under [.words].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Tokenizing a user input string from [query] into individual words for subsequent processing or searching.
 * - Building a list of search keywords from a user's query for a full-text search feature.
 * - Preparing a set of tags from a space-separated input to use elsewhere in the application.
