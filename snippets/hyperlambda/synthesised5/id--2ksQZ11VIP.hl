/*
 * 1. [if]: Checks if the value of [.input] is not equal to "Go Go Go" using the [neq] slot. If this condition is true, the code within the [.lambda] block is executed.
 * 2. [neq]: Compares the value found at [.input] with the string "Go Go Go" and returns true if they are not the same.
 * 3. [log.info]: Writes a log message indicating whether [.input] matches "Go Go Go" or not.
 * 4. [else]: If the [if] condition is false (meaning [.input] is equal to "Go Go Go"), the code inside [else] is executed, logging the positive match.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating user input to differentiate between a specific command ("Go Go Go") and any other string.
 * - Logging events conditionally based on whether a value matches an expected string or not.
 * - Auditing or debugging flows where the exact content of a node like [.input] determines which messages or actions are triggered.
