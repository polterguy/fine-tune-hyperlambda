/*
 * 1. The [http.post] slot is used to send a POST request to "https://billing.example.com/api/v1/invoices" with a payload containing [customer_id], [amount], and [currency], and the [convert] argument set to true for automatic response conversion.
 * 2. The [if] slot checks if the HTTP response status code is greater than or equal to 200 ([mte]) and less than 300 ([lt]), using [and] to ensure both conditions are met (i.e., the request was successful).
 * 3. Inside the conditional lambda, [set-value] updates the [.invoice.status] node to indicate that the invoice was created successfully.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically updating [.invoice.status] after creating an invoice through an external billing API.
 * - Handling API responses and reflecting success or failure in internal workflow nodes.
 * - Validating HTTP response codes and conditionally executing business logic only when the API call succeeds.
 * - Integrating third-party billing or payment services and storing the operation result in a workflow.
