/*
 * 1. [auth.ticket.verify] is used to ensure that the current user has an employee-level authentication ticket before proceeding, enforcing access control on the operation.
 * 2. [validators.mandatory] checks that the [.arguments] node contains a value for [InvoiceLineId], preventing execution if this critical parameter is missing.
 * 3. [data.connect] establishes a connection to the database, targeting either a "generic" database or the "chinook" database, and specifies that the database type is SQLite.
 * 4. [add] dynamically inserts all argument nodes from [.arguments] as children under the [and] node inside the [where] clause of [data.delete], allowing for flexible construction of deletion criteria based on input parameters.
 * 5. [data.delete] performs the delete operation on the [InvoiceLine] table in the SQLite database, using the conditions dynamically built in the [where] clause.
 * 6. [unwrap] ensures that the result nodes from the previous operation are fully evaluated and available in the current context.
 * 7. [return] outputs the number of affected rows from the [data.delete] operation, making the result accessible to the caller.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Deleting a specific invoice line in an accounting or billing application based on its unique identifier.
 * - Securely removing invoice details by an authenticated employee, ensuring unauthorized users cannot perform deletions.
 * - Implementing a REST API endpoint for deleting invoice line items, where the operation is parameterized and validated for safety.
 * - Building dynamic delete operations in a low-code environment, where deletion criteria are determined at runtime from request arguments.
