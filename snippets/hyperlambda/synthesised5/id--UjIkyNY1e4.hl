/*
 * 1. The [insert-before] slot is used to insert a new node as a sibling before the [step1] node, based on the expression `:x:@.process/*/step1`.
 * 2. The inserted node is an unnamed container (.) with a single child named [init], whose value is "Initialization step".
 * 3. The effect is that inside [.process], the [init] node appears before [step1], altering the sequence of steps in the process flow.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Adding a preparatory step before an existing workflow step without modifying the original structure.
 * - Dynamically inserting validation or setup routines before main logic in a process graph.
 * - Ensuring initialization actions always precede a specific step when building modular process pipelines.
