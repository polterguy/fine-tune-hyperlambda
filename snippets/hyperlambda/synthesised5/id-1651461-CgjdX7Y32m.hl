/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.ip_address] node to a new value.
 * 2. The new value is retrieved using the [get-value] slot, which extracts the value from the [origin] node located within the [content] node, which is itself a child of the result of a [http.get] invocation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the client's public IP address from an HTTP GET response (such as from an IP echo service) and storing it in the [.ip_address] node.
 * - Updating a local variable with a value parsed from an external API response.
 * - Synchronizing a node's value with dynamic data fetched from an HTTP request.
