/*
 * 1. The [return] slot is used to immediately end the execution of the current Hyperlambda file or endpoint and send a response back to the client.
 * 2. The [result] node is created as a child of [return] and contains the string value "Hello from Magic Backend". This node will be included in the response payload sent to the HTTP client.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To create a simple test endpoint that verifies your backend is running and reachable.
 * - As a basic example for learning how to structure Hyperlambda API responses.
 * - For returning static informational messages from an HTTP endpoint, such as a health check or welcome message.
 * - As a template for creating more complex endpoints that will eventually return dynamic data.
