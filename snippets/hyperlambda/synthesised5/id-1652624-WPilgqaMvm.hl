/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to add nodes to a destination in the lambda object. The expression `:x:+/*/*` specifies that the nodes will be added as children to all grandchildren of the next sibling node at the same level as the current node.
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all nodes referenced by the expression `:x:@http.get/*/content/*`, which means it selects all child nodes of the [content] node that is a child of any node under [http.get].
 * 3. The result of [get-nodes] is used as the source nodes to be added by [add], effectively copying all nodes under [content] from the [http.get] result into the specified destination in the lambda graph.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To merge or copy HTTP response content nodes into another part of the lambda object for further processing.
 * - To dynamically aggregate data fetched from an HTTP request into an existing data structure.
 * - To transform or enrich the lambda graph with external data before additional operations or output.
