/*
 * 1. The [type] slot returns the Hyperlambda type name of the value referenced by its expression argument. In this case, it is given the static value "string" as an argument.
 * 2. When executed as shown, [type] will output the type name of the value "string", which is simply "string". This demonstrates how to retrieve the type information for a value or node in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Verifying the type of a value before performing type-sensitive operations.
 * - Debugging or logging the type of a node's value for dynamic workflows.
 * - Ensuring that input data matches expected types in validation routines.
