/*
 * 1. The [.bigNumber] node is created with a type of long (signed 64-bit integer) and assigned the value 9007199254740992.
 * 2. The explicit type declaration ensures that any subsequent operations recognize the value as a 64-bit integer, avoiding unintended type conversions or overflows.
 * 3. By storing such a large number, this node can be used in scenarios requiring precise calculations or comparisons with very large integer values.
 * 4. This value exceeds the maximum safe integer in JavaScript, so using a 64-bit type in Hyperlambda prevents precision loss that would occur in JavaScript environments.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Storing high-precision numerical IDs or counters that exceed standard 32-bit integer limits.
 * - Performing arithmetic, formatting, or conversion on large numbers without loss of accuracy.
 * - Comparing or serializing large numeric values for financial, scientific, or cryptographic applications.
 * - Testing boundary conditions related to large integer values in business logic.
