/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to read data from a data source, specifying the [table] as [Course].
 * 2. The [columns] node lists [CourseId] and [Title], indicating that only these columns will be included in the result set.
 * 3. The [where] node contains an [and] condition, which allows for multiple filter criteria to be combined using logical AND.
 * 4. The [ProfessorId.eq] node specifies a filter condition where the [ProfessorId] column must be equal to the value obtained from the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/ProfessorId`. This expression references the [ProfessorId] value from a node passed in by reference, typically used within a loop or dynamic context.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving a list of courses (with their IDs and titles) taught by a specific professor, where the professor's ID is dynamically provided.
 * - Filtering courses for display in a user interface based on the currently selected professor.
 * - Generating a report of courses associated with a particular professor in an educational management system.
