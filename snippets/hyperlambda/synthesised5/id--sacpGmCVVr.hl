/*
 * 1. The [strings.regex-replace] slot is used to perform a case-insensitive search for the substring "yes" within the value of the [.input] node and replace all matches with the string "no".
 * 2. The regular expression `(?i)yes` enables case-insensitive matching, so it will find "yes", "YES", or any capitalization of "yes".
 * 3. The resulting value after execution will have every occurrence of "yes" (regardless of case) replaced by "no".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Normalizing user input to replace all variations of a specific word with a standard term.
 * - Cleaning up data by replacing certain keywords in a case-insensitive way.
 * - Implementing find-and-replace features where the search should not be affected by text casing.
