/*
 * 1. The [data.delete] slot is used to delete records from a database table.  
 * 2. The [table] node specifies the name of the table to delete records from, in this case [ml_requests].  
 * 3. The [where] node is used to define the conditions that must be met for records to be deleted.  
 * 4. The [and] node under [where] allows you to specify multiple conditions that must all be true for a record to be deleted. In this code, no specific conditions are listed yet, so you would add child nodes under [and] to define which records to delete.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Deleting all records from the [ml_requests] table that match certain criteria, such as a specific user ID or status.
 * - Removing outdated or processed machine learning requests from the [ml_requests] table based on a timestamp condition.
 * - Cleaning up test or invalid entries from the [ml_requests] table by specifying multiple conditions under [and].
