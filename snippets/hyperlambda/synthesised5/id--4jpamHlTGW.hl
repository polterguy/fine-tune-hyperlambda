/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a connection to the database specified by [DATABASE_NAME], preparing for further database operations.
 * 2. The [database-type] node under [data.connect] and [data.delete] explicitly sets the database type to SQLite, ensuring all operations target an SQLite database.
 * 3. The [data.delete] slot is used to delete records from a table, and its [table] node specifies the target table ([TABLE_NAME]) for deletion.
 * 4. The [where] clause, with its nested [and] node, sets the condition for deletion such that only records with [id] equal to the value obtained from the expression `:x:@WHATEVER_ID_HERE` will be deleted.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Removing a user record by their ID from a users table in a local SQLite database.
 * - Deleting a specific product entry in a product inventory table where the product ID matches a provided value.
 * - Cleaning up obsolete log entries from a logs table by passing in the log entry's ID.
 * - Implementing an API endpoint to delete a contact from a CRM system based on the contact's unique identifier.
