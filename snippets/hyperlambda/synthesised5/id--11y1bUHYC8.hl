/*
 * 1. The [.errors] node is used to store different error messages as its child nodes, with each child node representing a specific error code and its associated message.
 * 2. The [for-each] slot iterates over all child nodes of [.errors] by evaluating the expression `:x:@.errors/*`, which yields each error node under [.errors].
 * 3. For each iterated error node, the [log.info] slot is invoked with the value of the currently iterated node passed by reference through [.dp/#], which logs each error message individually.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Logging a predefined list of error messages for diagnostic or monitoring purposes.
 * - Auditing all possible error scenarios at application startup to ensure error handling is correctly configured.
 * - Testing the logging system by simulating the logging of various standard error codes and messages.
 * - Quickly outputting all known errors to a log for verification or debugging.
