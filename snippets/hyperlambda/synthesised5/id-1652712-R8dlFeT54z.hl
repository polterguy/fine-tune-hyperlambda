/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot initiates a database read operation.
 * 2. The [table] node specifies that the query targets the [Shipment] table.
 * 3. The [columns] node lists [ShipmentId] and [DispatchDate] as the columns to be returned in the result set.
 * 4. The [where] node defines a filter condition for the query.
 * 5. The [and] node allows for one or more conditions to be combined with logical AND.
 * 6. The [WarehouseId.eq] node creates a condition where the [WarehouseId] column must be equal to the value resolved by the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/WarehouseId`, which dynamically references the [WarehouseId] value from another part of the execution context.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve all shipments from the [Shipment] table that are associated with a specific warehouse, where the warehouse ID is determined dynamically at runtime.
 * - Display a list of shipment IDs and their dispatch dates for a selected warehouse in a dashboard or report.
 * - Filter shipments based on the warehouse context provided by user input or another process step.
