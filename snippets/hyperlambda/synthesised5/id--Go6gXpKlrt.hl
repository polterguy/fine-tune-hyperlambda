/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates over all child nodes of every [.foo1] node found among the parent's children, executing its child lambda for each.
 * 2. For each such child node, the code unconditionally adds a [foo2] node as a child within the [for-each] context (i.e., to the currently iterated node).
 * 3. This construct uses the relative expression `../*/.foo1/*` to target all children of all [.foo1] nodes at the same scope as the original [.foo1].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Add a [foo2] node to every child of every [.foo1] node in a parent node set.
 * - Automatically extend the structure under [.foo1] nodes as part of a data transformation or upgrade.
 * - Prepare multiple nodes for further processing by ensuring each child of [.foo1] has a [foo2] entry.
