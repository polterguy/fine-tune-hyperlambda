/*
 * 1. The [data.delete] slot is used to delete records from a database table.  
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies the type of database being used, in this case, SQLite.  
 * 3. The [table] node indicates the target table for deletion, which is [Order Details].  
 * 4. The [where] node, combined with [and], is used to define one or more conditions that must be met for records to be deleted. In this snippet, the [and] node is present but does not yet contain any specific conditions, so no records would be deleted unless conditions are added as child nodes.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Deleting specific records from the [Order Details] table in a SQLite database based on one or more conditions (to be defined under [and]).
 * - Removing all records that match a set of criteria, such as orders from a particular customer or within a certain date range, by adding appropriate conditions under [and].
 * - Implementing a cleanup operation to delete obsolete or invalid order details from the database.
