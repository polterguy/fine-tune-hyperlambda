/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to broadcast a SignalR event named "crm.tasks.put" to connected clients.
 * 2. The [roles] node specifies that only users with the "admin" or "root" roles will receive the signal.
 * 3. The [args] node is included as a placeholder for any arguments that should be sent to the subscribers as a JSON payload, but in this example it is empty.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Notifying all administrators and root users in real-time when a task is updated in a CRM system.
 * - Broadcasting system-wide task changes to privileged users only.
 * - Triggering client-side updates for admin dashboards whenever tasks are modified.
