/*
 * 1. The [.data] node is assigned the string value "Hyperlambda rocks", which serves as the input data to be hashed.
 * 2. The [crypto.hash.sha1] slot generates a SHA-1 hash of the value referenced by the expression `:x:@.data`, i.e., the content of the [.data] node.
 * 3. The [format] child node with the value "raw" specifies that the resulting hash should be returned in its raw binary format instead of as a text or fingerprint representation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Storing or comparing raw binary hash values for data integrity checks within a Hyperlambda workflow.
 * - Interfacing with systems or APIs that expect hashes in raw byte format rather than hexadecimal strings.
 * - Implementing legacy authentication or verification mechanisms that require SHA-1 hashes for backward compatibility.
