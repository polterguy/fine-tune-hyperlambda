/*
 * 1. The [mt] slot compares two values and returns true if the first argument is greater than the second.
 * 2. The first argument to [mt] is the result of [math.subtract], which calculates the difference between the current date and time (from [date.now]) and a birth date value retrieved from [@data.read/*/*/birth_date].
 * 3. The second argument to [mt] is the result of [math.multiply], which multiplies a time span of 365 days (created by [time] with [days:365]) by 18, effectively producing a time span representing 18 years.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Checking if a person is at least 18 years old by comparing their birth date to the current date.
 * - Validating age requirements for registration, access control, or legal compliance.
 * - Enforcing minimum age restrictions in forms or workflows that require users to be over a certain age.
