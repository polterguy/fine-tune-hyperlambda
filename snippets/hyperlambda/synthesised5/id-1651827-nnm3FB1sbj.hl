/*
 * 1. The [strings.starts-with] slot checks if the value of the [url] node inside the [.arguments] node begins with the string "https://".
 * 2. The `:x:@.arguments/*/url` expression retrieves the [url] node from the [.arguments] node, typically used to access an argument passed to an HTTP endpoint.
 * 3. The child node with value "https://" specifies the prefix that the [url] value must start with for the slot to return true.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating that a user-provided URL argument uses the HTTPS protocol before processing it further.
 * - Ensuring API endpoints or redirect URLs start with "https://" for security compliance.
 * - Pre-filtering URLs to enforce secure links in a web application.
