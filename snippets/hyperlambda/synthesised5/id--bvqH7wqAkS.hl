/*
 * 1. The [insert-before] slot is used to insert new nodes directly before the node(s) referenced by its main expression argument. In this case, it targets the [chapter1] node within the [.book] node.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.book/*/chapter1` finds the [chapter1] node that is a child of [.book], ensuring the new node is inserted right before it.
 * 3. The child node of [insert-before] contains a single unnamed node, which itself contains [chapter0] with the value "Introduction chapter". This structure is required to wrap the inserted content properly.
 * 4. As a result, after execution, the [.book] node will have [chapter0] (with its introduction value) as its first child, immediately followed by [chapter1].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Prepending an introduction or foreword before the first chapter in a dynamically generated book structure.
 * - Inserting a new step before an existing step in a list of instructions or workflow nodes.
 * - Adding meta-data nodes before primary data nodes in a configuration or document outline.
 * - Organizing items by inserting new headings or sections before existing content in a document hierarchy.
