/*
 * 1. The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate the expression `:x:./*/signal/*/.onafter/*/.feedback-channel` and return the resulting nodes or values.
 * 2. The expression navigates from the current node up one level to its parent (`.`), then retrieves all its children (`*`), finds the [signal] node among those children, gets all children of [signal], finds the [.onafter] node, retrieves all its children, and finally selects the [.feedback-channel] node(s) among those children.
 * 3. The result is the value(s) or node(s) of [.feedback-channel] nodes found within the [.onafter] section of a [signal] node that is a sibling to the current node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To extract the feedback channel information after a signal has been processed, for logging or further processing.
 * - To dynamically retrieve communication or callback channel details for asynchronous operations after a signal event.
 * - To collect feedback or status updates from a signal's post-processing logic in a workflow.
