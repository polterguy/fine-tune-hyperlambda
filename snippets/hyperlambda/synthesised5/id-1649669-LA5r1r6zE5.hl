/*
 * 1. The [throw] slot is used to immediately raise an exception with the message "401 Unauthorized – Invalid or missing token". This will halt further execution and return an error to the client.
 * 2. The [case] node is likely part of a [switch] or similar branching construct, and matches when an integer value of 401 (commonly representing HTTP Unauthorized) is encountered.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To handle HTTP 401 Unauthorized errors by returning a clear error message when a JWT token is invalid or missing.
 * - To provide standardized error handling in API endpoints that require authentication.
 * - To ensure clients receive an explicit response when authentication fails, aiding in debugging and user feedback.
