 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it evaluates the expression to find the node named [.fields] and returns its value.
 * 2. The returned value can be used as input for other slots, assigned to another node, or outputted as a result.
 * 3. If [.fields] does not exist or has a null value, the result will be null.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching user-submitted form fields for further processing.
 * - Retrieving configuration or settings stored in a [.fields] node.
 * - Accessing a collection of database field names or values for validation or transformation.
