/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.sql] node, using the result of a concatenation operation.
 * 2. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates multiple string values to form a single string. In this case, it combines the current value of the [.sql] node with the static string ") as keyword_count".
 * 3. The [get-value] slot retrieves the current value of the [.sql] node, which is then used as the first part of the concatenation.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Appending a SQL alias (e.g., "as keyword_count") to an existing SQL statement stored in [.sql].
 * - Dynamically building complex SQL queries by incrementally adding segments to the [.sql] node.
 * - Renaming a computed column in a SQL query result by finalizing the column definition with an alias.
 * - Ensuring the updated SQL statement is stored back in the same [.sql] node for further processing or execution.
