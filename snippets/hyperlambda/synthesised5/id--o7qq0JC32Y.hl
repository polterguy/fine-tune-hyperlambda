/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates over each child node of [.members], assigning each member node by reference to [.dp].
 * 2. Inside the loop, [unwrap] is called with `:x:+/*/*`, resolving to the children of the next sibling node at the root level, and evaluates them.
 * 3. The [add] slot then appends a new child node to the currently iterated member (referenced by [.dp]), with a child [team] node whose value is taken from [.team].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Enriching each member node in [.members] with a [team] attribute sourced from a separate [.team] node.
 * - Dynamically assigning team information to user profiles in a user management workflow.
 * - Populating organization-related metadata to nodes during ETL or data transformation processes.
 * - Tagging or grouping nodes in a dataset by referencing shared contextual information elsewhere in the graph.
