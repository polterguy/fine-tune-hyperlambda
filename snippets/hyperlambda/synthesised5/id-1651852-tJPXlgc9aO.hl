/*
 * 1. The [strings.ends-with] slot checks if the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.dp/#` ends with the string "css".
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.dp/#` retrieves the value of the node referenced by [.dp], which is typically used inside a loop or include context to refer to the currently iterated node.
 * 3. The slot returns true if the value ends with "css", and false otherwise.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Determining if a filename or path has a ".css" extension during file processing.
 * - Filtering a list of file names to find all CSS files.
 * - Applying specific logic or configuration only to nodes whose values end with "css".
