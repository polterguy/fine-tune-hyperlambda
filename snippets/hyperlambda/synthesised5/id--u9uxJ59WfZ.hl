/*
 * 1. The [image.chart:grouped] slot generates a grouped bar chart image with the specified parameters.
 * 2. The [filename] node sets the output file path for the chart image.
 * 3. The [width] and [height] nodes define the dimensions of the generated chart.
 * 4. The [bars] node organizes the bar data by categories (Spring, Summer, Autumn), each containing a list of integer values representing data points for each group in the legend.
 * 5. The [legend] node provides labels for each group of bars, aligning the legend entries ("Phones," "Computers," "Tablets") to the corresponding values within each season.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Visualizing seasonal sales data for different product categories.
 * - Creating automated reports that include grouped bar charts for performance comparison.
 * - Generating visual analytics for export or embedding in a dashboard.
 * - Comparing the distribution of multiple variables (e.g., device types) across distinct periods.
