/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot is used to retrieve the value of a specific node.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.sql` points to a node named [.sql] that is expected to exist in the current context.
 * 3. When executed, [get-value] will resolve the expression and return the value stored in the [.sql] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Accessing the generated SQL string after a [sql.*] slot has produced it in a [.sql] node.
 * - Fetching a database query or command stored in [.sql] for logging or debugging.
 * - Passing the value of [.sql] as an argument to another slot or function.
 * - Displaying the generated SQL to a user for review before execution.
 * - Using the retrieved SQL value in further conditional logic or processing.
