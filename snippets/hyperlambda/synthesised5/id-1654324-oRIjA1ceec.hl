/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node(s) referenced by its expression.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/CustomerId` navigates to the [.dp] node, dereferences its value as a node (using `#`), selects all child nodes (`*`), and then filters for nodes named [CustomerId].
 * 3. The result is the value of the [CustomerId] node(s) that are children of the node referenced by the value of [.dp].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the customer ID from a data structure where [.dp] is a reference to a parent node containing customer information.
 * - Accessing nested values when iterating over a collection with [for-each], where [.dp] is the current item.
 * - Fetching specific identifiers from complex node hierarchies for further processing or validation.
