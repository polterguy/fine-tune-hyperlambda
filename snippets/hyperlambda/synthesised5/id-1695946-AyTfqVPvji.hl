/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot deletes all nodes matched by its expression argument.
 * 2. The expression `@data.select/*/*/keyword_density` targets every [keyword_density] node that is a child of any node, which is itself a child of any node under [data.select].
 * 3. When executed, every [keyword_density] node nested two levels below [data.select] will be permanently removed from the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up temporary [keyword_density] nodes from the output of a data selection operation before further processing.
 * - Removing calculated keyword density metrics from result sets prior to exporting or logging to avoid sensitive or unnecessary information leakage.
 * - Streamlining the structure of [data.select] results for display purposes by omitting [keyword_density] details.
 * - Preprocessing input data by deleting all [keyword_density] nodes before running new analysis steps.
