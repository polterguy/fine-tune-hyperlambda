/*
 * 1. The [http.get] slot initiates an HTTP GET request to the URL "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos".
 * 2. The [headers] node is used to explicitly define request headers for the HTTP call.
 * 3. Within [headers], the Accept header is set to "application/json", instructing the server that the client expects a JSON response.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Retrieve a list of todos in JSON format from a REST API endpoint.
 * - Demonstrate how to override default request headers to specify the desired response type.
 * - Integrate external data from a public API into a Hyperlambda-based workflow, ensuring correct content negotiation for parsing the response.
