/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to append new child nodes to each node referenced by the `@.result` expression.
 * 2. The first child node of [add] is a container (with name [.]) which contains a node structure to be added.
 * 3. Inside this container, a node is created with the name [name] whose value is set dynamically to the value of the currently referenced node via `x:@.dp/#`.
 * 4. The [tables] node is also added as a sibling to [name] within the same container node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating a list of result items where each item gets its name from a dynamic source and includes a [tables] node placeholder for further population.
 * - Building a report structure where each result entry must reference a specific item and hold related table data.
 * - Generating a hierarchical data structure where each parent node under [.result] is enriched with metadata and associated tables.
