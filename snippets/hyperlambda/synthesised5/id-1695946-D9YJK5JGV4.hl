/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@.sql`.
 * 2. The expression `@.sql` finds the first node named [.sql] in the current context.
 * 3. The result is the value contained within the [.sql] node, which can then be used in subsequent operations or returned as output.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the generated SQL string from a previously constructed [.sql] node for logging or debugging purposes.
 * - Passing the value of [.sql] to another slot that requires a raw SQL statement as input.
 * - Displaying the SQL command to the user in a UI for transparency or review before execution.
 * - Using the SQL value as input to a slot that will execute it against a database.
