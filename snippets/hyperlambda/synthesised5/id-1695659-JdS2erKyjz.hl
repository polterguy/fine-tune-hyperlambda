/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot is used twice to delete specific nodes from the structure.  
 * 2. The first [remove-nodes] removes all nodes under [@signal/*/*/db] whose value is "template1".  
 * 3. The second [remove-nodes] removes all nodes under [@signal/*/*/db] whose value is "template0".
 * 
 * Use cases:  
 * - Cleaning out default PostgreSQL database references ([template1] and [template0]) from a node structure to avoid operating on system databases.  
 * - Preprocessing a signal tree to ensure only user databases remain before performing further database operations.  
 * - Filtering out unwanted nodes from a dynamically generated tree before passing it to another processing step.  
 * - Enforcing business rules that forbid actions on internal PostgreSQL templates in automation scripts.  
 * - Sanitizing configuration data before deployment or migration tasks.
