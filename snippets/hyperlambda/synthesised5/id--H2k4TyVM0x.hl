/*
 * 1. The [image.crop] slot is used to crop an image based on specified pixel values from each side.
 * 2. The [file] node specifies the input image file to be cropped, in this case [file] is set to "/input.jpg".
 * 3. The [top] and [bottom] nodes determine how many pixels will be removed from the top and bottom edges of the image, with [top] cropping 100 pixels from the top and [bottom] cropping 50 pixels from the bottom.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Removing unwanted header and footer regions from a scanned document image.
 * - Cropping out branding or watermark areas from the top and bottom of a photograph.
 * - Preparing a user-uploaded image by trimming extra space from the edges before further processing.
