/*
 * 1. The [strings.regex-replace] slot takes a source string as its value and replaces all matches of the regular expression provided in its first child node with the replacement string from its second child node.
 * 2. In this example, the regular expression [.fo+] targets occurrences of "fo" with one or more "o" characters, and all such matches in "foo bar hansen" are replaced with "FOO".
 * 3. The result of this operation is the string "FOO bar hansen", with "foo" replaced by "FOO".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Sanitizing user input by replacing specific patterns (such as repeated characters) with a normalized form.
 * - Masking or obfuscating sensitive data in strings, like replacing account numbers matching a pattern.
 * - Refactoring text to update old naming conventions by replacing deprecated patterns with new ones.
 * - Cleaning up log messages by removing or substituting complex sequences that match a regex.
