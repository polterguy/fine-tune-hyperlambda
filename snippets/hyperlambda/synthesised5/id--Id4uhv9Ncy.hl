/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks a condition provided by its first child and executes a block if the condition is true.
 * 2. The [or] slot evaluates its children, returning true if at least one of the provided arguments is true, using short-circuit logic.
 * 3. [get-value] fetches the value of [.a] and [.b] to be tested as part of the [or] logical operation.
 * 4. If the [or] slot evaluates to true, the [.lambda] block is executed, which contains [set-value] to update the value of [.decision] to "Passed via OR".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Deciding whether to proceed with an action if at least one of multiple conditions is satisfied.
 * - Implementing fallback logic where multiple flags or checks can independently trigger a response.
 * - Evaluating user permissions or feature flags where more than one can grant access.
 * - Short-circuiting a validation process as soon as one positive condition is found.
