/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot targets the node named [.sql] and updates its value based on the result of its child expression.
 * 2. [strings.concat] concatenates a sequence of string values, which in this case are: the current value of [.sql], the string " from ", the string "notes", and the string " where keyword_count > 0".
 * 3. [get-value] retrieves the current value of the [.sql] node to be used as the first part of the concatenated string.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Building complex SQL queries incrementally by appending additional clauses to an existing SQL statement stored in [.sql].
 * - Dynamically constructing a SELECT statement by specifying the table and a WHERE condition only if certain criteria are met.
 * - Updating a SQL command string in-place each time new query components need to be added, enabling flexible and programmatic query generation.
 * - Useful in scenarios where you want to reuse or modify an existing SQL fragment rather than constructing the entire statement from scratch each time.
