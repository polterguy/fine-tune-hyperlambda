/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.sql] node with the result of the concatenation.
 * 2. [strings.concat] combines the current value of [.sql], the static SQL fragment " order by keyword_count desc, keyword_density desc limit ", and a value retrieved from [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/limit].
 * 3. [get-value] is used to fetch the existing value from [.sql] and the [limit] argument provided under [.arguments].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Appending an ORDER BY and LIMIT clause to a dynamically constructed SQL statement.
 * - Building SQL queries with customizable sorting and record limits based on user input.
 * - Modifying existing SQL strings to support result ordering by keyword metrics in a reporting or analytics module.
 * - Generating paginated query results where the page size is determined at runtime.
