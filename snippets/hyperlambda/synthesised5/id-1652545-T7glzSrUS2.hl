/*
 * 1. [data.connect] establishes a connection to the database named "chinook".
 * 2. [data.read] selects up to 10 records from the [Artist] table in the connected database.
 * 3. [for-each] iterates through each record returned by [data.read], making each record available as a reference node [.dp].
 * 4. [add] appends each iterated artist record to the [.artists] node, using [get-nodes] to retrieve the content of the current [.dp] node by reference.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve and aggregate the first 10 artists from the "chinook" database into a single [.artists] node for further processing.
 * - Prepare a collection of artist records for transformation or export.
 * - Batch process or display a limited set of artist data from a larger database table.
