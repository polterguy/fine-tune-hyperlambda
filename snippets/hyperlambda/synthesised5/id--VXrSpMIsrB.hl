/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates through all child nodes of [user1] under the [.users] node, assigning each node to the [.dp] reference node for use within the loop body.
 * 2. [get-name] retrieves the name of the current node referenced by [.dp], effectively obtaining the property name from [user1] (such as "name", "role", or "active").
 * 3. [set-value] updates the value of the corresponding property node under [user2] within [.users], using the same property name as from [user1], and sets its value to the value from the corresponding node in [user1] by invoking [get-value] on [.dp].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Synchronizing or copying all properties and their values from one user (e.g., [user1]) to another user ([user2]) where the property structure is the same.
 * - Resetting or updating template user data for new users by mirroring the profile fields from an admin or default account.
 * - Ensuring that multiple user nodes maintain consistent values for shared properties by propagating changes from a reference user.
 * - Bulk updating fields across similar nodes without explicitly specifying each property, allowing for dynamic property propagation.
