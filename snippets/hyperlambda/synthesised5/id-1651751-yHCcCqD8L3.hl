/*
 * 1. The [eq] slot compares two arguments and returns true if their values are exactly the same.
 * 2. The first argument uses [get-value] with the expression `:x:@crypto.password.hash`, which retrieves the value of the [crypto.password.hash] node.
 * 3. The second argument is a node named [.] with no value, representing an empty string or null value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To check if the result of [crypto.password.hash] is empty or null, possibly indicating a hashing failure.
 * - As a validation step to ensure a password hash was successfully generated before proceeding.
 * - To trigger an error or alternative logic if no hash value is present after attempting to hash a password.
