/*
 * 1. The [exists] slot checks if its provided expression yields one or more nodes. Here, the expression `:x:-/*` retrieves all children of the previous sibling node.
 * 2. The previous sibling node for [exists] is [.dest], so `:x:-/*` gets all children of [.dest], which is the [sub] node.
 * 3. Since [.dest] has a [sub] child, [exists] will return true, indicating that at least one child node exists.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To verify if a node has any children before performing further operations.
 * - As a condition within an [if] statement to branch logic depending on node existence.
 * - When validating the structure of a Hyperlambda document to ensure required elements are present.
