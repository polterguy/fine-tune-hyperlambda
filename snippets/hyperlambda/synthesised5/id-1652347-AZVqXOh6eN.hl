/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a connection to a database named "hospital" using the generic adapter, with the database type explicitly set to SQLite by the [database-type] node.
 * 2. The [add] slot dynamically adds all nodes from [.arguments] as children to the [and] node inside the [where] clause of [data.read]. This allows for flexible, runtime construction of filtering conditions based on incoming arguments.
 * 3. The [data.read] slot performs a SQL SELECT operation on the [Doctors] table, selecting a single column [count(*)] and giving it the alias [count], with a [where] clause that will be populated by the previous [add] operation. The [limit] is set to 1, ensuring only one result is returned.
 * 4. The [return-nodes] slot returns all child nodes of the [data.read] result, effectively returning the count value to the caller.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Counting the number of doctors in the [Doctors] table that match dynamic filter criteria provided at runtime (such as department, specialty, or status).
 * - Building an API endpoint that returns the total number of doctors matching certain search parameters.
 * - Integrating with a dashboard widget that displays the count of doctors based on user-selected filters.
