/*
 * 1. The [eq] slot compares the value of all [.foo1] sibling nodes to the string "OK" and returns true if they are equal.
 * 2. The [not] slot inverts the result of the [eq] comparison, effectively checking if any sibling [.foo1] node does not have the value "OK".
 * 3. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of each sibling [.foo1] node for the comparison.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Detecting when a status node such as [.foo1] deviates from an expected value ("OK").
 * - Triggering error handling logic if not all sibling nodes signal success.
 * - Implementing conditional flows that should only run when a value is different from the nominal state.
 * - Validating input or configuration data to ensure it matches required criteria.
