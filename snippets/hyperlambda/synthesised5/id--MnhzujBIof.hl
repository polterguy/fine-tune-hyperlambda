/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node defines two expected input arguments: [name] of type string and [age] of type int.
 * 2. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates the value of [name], the string " is ", the value of [age], and the string " years old." to form a complete sentence.
 * 3. The [return] slot returns a node named [message] whose value is set to the result of the [strings.concat] operation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Generating a personalized message displaying a user's name and age in a readable sentence.
 * - Formatting user profile information for display in a UI.
 * - Creating confirmation messages after a user submits their name and age in a form.
 * - Providing user-friendly output for API responses that involve basic personal data.
