/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks if its first argument is true. If so, it executes its [.lambda] child node.
 * 2. Inside the first [.lambda], there is another [if] slot (nested) that checks if its first argument is true (in this case, it's false).
 * 3. If the nested [if] condition were true, it would run its [.lambda], which sets the value of the [.result] node to "Nested condition met" using [set-value].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating logic where an action should only occur if multiple levels of conditions are met.
 * - Implementing early exit or "guard" logic inside a workflow.
 * - Structuring nested decision trees for business rules or validation checks.
 * - Ensuring actions only execute when a parent and a child condition hold simultaneously.
