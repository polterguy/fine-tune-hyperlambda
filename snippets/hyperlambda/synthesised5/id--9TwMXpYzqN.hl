/*
 * 1. The [math.subtract] slot is used to subtract the value of [.b] from [.a], effectively calculating 10 - 4, resulting in 6.
 * 2. The [math.divide] slot then takes the result of the subtraction (6) and divides it by the static integer value 2, resulting in 3.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Calculate the average difference between two values by first subtracting and then dividing.
 * - Useful for determining how many times a particular difference fits into another value.
 * - Can be used in algorithms where intermediate mathematical results need to be chained using the results of previous operations.
