/*
 * 1. The [strings.regex-replace] slot is used to replace all occurrences in the value of [.source] that match the regular expression pattern specified by [.pattern] with the string value found in [.replacement].
 * 2. [get-value] is used twice to dynamically retrieve the values of [.pattern] and [.replacement] so that the regex pattern and replacement string are passed to [strings.regex-replace] as arguments.
 * 3. The expression `:x:@.source` ensures that the input string for the replacement operation is taken from the [.source] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Masking or redacting all digits in a user ID or sensitive information by replacing them with a placeholder character.
 * - Formatting strings by finding and replacing specific patterns (e.g., all numbers) in text data.
 * - Sanitizing input data where certain patterns (such as numbers or special characters) must be replaced before further processing.
 * - Preparing strings for display by substituting matched substrings according to custom rules.
