/*
 * 1. The [strings.join] slot concatenates the values of all nodes selected by the expression `:x:@.fields/*`, inserting the string " || " as a separator between each value.
 * 2. The argument `:x:@.fields/*` targets all child nodes of the [.fields] node, and each of their values will be joined in order.
 * 3. The child node with value " || " specifies the separator string that is placed between each joined value, so the result is a single string with all field values separated by " || ".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating a single output string from multiple field values with a custom delimiter, e.g., for SQL SELECT statements or CSV-like outputs.
 * - Presenting a user interface that displays selected fields in a readable, separated format.
 * - Generating log entries where multiple pieces of data are combined and separated by a recognizable string.
 * - Formatting lists of values for export or display, where a custom separator is required.
