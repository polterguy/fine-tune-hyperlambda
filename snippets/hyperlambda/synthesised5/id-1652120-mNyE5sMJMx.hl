 * 1. The [not] slot inverts the boolean result of its child slot, returning true if the child evaluates to false, and vice versa.
 * 2. The [strings.end-with] slot checks if the value of the [name] node inside the [file] node within [.arguments] ends with ".csv".
 * 3. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/file/*/name` navigates to the [name] node under the [file] node within [.arguments].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To validate that an uploaded file does not have a ".csv" extension.
 * - As a condition to trigger alternative logic if the file is not a CSV file.
 * - To prevent processing of non-CSV files in an endpoint that expects other file types.
