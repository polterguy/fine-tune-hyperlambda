/*
 * 1. The [add] slot appends a new child node to the referenced node set, which here is determined by a deeply nested expression: `:x:@for-each/@for-each/@for-each/@.dp/#/*/tables/0/-/*/foreign_keys`.
 * 2. The path navigates through multiple [for-each] iterations, dereferences the current [.dp] node, traverses through the [tables] node, selects the first table ([0]), moves to its previous sibling (using [-]), accesses its children ([*]), and finally targets the [foreign_keys] node(s).
 * 3. The [add] slot then adds a new anonymous node, with two additional levels of anonymous children, as descendants of the [foreign_keys] node(s).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically attaching placeholder objects or nested structures to [foreign_keys] nodes during iterative tree processing.
 * - Preparing the data model to receive future information about foreign key relationships for sibling tables during a complex data import or transformation.
 * - Structuring deeply nested results when building a database schema representation, making room for future metadata or configuration data under [foreign_keys].
 * - Supporting recursive operations on related table structures by programmatically expanding the node tree at specific points.
