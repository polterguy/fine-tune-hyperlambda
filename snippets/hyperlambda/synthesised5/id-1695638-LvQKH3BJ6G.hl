/*
 * 1. The [and] slot performs a logical AND operation on all its children, returning true only if every condition is true.
 * 2. The [exists] slot checks if there is at least one node named [prefix-url] under [.arguments], confirming the presence of this node.
 * 3. The [not-null] slot ensures that at least one [prefix-url] node under [.arguments] has a non-null value, verifying the node is not empty.
 * 4. The [neq] slot compares the value of [prefix-url] to an empty string, making sure the value is not blank.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating that a required URL argument is present, not null, and not an empty string before proceeding with further logic.
 * - Ensuring user input for [prefix-url] is meaningful before saving or processing it.
 * - Asserting preconditions in an API endpoint where [prefix-url] must be provided and populated.
 * - Checking form submission fields to avoid processing incomplete or empty data.
