/*
 * 1. The [math.increment] slot is used to increase the value of the [.counter] node by 1. It takes an expression `:x:@.counter` pointing to the [.counter] node and mutates its value in place, so after execution, the value of [.counter] will be 6.
 * 2. No additional arguments are provided to [math.increment], so the default increment step is 1.
 * 3. This operation modifies the original node directly rather than returning a new value, so any subsequent reference to [.counter] in the execution tree will see the incremented value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Tracking the number of times an event occurs by incrementing [.counter] each time the event is processed.
 * - Implementing a loop counter that increases with each iteration.
 * - Maintaining a running tally or unique identifier in workflows that need sequential numbering.
