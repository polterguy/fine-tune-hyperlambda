/*
 * 1. The [not-exists] slot checks if the expression `:x:@data.select/*` returns zero results. If no child nodes exist under [data.select], it evaluates to true; otherwise, it returns false.
 * 2. This logic is useful for determining whether a specific data query or operation returned any records by checking if [data.select] has children.
 * 3. It enables conditional branching based on the absence of query results, allowing you to trigger alternative logic if the data set is empty.
 * 
 * Example use cases:
 * - Displaying a "No records found" message if a SQL SELECT statement returned no rows.
 * - Performing fallback logic when expected data is missing from a result set.
 * - Validating that a filtering operation removed all nodes before proceeding.
