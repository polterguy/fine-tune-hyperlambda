/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates through each child node of the node returned by the `@sqlite.select` expression. For each iteration, the currently iterated node is passed by reference into a [.dp] node.
 * 2. The [unwrap] slot is used to forward-evaluate all grandchild nodes of the currently iterated node, ensuring any expressions or dynamic values are resolved before further processing.
 * 3. The [add] slot inserts a new node into the [columns] node, which is located by navigating from the current context using the expression `../*/return-nodes/0/-/*/columns`. The value of the new node is set to the [name] child node of the currently iterated node, accessed via the [.dp] reference.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically extract and collect column names from the result set of a SQLite query, and add them to a [columns] node for further processing or output.
 * - Transform a set of database schema or query result nodes into a flat list of column names for use in data export or reporting.
 * - Prepare a list of column headers for dynamically generated tables or grids in a UI, based on the structure of a database query result.
