/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to sum values. Here, it takes as its value the expression `:x:./*/http.post/*/payload`, which targets all [payload] nodes that are children of any [http.post] node, which themselves are children of the current node's children.
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node(s) referenced by the expression `:x:@.payload/*`, which gets all children of the current [payload] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Aggregating numeric values from multiple [payload] nodes under different [http.post] requests and calculating their total sum.
 * - Summing up amounts or quantities sent in the payloads of several HTTP POST requests in a batch operation.
 * - Collecting and totaling specific fields from multipart/form-data or JSON payloads across multiple HTTP POST requests for reporting or validation purposes.
