/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates over each child node of [data.read], and for each node, it executes its children with the currently iterated node passed in as a [.dp] node by reference.
 * 2. The [add] slot, inside the loop, appends the currently iterated node (referenced by [get-nodes:x:@.dp/#]) to the [artists] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Aggregating all nodes from [data.read] into a single [artists] collection for further processing or output.
 * - Duplicating or moving nodes from one part of the graph ([data.read]) to another ([artists]).
 * - Building a unified list of items from multiple sources for reporting or transformation.
