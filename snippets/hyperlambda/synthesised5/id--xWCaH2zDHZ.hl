/*
 * 1. The [foo] node is a simple node declaration without a value or child nodes. It acts as a placeholder or marker within the Hyperlambda execution tree.
 * 2. This node can be referenced by expressions or used as a parent for additional nodes that may be added later during runtime.
 * 3. Without a value or children, [foo] currently holds no data and performs no processing by itself.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Used as a target node to store data dynamically with [set-value] in subsequent operations.
 * - Serves as a marker or flag to indicate a particular state or checkpoint in the execution flow.
 * - Can be used as a parent node to organize related child nodes for grouping data or logic branches.
