 * 1. The [if] slot checks a condition and executes its child lambda if the condition is true.
 * 2. The [not] slot negates the result of its child condition, effectively making the condition true if the folder does not exist.
 * 3. The [io.folder.exists] slot checks if the folder at [/etc/hub/image-cache/] exists.
 * 4. If the folder does not exist, the [.lambda] executes its child nodes.
 * 5. The [io.folder.create] slot creates the folder [/etc/hub/image-cache/] if it wasn't found.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring an image cache directory exists before saving or loading cached images.
 * - Automatically creating a storage folder during application initialization if missing.
 * - Preparing a workspace directory for file operations that require a specific folder structure.
 * - Setting up persistent directories before processing user uploads.
 * - Preventing errors by proactively managing missing folders in automated scripts.
