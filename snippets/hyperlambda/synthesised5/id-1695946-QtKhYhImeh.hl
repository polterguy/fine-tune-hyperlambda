/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.sql] node with the result from its child expression.
 * 2. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates the current value of the [.sql] node with the string ") as keyword_count".
 * 3. [get-value] retrieves the existing value from the [.sql] node to be used in the concatenation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Appending an SQL alias to a query string under construction, such as renaming the result of an aggregate function to "keyword_count".
 * - Dynamically building an SQL query by extending the value of [.sql] during different stages of query generation.
 * - Ensuring that the SQL string stored in [.sql] includes a correctly formatted alias for use in subsequent database operations.
 * - Integrating this snippet into a larger routine that composes and executes custom SQL statements with dynamic column naming.
