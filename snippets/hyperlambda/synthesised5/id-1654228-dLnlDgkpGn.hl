/*
 * 1. The [data.update] slot is used to update records in a database table.  
 * 2. The [table] node specifies the target table for the update operation, in this case [users].  
 * 3. The [values] node is where the columns and their new values to be updated should be defined as child nodes.  
 * 4. The [where] node is used to specify the condition(s) that determine which records will be updated, preventing all records from being modified unintentionally.  
 * 5. The [and] node under [where] allows you to combine multiple conditions, so that only records matching all specified criteria will be updated.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Updating a user's email address where the user's ID matches a specific value.
 * - Changing the status of multiple users who meet certain criteria, such as having a specific role and being active.
 * - Bulk updating user profile information for users who registered before a certain date.
