 * 1. The [return] slot is used to immediately exit the current execution context and return a result to the caller.
 * 2. The [result] node is set with a comment string indicating that SQLite does not support the "drop database" SQL syntax. This serves as an informative message to the caller or client.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To inform API consumers that a requested operation (such as dropping a database) is not supported by SQLite.
 * - To provide a standardized response in endpoints or slots where unsupported SQL features are requested.
 * - To gracefully handle unsupported SQL commands by returning a descriptive message instead of raising an error.
