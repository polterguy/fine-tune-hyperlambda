/*
 * 1. The [throw] slot raises an exception with the message "Whatever error message here", immediately terminating further execution unless caught by a [.catch] block.
 * 2. The [status] child node sets the HTTP status code to 398, which will be included in the response if the exception is not caught.
 * 3. The [public] child node set to true ensures that the error details are returned to the client, even in release builds, provided the exception is not handled by a [.catch] block.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Signaling a specific validation error to clients, including custom HTTP status codes for better API error handling.
 * - Returning clear error messages to API consumers when an operation cannot continue, such as missing required data.
 * - Allowing front-end applications to identify and handle errors with custom status codes and messages for enhanced UX.
