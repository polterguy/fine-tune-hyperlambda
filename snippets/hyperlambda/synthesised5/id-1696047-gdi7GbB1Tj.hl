/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to perform a database read operation, specifying the target database type as SQLite via the [database-type] node.
 * 2. The [table] node selects the [campaigns] table as the source for the query.
 * 3. The [columns] node defines a result column using an aggregate functor (such as COUNT, SUM, etc.), and assigns the alias [result] to this computed column using the [as] child node.
 * 4. The [where] node is present with an [and] child, indicating that conditions can be added for filtering results, though no actual conditions are specified in this snippet.
 * 5. The [group] node groups the results by the [group_column] field, enabling aggregation per distinct value of [group_column].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve the count or sum of records in the [campaigns] table, grouped by a specific column such as campaign type or status.
 * - Generate statistical summaries (e.g., total donations per campaign) by specifying the appropriate aggregate function in [aggregate_functor].
 * - Prepare data for reporting dashboards where grouped aggregates are needed (like number of active vs. inactive campaigns).
 * - Filter and group campaign data by adding more conditions under [where] for more refined queries.
