/*
 * 1. The [sqlite.connect] slot establishes a connection to the database specified by the "hospital" connection string, making it possible to execute further database operations within its child nodes.
 * 2. The [sqlite.create] slot constructs an SQL INSERT statement to add a new record to the [patients] table. It uses the [values] node to specify the column data for the new record.
 * 3. Inside [values], three fields are set: [patient_id] with an integer value of 11223, [name] with the value "Robert Brown", and [diagnosis] with the value "Cold". These are mapped to SQL parameters to prevent SQL injection.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Registering a new patient in the hospital database by providing their unique ID, name, and diagnosis.
 * - Automating patient intake processes, where new patient information is inserted into the system upon admission.
 * - Supporting integration with external systems that need to add patient records to the hospital's SQLite database.
 * - Logging test data for development or QA by quickly populating the [patients] table with sample records.
