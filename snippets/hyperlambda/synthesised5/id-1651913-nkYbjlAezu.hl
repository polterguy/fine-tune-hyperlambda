/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to add new nodes as children to the nodes referenced by the expression `:x:../*/return-nodes/0/-/*/columns`. This expression navigates up one level, selects all children, finds nodes named [return-nodes], selects the first one, goes to its previous sibling, then selects all its children, and finally finds nodes named [columns].
 * 2. The child node of [add] is a value node whose value is the result of the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/name`. This retrieves the [name] child node of the node currently referenced by [.dp], which is typically used inside a [for-each] loop to refer to the current item.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically add column names to a [columns] node for each item in a collection during iteration.
 * - Build a list of column names for a data table by extracting the [name] property from each data item.
 * - Aggregate specific child node values from multiple nodes and add them as new children to a target [columns] node.
