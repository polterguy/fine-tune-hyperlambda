/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression in its value argument.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@http.post/*/content/*/user-id` navigates to the first [http.post] node, then to its [content] child, then to any of its children, and finally to a [user-id] node, returning the value of [user-id].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the user ID from the response of an HTTP POST request after submitting data to an API.
 * - Accessing nested data in a complex response structure for further processing or validation.
 * - Retrieving specific user-related information from a lambda object after an external service call.
