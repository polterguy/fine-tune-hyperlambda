/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to append nodes to a target node. In this case, it takes an expression `:x:@data.connect/*/data.select` that selects all [data.select] nodes under any child of [data.connect].
 * 2. For each selected node, [add] executes its lambda block, which contains a single node with a value expression `:x:@.dp/#`. This retrieves the current node being iterated (from [.dp]) by reference and adds it to the destination.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Aggregating multiple [data.select] result sets under a single node for unified processing.
 * - Dynamically merging query results from several database connections into a consolidated structure.
 * - Building a report by collecting data from multiple data sources and appending them into one output node.
 * - Reorganizing or restructuring database query results for further manipulation or export.
