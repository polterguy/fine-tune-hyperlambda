/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot is invoked with the expression `:x:@.sql`, which points to the children nodes of [.sql]. This slot concatenates the values of all these nodes into a single string.
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [.sql] node, which is included as part of the concatenation.
 * 3. The static string node [.:) as keyword_count] appends the text ") as keyword_count" to the end of the concatenated string.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically build a SQL aggregate function, such as "count(keyword)", and alias the result as "keyword_count" in a query.
 * - Compose SQL fragments from multiple sources and finalize them with an alias for use in reporting or analytics.
 * - Automate the creation of complex SQL expressions by combining node values with static suffixes for code generation or migration tools.
 * - Create reusable logic to append standard SQL aliases to dynamically constructed expressions in Hyperlambda workflows.
