/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot deletes all nodes that match the expression provided in its value argument. In this case, the expression `@data.select/*/*/keyword_count` identifies all nodes named [keyword_count] that are children of any node, which in turn are children of any node under [data.select]. 
 * 2. The node path uses two levels of wildcards (`*/*`), so it will target [keyword_count] nodes nested two levels below [data.select], regardless of their parent node names.
 * 3. After execution, all matching [keyword_count] nodes will be removed from the structure, but other sibling or parent nodes remain unaffected.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up temporary [keyword_count] nodes from query results to simplify the resulting data structure.
 * - Removing sensitive or unwanted aggregate fields before returning data to a client.
 * - Preprocessing nested data to normalize structures for further processing or export.
