/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot deletes nodes from the graph.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.fields/*` targets all child nodes of the [fields] node.
 * 3. Executing this will permanently remove every direct child node underneath [fields], leaving [fields] empty.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Clearing all field definitions in a data structure before recreating them.
 * - Resetting dynamic form fields to start with a clean slate.
 * - Removing temporary or calculated nodes after processing is complete.
 * - Preparing a section of the graph for fresh data import.
