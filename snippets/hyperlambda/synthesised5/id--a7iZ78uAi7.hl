/*
 * 1. [date.from-unix] is used to convert a Unix timestamp value (the value of [.timestamp]) into a typed date object in UTC format.
 * 2. The argument to [date.from-unix] is passed via an expression (`:x:@.timestamp`), which retrieves the value from the [.timestamp] node.
 * 3. The [.timestamp] node explicitly declares its value as an integer.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Converting Unix timestamps stored in a database to a readable date format for logging or reporting.
 * - Accepting user input as Unix time and translating it to a .NET DateTime object for further calculations.
 * - Normalizing event records with Unix time for downstream date-based filtering.
 * - Preparing timestamps for formatting with [date.format] for display purposes.
