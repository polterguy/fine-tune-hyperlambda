/*
 * 1. The [.result] node is used to store the final output of the database query.
 * 2. The [data.connect] slot establishes a connection to the [auth_db] database, explicitly specifying the PostgreSQL database type via [database-type:pgsql].
 * 3. The [data.select] slot executes a raw SQL query to fetch the [user_id], [username], and [email] from the [user_accounts] table for users where [active] is true, limiting the results to 50 records. The database type is again specified as PostgreSQL.
 * 4. The [add] slot is used to append the selected user records to the [.result] node.
 * 5. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all result nodes from the executed [data.select] query for aggregation into the final output.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieve a list of up to 50 active user accounts with basic details for an admin panel or dashboard.
 * - Export a subset of active users' data for reporting or batch processing.
 * - Display a paginated list of active users in a web application's user management section.
 * - Prepare data for further filtering or transformation in subsequent workflow steps.
