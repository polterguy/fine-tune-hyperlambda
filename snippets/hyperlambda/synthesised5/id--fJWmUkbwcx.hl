/*
 * 1. The [eq] slot compares its two child arguments for equality and returns true only if both are exactly the same.
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [.src] node using the expression `:x:@.src`.
 * 3. The comparison is made between the current value of [.src] and the integer value 5.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Checking if an input value is equal to a required constant before proceeding with further logic.
 * - Validating user-provided data against a preset value.
 * - Branching workflow execution only if a particular node holds a specific value, such as controlling access based on a numeric code.
 * - Implementing conditional logic in endpoints where a particular field must match exactly.
