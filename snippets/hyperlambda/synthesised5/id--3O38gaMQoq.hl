/*
 * 1. The [image.crop] slot is used to crop an image, and in this case, it targets the image located at [file] with the value "/input.jpg".
 * 2. The [left] and [right] nodes specify how many pixels to remove from the left and right sides of the image, respectively, with [left] removing 30 pixels and [right] removing 70 pixels.
 * 3. No [top] or [bottom] nodes are given, so the image will not be cropped vertically.
 * 4. The cropping operation will output the modified image, either as a stream or saved to a file, depending on further arguments not shown here.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Removing unwanted borders from the sides of a scanned photo.
 * - Adjusting the composition of an uploaded image by trimming content from the left and right edges.
 * - Preprocessing images for machine learning by standardizing the visible content width.
 * - Cropping out a watermark or logo from the edge of an image before sharing.
