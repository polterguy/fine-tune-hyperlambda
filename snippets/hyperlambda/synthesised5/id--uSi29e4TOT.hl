/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node declares an input argument named [foo] of type boolean, which is expected to be provided when this logic is executed.
 * 2. The [if] slot, using the shorthand expression form `:x:@.arguments/*/foo`, checks if the [foo] argument is true.
 * 3. If the condition is true, the [set-value] slot assigns the value "yup!" to the [.dest] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Conditionally update a result node based on an incoming boolean flag.
 * - Implement simple authorization or feature toggling driven by an input parameter.
 * - Trigger follow-up operations only when a specific external condition is true (e.g., user consent).
 * - Validate input and immediately set output status reflecting the truthiness of the input.
