/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node targeted by the expression provided in its value. In this case, the expression `:x:@.sql` locates the first node named [.sql] in the current context and returns its value.
 * 2. The result of [get-value] will be whatever value is stored in the [.sql] node, which could be a string, number, or any other data type supported by Hyperlambda.
 * 3. This slot is typically used when you need to extract dynamic or computed values from previously defined nodes for further processing or conditional logic.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the raw SQL statement stored in a [.sql] node to display or use in subsequent database operations.
 * - Passing the content of [.sql] as an argument to another slot or function that requires a SQL query string.
 * - Logging or debugging the current SQL being executed in a workflow by retrieving its value for inspection.
