/*
 * 1. The [sql.delete] slot is used to construct and execute a SQL DELETE statement targeting the table specified in the [table] node.
 * 2. The [where] node specifies the condition(s) that must be met for records to be deleted, preventing unintended deletion of all records.
 * 3. The [and] node allows combining multiple criteria; both conditions under it must be true for a row to be deleted.
 * 4. The [field1.eq] and [field2.eq] nodes define equality comparisons against the columns "field1" and "field2", ensuring only rows where both columns match the provided values are affected.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Deleting a user from a table only if both their username and email match known values.
 * - Removing a specific order from an orders table where both order ID and customer ID match.
 * - Cleaning up test data in a table by applying precise criteria to avoid deleting unrelated records.
 * - Enforcing business rules where deletion should only occur if multiple field values are confirmed.
