/*
 * 1. The [mssql.connect] slot establishes a connection to the "orders" database or connection string, setting the context for subsequent SQL operations.
 * 2. The [mssql.scalar] slot executes the provided SQL statement (`select avg(total) from orders`), which calculates the average value of the [total] column in the [orders] table, returning a single scalar result.
 * 3. The [yield] slot returns the result of the [mssql.scalar] operation, setting the value of the [average-order-value] node to the retrieved average.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Quickly obtain the average order value from an e-commerce system for reporting or dashboard purposes.
 * - Integrate the result into business logic, such as alerting if the average order drops below a certain threshold.
 * - Provide summary statistics for analytics tools consuming the endpoint.
 * - Automate periodic calculations that require aggregate values from the [orders] table.
