/*
 * 1. The [get-nodes] slot is used to retrieve all nodes referenced by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/values/*`. This expression starts from the [.arguments] node, selects all its children, then for each child, selects their [values] child node, and finally retrieves all children of each [values] node.
 * 2. The result of this slot will be a collection of nodes that are direct children of every [values] node found under each child of [.arguments].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting all value nodes from a structured input where each argument has a [values] node containing multiple entries.
 * - Aggregating or processing a list of items provided as children of [values] nodes in an HTTP endpoint's arguments.
 * - Validating or transforming all values submitted in a batch operation, where each batch item is represented as a child of [values].
