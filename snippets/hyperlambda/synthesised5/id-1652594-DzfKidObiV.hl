/*
 * 1. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple logical conditions, and will only evaluate to true if all its child conditions are true.
 * 2. The [DepartmentId.eq] node is a comparison operator that checks if the value of the [DepartmentId] field is equal to the value obtained from the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/DepartmentId`. This expression likely references the [DepartmentId] value from a specific node in the current context, such as a data row or parameter.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Filtering records in a SQL [where] clause to only include those where [DepartmentId] matches a specific value from another node.
 * - Validating that a given [DepartmentId] is equal to a required value before performing an operation.
 * - Combining this condition with other logical checks inside an [and] block to enforce multiple constraints simultaneously.
