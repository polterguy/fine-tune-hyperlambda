 * 1. The [if] slot checks a condition and executes its [.lambda] child if the condition is true.
 * 2. The [not] slot negates the result of its child condition.
 * 3. The [strings.end-with] slot checks if the value of the [name] node inside the [file] node of [.arguments] ends with ".csv".
 * 4. If the file name does not end with ".csv", the [.lambda] block is executed, which throws an exception with the message "I can only deal with CSV files" using the [throw] slot.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating that an uploaded or provided file is a CSV before processing it.
 * - Preventing non-CSV files from being handled by a CSV-specific workflow.
 * - Providing clear error messages to users who attempt to upload unsupported file types.
