 * 1. The [io.file.list] slot lists all files inside the folder specified by its value, which in this case is [/system/openai/front.files/search/].
 * 2. By default, hidden files will not be included in the result unless a [display-hidden] node is provided and set to boolean true.
 * 3. The slot returns a collection of nodes representing each file found within the specified folder.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Displaying all files available in the [/system/openai/front.files/search/] directory to a user interface.
