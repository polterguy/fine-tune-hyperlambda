/*
 * 1. [fork] is used to execute the enclosed logic asynchronously, allowing the process to run in parallel with other operations.
 * 2. [try] is used to handle exceptions during the execution of its child nodes, with a [.catch] block to manage errors if they occur.
 * 3. [execute] runs the [magic.ai.create-system-message] slot, passing in [url], [template], and [instruction] arguments from the [.arguments] node.
 * 4. [unwrap] is used to extract the [message] node from the result of the [execute] slot, making its value available for further processing.
 * 5. [sockets.signal] sends a message to the specified [channel] (from [.arguments]) and targets users with the [root] role, transmitting the generated [message] as an argument.
 * 6. In the [.catch] block, [unwrap] extracts error information, and [sockets.signal] sends an error notification to the same [channel], including an [ERROR] message and any additional error details from the exception.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Asynchronously generate a system message using AI and broadcast it to administrators or root users via a socket channel.
 * - Notify root users in real time if an error occurs during AI message generation, including error details for debugging.
 * - Integrate automated system notifications or alerts into a real-time dashboard for privileged users.
