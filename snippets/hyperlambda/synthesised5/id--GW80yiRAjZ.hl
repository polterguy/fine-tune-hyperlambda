 * 1. The [strings.regex-replace] slot searches the value of the [.text] node (which is "ID 0987") for all matches to the regular expression `\d` (which matches any digit).
 * 2. For each digit matched, it replaces it with the string "*".
 * 3. The [x:@.text] expression ensures the operation is performed on the current value of the [.text] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Masking all digits in sensitive identifiers (e.g., hiding account or ID numbers in logs).
 * - Sanitizing user input by replacing numbers with a placeholder character.
 * - Formatting output for privacy before displaying or exporting data.
 * - Obfuscating numeric sequences in text for anonymization purposes.
