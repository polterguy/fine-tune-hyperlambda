/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot sends a SignalR message to all clients subscribed to the channel specified by the value of the [channel] node found at the path `:x:@.arguments/@.arguments/*/channel`.
 * 2. The [roles] node restricts the message to only users with the "root" role.
 * 3. The [args] node defines the payload of the message, setting [message] to "ERROR" and [extra] to the value of the [message] node found at `:x:@.arguments/*/message`.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Broadcasting an error notification to all "root" users subscribed to a dynamic channel, including extra error details.
 * - Sending administrative alerts to privileged users when a specific error occurs, with context-specific information.
 * - Notifying root users in real time about system failures or exceptions, passing along the original error message for further analysis.
