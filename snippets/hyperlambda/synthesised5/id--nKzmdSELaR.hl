/*
 * 1. The [http.post] slot initiates an HTTP POST request to the specified URL, in this case "https://YOUR_CLOUDLET_URL/magic/modules/foo/foo".
 * 2. The [headers] child sets the "Content-Type" header to "multipart/form-data", indicating that the request will use the multipart form data format commonly used for file uploads and mixed content.
 * 3. The [payload] node defines the multipart body of the request, containing two [entity] nodes.
 * 4. The first [entity] node is of type text/plain and includes its own [headers] specifying "Content-Disposition" as form-data with a name of "foo". Its [content] node provides the string "Foo bar" as the value.
 * 5. The second [entity] node is also text/plain but its [headers] specify "Content-Disposition" with a filename of "README.md". The [filename] node points to "/README.md", indicating a file on the server will be attached and sent as part of the request.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Uploading a text value alongside a file to a backend service, such as submitting a form with an attached document.
 * - Sending structured multipart data to an API endpoint that expects both simple fields and file uploads in the same request.
 * - Automating file transfers and metadata submission to another server, such as sending logs or reports with associated descriptions.
 * - Interacting with APIs that require multipart/form-data for both file content and additional parameters, like image upload forms with descriptive fields.
