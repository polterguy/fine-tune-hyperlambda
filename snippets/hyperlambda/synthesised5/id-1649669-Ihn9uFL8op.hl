/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot assigns a new value to all nodes referenced by the expression `:x:@.profile.result`. This means all nodes named [.profile.result] will have their values updated.
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node(s) referenced by the expression `:x:@http.get/*/content/*/name`. This means it looks for all [name] nodes that are children of any [content] node, which in turn are children of the result of a [http.get] invocation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - After performing an HTTP GET request, extract the [name] field from the response and store it in the [.profile.result] node.
 * - Map a specific value from an external API response directly into a profile result node for later use.
 * - Update a user's profile result with the latest name information fetched from a remote service.
