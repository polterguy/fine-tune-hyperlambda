/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates over each child node of [@signal], executing its child nodes for every such node and passing the current node by reference into [.dp].
 * 2. The [unwrap] slot is used to traverse and evaluate the next siblingâ€™s descendants at three levels deep, likely extracting a nested structure for processing in each iteration.
 * 3. The [add] slot appends a new node structure to the location specified by the complex expression `:x:@for-each/@for-each/@.dp/#/*/tables/0/-/*/columns`. This inserts the generated node(s) into the [columns] node of the previous table node in the current context.
 * 4. Inside [add], a new node is constructed with properties [name], [db], [nullable], [primary], [automatic], and [hl], each set by fetching the respective value from the referenced node in [.dp].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Transforming and enriching table column definitions by mapping properties from one structure into another during a data migration step.
 * - Building up a new set of column metadata for tables in response to signal-based input, such as dynamically generating schemas.
 * - Aggregating deeply nested data under a [signal] node into a flattened or differently structured format for later consumption.
 * - Appending new columns to table definitions as part of a code generation or database synchronization routine.
