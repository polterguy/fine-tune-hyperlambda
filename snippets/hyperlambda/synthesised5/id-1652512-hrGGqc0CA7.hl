/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return values from a dynamic slot or an endpoint. It evaluates its children before returning them.
 * 2. The [evens] node is set to the value(s) referenced by the expression `:x:@.even_numbers`, which retrieves the value(s) of the [even_numbers] node in the current context.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a list of even numbers from a dynamic slot or endpoint after computation.
 * - Serving the results of a filtering operation (e.g., extracting even numbers from an input list) to the caller.
 * - Providing a standardized output structure for downstream processing or API responses.
