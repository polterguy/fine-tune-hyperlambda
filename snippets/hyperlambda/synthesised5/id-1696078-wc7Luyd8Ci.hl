/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot is used to retrieve the value from a specific node, as determined by the expression provided in its value argument.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.sql` points to the first ancestor or sibling node named [.sql], so [get-value] will return whatever value is currently set for that node.
 * 3. This pattern is typically used to extract dynamic values from a lambda graph, making it easy to reference and reuse values elsewhere in your logic.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Pulling the SQL query string from a [.sql] node to pass it to another database-related slot.
 * - Fetching a previously constructed SQL statement for logging, debugging, or auditing purposes.
 * - Dynamically referencing and executing different SQL commands based on user input or configuration.
