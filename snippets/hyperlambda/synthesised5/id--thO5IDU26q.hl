/*
 * 1. The [image.convert] slot is used to transform an image from one format to another.
 * 2. The [file] node specifies the source image path, in this case [/input.png].
 * 3. The [output] node defines the destination path where the converted image will be saved, here as [/output.jpg].
 * 4. The conversion process will determine the output format from the [output] file extension (".jpg" implies JPEG).
 * 5. If no [type] node is provided, the slot uses the target file extension to decide the output image format.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Batch convert PNG images to JPEG format for web optimization.
 * - Change image file formats to meet third-party API requirements.
 * - Save screenshots as smaller JPEG files instead of PNG to reduce storage size.
 * - Automate format conversion in a file upload workflow.
 * - Prepare images for use in applications that only accept specific formats.
