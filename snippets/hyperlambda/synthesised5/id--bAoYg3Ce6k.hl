/*
 * 1. The [.count] node is being assigned a value of -123, explicitly typing it as a 16-bit signed integer (`short`). This means the value stored in [.count] is -123, and it will be treated as a short integer in any further processing.
 * 2. The type declaration ensures that any operation referencing [.count] will interpret its value as a short, enabling correct type-based comparisons, conversions, or arithmetic.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Storing a negative count or indicator value for later validation or error checking in a workflow.
 * - Passing a specifically typed count value as an argument to a slot that requires a 16-bit integer.
 * - Demonstrating how to assign and enforce numeric types on data nodes for scenarios requiring strict type safety.
