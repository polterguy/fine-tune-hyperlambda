/*
 * 1. The [exists] slot checks whether a node named [snippets] exists as a direct child of the [signal] node. It uses the expression `:x:@signal/*/snippets` to locate the [snippets] node under [signal].
 * 2. The result of [exists] will be a boolean value: true if the [snippets] node exists under [signal], or false if it does not.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To conditionally execute code only if a [snippets] node is present under [signal].
 * - To validate the structure of a lambda object before performing operations that require the [snippets] node.
 * - To prevent errors by checking for the existence of [snippets] before attempting to access or modify it.
