/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks a condition and executes its [.lambda] block only if the condition is true.
 * 2. The [and] slot combines multiple conditions, requiring all to be true for the [.lambda] to execute.
 * 3. The [eq] slot is used twice to confirm that [.user-role] is "premium" and [.subscription] is "active".
 * 4. The [lt] slot checks if [.days-left] is less than 7.
 * 5. If all conditions are met, [set-value] updates [.user-message] to "Subscription expires soon".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Alerting users with a premium, active subscription as their expiration approaches.
 * - Notifying users when their subscription is within a week of expiring.
 * - Ensuring only valid, premium subscribers see the upcoming expiration message.
 * - Automating reminders for time-sensitive account statuses.
