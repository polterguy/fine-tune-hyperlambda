/*
 * 1. The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate the expression `:x:../*/cache.try-get/**/.databaseType` and return the resulting values.
 * 2. The expression navigates up one level in the node hierarchy (`..`), selects all sibling nodes (`*`), then finds any [cache.try-get] child nodes, and recursively searches all their descendants (`**`) for nodes named [.databaseType].
 * 3. The overall effect is to aggregate the values of all [.databaseType] nodes found anywhere under all [cache.try-get] nodes that are siblings to the parent node of the current context, by evaluating and unwrapping their values.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting all database type configurations used in cache-backed data retrievals within a given scope.
 * - Auditing which database types are being cached by different [cache.try-get] invocations in a workflow.
 * - Gathering metadata about database usage patterns without hardcoding node paths.
 * - Dynamically building a report or diagnostics panel showing database adapters in use for cached data access logic.
