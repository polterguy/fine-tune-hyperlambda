/*
 * 1. The [exists] slot checks for the existence of a node at the specified path. In this case, the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/offset` navigates to any [offset] node that is a direct child of any child node under [.arguments]. The [exists] slot will return true if at least one such [offset] node exists.
 * 
 * 2. This check is often used to determine if a particular argument, namely [offset], has been supplied to an endpoint, allowing for conditional logic based on its presence.
 * 
 * 3. Common use cases:
 *    - Verify if an optional pagination parameter ([offset]) is provided in an API request before applying pagination logic.
 *    - Conditionally trigger default value assignment for [offset] only if it is not present.
 *    - Perform validation or transformation only if the [offset] argument exists in the provided arguments.
