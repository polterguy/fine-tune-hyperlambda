/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the node that matches the expression `:x:@.sql`. This means it searches for the first node named [.sql] in the current execution context and returns its value.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.sql` ensures that only the first [.sql] node found is selected, and [get-value] extracts its value, not its children, type, or name.
 * 3. This slot is typically used when you need to access the value of a node for further logic or to output it elsewhere in your Hyperlambda graph.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the raw SQL string from a previously generated [.sql] node to display or log it for debugging purposes.
 * - Passing the value of [.sql] as an argument to another slot that requires the actual SQL statement rather than the whole node object.
 * - Validating or transforming the SQL string before execution by retrieving it from the [.sql] node.
