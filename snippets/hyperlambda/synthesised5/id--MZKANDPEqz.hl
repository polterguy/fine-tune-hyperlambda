/*
 * 1. The [semaphore] slot with value "foo-bar" establishes a named semaphore, ensuring that only one thread at a time can execute the code inside this [semaphore:foo-bar] block. This is useful for synchronizing access to shared resources.
 * 2. Any subsequent [semaphore:foo-bar] invocation anywhere in the code will refer to the same lock, meaning concurrent threads attempting to enter a [semaphore:foo-bar] section must wait for the lock to be released before proceeding.
 * 3. The slot does not perform any work by itself; it acts as a guard, so all child nodes beneath [semaphore:foo-bar] are guaranteed exclusive access while the semaphore is held.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Protecting access to a file or database record to prevent race conditions during concurrent writes.
 * - Ensuring only one process at a time updates a shared cache or session state.
 * - Serializing access to an external API that does not support concurrent connections.
