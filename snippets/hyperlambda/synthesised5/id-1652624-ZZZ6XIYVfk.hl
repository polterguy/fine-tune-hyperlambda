/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return a value or a set of nodes from a dynamic slot or an endpoint.
 * 2. The [yield] slot will forward evaluate any expressions found in its children, so the value of the [enriched] node will be set to the result of the expression `:x:@.artists`.
 * 3. The [enriched] node will be included in the returned result, containing the value or nodes referenced by [.artists].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a processed or enriched list of artists from a dynamic slot after performing some transformation or enrichment.
 * - Outputting the result of a database or API query stored in [.artists] to the caller of a Hyperlambda endpoint.
 * - Passing the value of [.artists] as the main result of a reusable Hyperlambda function.
