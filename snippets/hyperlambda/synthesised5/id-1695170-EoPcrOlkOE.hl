/*
 * 1. The [convert] slot is used here to change the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.dp/#` to a different type.
 * 2. The [type] child node specifies "string" as the target type, instructing [convert] to convert the referenced value into a string, regardless of its original type.
 * 3. The `:x:@.dp/#` expression dereferences the value of the [.dp] node (commonly used as the current node in [for-each] or similar slots) by reference, ensuring that the original node's value is actually modified.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Converting integer or boolean values within each node of a collection to string representations, for tasks like exporting or displaying data.
 * - Ensuring all data in a set is string-typed before serialization to JSON or CSV, which expects string values.
 * - Preparing values for string manipulation operations, such as concatenation or formatting, by standardizing data types.
