/*
 * 1. The [.data] node is created with a child node [foo] that has the value "bar".
 * 2. The [not-null] slot is invoked with the expression `:x:@.data/*/foo`, which points to the [foo] node under [.data].
 * 3. [not-null] checks if any nodes returned by the expression exist and have a non-null value.
 * 4. Since [foo] exists and its value is "bar", [not-null] will evaluate to true.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To verify that a required property exists and is set before performing operations.
 * - As a validation step to ensure configuration or input data is present.
 * - In data transformation flows to check if a node should be included in output because it has a value.
 * - For conditional branching: only execute further logic if a specific data field is present and non-empty.
