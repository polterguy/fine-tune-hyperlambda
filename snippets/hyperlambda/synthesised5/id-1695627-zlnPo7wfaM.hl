/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot dynamically signals a message to the channel specified by the value of the [feedback-channel] node inside [.arguments]. This channel name is determined at runtime based on the incoming arguments.
 * 2. The [args] node encapsulates the data to be transmitted. It contains two children: [message], which forwards the value from [.arguments]â€™s [message] node, and [type], which is statically set to "warning". These will be serialized to JSON before being sent.
 * 3. This construct enables real-time transmission of warning-type feedback messages to all clients subscribed to the specified feedback channel.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Sending a warning notification to a user-specific or dynamically determined feedback channel in response to certain events.
 * - Broadcasting warning messages to a group of clients (e.g., all admins) about system state or validation issues in real time.
 * - Providing front-end applications with immediate feedback about non-critical issues that need user attention.
