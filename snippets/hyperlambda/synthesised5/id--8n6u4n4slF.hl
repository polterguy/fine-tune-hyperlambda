/*
 * 1. The [io.file.list] slot retrieves a list of files from the directory specified by its value, which is [/etc/hyperlambda-training-material/hyperlambda/]. Each file path is made available as a child node of [io.file.list].
 * 2. The [.no] node is initialized to 0 and serves as a counter.
 * 3. The [for-each] slot iterates through every child node (i.e., file) returned by [io.file.list], referencing each file node as [.dp] within the loop.
 * 4. Inside the loop, an [if] condition checks whether the file name (value of [.dp/#]) ends with the string ".hl" using [strings.ends-with].
 * 5. If the file name ends with ".hl", the [math.increment] slot increases the value of [.no] by 1.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Counting how many Hyperlambda (*.hl) files exist in a given directory.
 * - Filtering a directory listing to identify files by extension and performing an action for each match.
 * - Automating statistics gathering for source files in a training materials folder.
 * - Dynamically processing only files with a specific extension within a directory.
 * - Preparing to trigger further processing, such as batch operations, on all Hyperlambda files found.
