/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to add new nodes to the node(s) referenced by its expression. In this case, it targets all sibling nodes named [signal] at the same level as the current node.
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all child nodes of the [values] node, which is a child of the [.arguments] node. This means it collects all nodes under [.arguments]/[values] and prepares them to be added.
 * 3. The result is that all nodes under [.arguments]/[values] are added as children to every [signal] node that is a sibling of the current node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically inject a set of configuration or data nodes into multiple [signal] nodes for further processing.
 * - Aggregate user-provided values and attach them to workflow signal nodes in a pipeline.
 * - Populate event or signal nodes with a batch of values supplied at runtime through the [.arguments]/[values] structure.
