/*
 * 1. The [response.headers.set] slot is used to set specific HTTP response headers for the outgoing response. This allows customization of the HTTP response sent back to the client.
 * 2. The [Content-Type] header is set to "application/pdf", which tells the client that the response body contains a PDF file.
 * 3. The [Content-Disposition] header is set dynamically using the value from the [strings.concat] slot. This is typically used to control how the browser handles the file (e.g., as an attachment with a specific filename).
 * 4. The [Access-Control-Expose-Headers] header is set to "Content-Disposition", which allows browsers to access the Content-Disposition header in cross-origin requests, making it available to client-side JavaScript.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a dynamically generated PDF file to the client and prompting a download with a specific filename.
 * - Allowing JavaScript running in the browser to access the Content-Disposition header after downloading a file from a different origin.
 * - Customizing HTTP response headers for file downloads to control file handling and CORS behavior.
