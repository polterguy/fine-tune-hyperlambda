/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.sql`. This means it will look for a sibling or ancestor node named [.sql] and return its value.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.sql` uses the `@` iterator to select the first [.sql] node found before this node in the hierarchy.
 * 3. The result of [get-value] will be the data or content stored in the [.sql] node, which could be a string, number, or any other supported type.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Accessing and utilizing the SQL string or command stored in a [.sql] node for further processing or debugging.
 * - Retrieving dynamically generated SQL queries from earlier steps in a workflow.
 * - Passing the value of [.sql] to another slot that requires the SQL statement as an input.
 * - Logging or displaying the current SQL being worked on for transparency or auditing.
 * - Validating the contents of the [.sql] node before executing it against a database.
