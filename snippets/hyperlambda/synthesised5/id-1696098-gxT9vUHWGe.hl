/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to append nodes to a collection. In this example, it takes as input the result of the expression `:x:@data.connect/*/data.select`, which refers to all [data.select] nodes that are children of any node under [data.connect].
 * 2. The lambda object provided to [add] is executed for each node in the resulting node set, with the currently iterated node being passed by reference through the [.dp] node.
 * 3. Inside the lambda, a child node with a value set to the reference of [.dp] is created, effectively copying the referenced node into the destination collection.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Aggregating SQL query result sets from multiple [data.select] nodes into a single list for further processing or export.
 * - Dynamically building a new node structure by collecting and appending nodes from different sources under [data.connect].
 * - Merging data retrieved from several database queries into one Hyperlambda node set for easier iteration or transformation.
 * - Creating a unified list of records when results are fetched from multiple databases or tables.
