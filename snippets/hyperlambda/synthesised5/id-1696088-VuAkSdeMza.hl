/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot takes all values from the nodes selected by the expression `:x:@.sql` and concatenates them into a single string.  
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [.sql] node and uses it as one of the items to be concatenated.  
 * 3. The child node with value ":) as keyword_count" is also included in the concatenation, appending this specific string to the result.  
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Building SQL statements dynamically by appending additional clauses, such as creating an aggregate alias in a SELECT statement.
 * - Generating custom output strings that require combining a variable value with a static suffix or prefix.
 * - Creating readable log messages or code fragments by joining dynamic and static string parts together.
 * - Forming labels or descriptions based on user input and predefined formatting templates.
