/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot combines several string values into a single string. Its value expression `:x:@.sql` points to a node whose value is included as the first element in the concatenation.
 * 2. [get-value] retrieves the value of the node referenced by `:x:@.sql` (the current SQL string being built).
 * 3. The static string node [.: " offset "] adds a literal " offset " to the concatenated result, typically used for SQL pagination.
 * 4. Another [get-value] fetches the value of [.offset] from the [.arguments] node, which likely represents the desired offset for the SQL query.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Dynamically append an OFFSET clause to an SQL statement based on user-provided pagination parameters.
 * - Create a final SQL query string by combining previously generated SQL with additional clauses.
 * - Reuse and extend an existing SQL string by adding new parts, allowing for customizable query construction.
 * - Build SQL queries in a modular way, where each clause (such as OFFSET) is appended only if specific arguments are present.
