/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node declares the start of argument definitions for an HTTP endpoint or function, ensuring proper input handling.
 * 2. The [data.connect] node establishes a connection to the database named "erp" before any data operations are performed.
 * 3. The [data.select] slot executes the raw SQL statement `select * from item`, retrieving all records and columns from the [item] table in the connected database.
 * 4. The [yield] slot returns the result of the query, specifically all child nodes of [data.select], as a [rows] node, effectively exposing the fetched records as output.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating an endpoint that returns all items from the [item] table in an ERP system.
 * - Building a data export feature that fetches and exposes all product or inventory records for external processing.
 * - Providing a backend API for a dashboard that needs to display a list of all available items.
 * - Serving as a base for additional filtering or pagination logic on the [item] data.
