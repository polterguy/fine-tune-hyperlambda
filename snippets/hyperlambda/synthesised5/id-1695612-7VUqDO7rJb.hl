/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.title2] node by assigning it the result of its child slot.
 * 2. [strings.trim] is used to remove specific characters (whitespace and double quotes) from both ends of the value currently in [.title2].
 * 3. The [.] child node under [strings.trim] specifies which characters to trim; in this case, it trims spaces and double quotes.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up user input where extra spaces and quotes might have been accidentally entered.
 * - Normalizing imported text data, ensuring values do not have unwanted surrounding whitespace or punctuation.
 * - Preparing strings for display or further processing by removing formatting artifacts.
 * - Stripping unwanted characters from configuration values loaded into [.title2].
