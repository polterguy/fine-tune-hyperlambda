/*
 * 1. The [lambda2hyper] slot is invoked with an expression targeting all child nodes of the [.result] node, converting the referenced lambda structure into a Hyperlambda-formatted string representation.
 * 2. The `:x:@.result/*` expression fetches every immediate child node of [.result], so the serialization will be applied to each of these nodes, not [.result] itself.
 * 3. The output of this slot is a textual Hyperlambda, which can be persisted, transmitted, or displayed as needed.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Exporting the content under [.result] as Hyperlambda text for backup or migration to another system.
 * - Serializing response data for logging or auditing the exact structure of processed results.
 * - Preparing dynamically assembled lambda nodes for storage in a text-based format, such as saving workflow definitions or configuration snapshots.
