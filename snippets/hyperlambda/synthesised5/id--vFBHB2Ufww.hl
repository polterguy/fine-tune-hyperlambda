/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a connection to the [ecommerce_db] database, enabling subsequent database operations within its scope.
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies that the database in use is Microsoft SQL Server (mssql), ensuring correct adapter selection for all child operations.
 * 3. The [data.create] slot inserts a new record into the [orders] table, using the provided [values] for the new row.
 * 4. The nested [values] node contains the specific data to be inserted: [order_id], [user_id], [total], and [order_date], each with explicit type declarations to enforce data integrity.
 * 5. The inclusion of [database-type] at both the connection and creation levels guarantees that all relevant operations are executed using the intended database type, which is particularly useful when multiple database systems are present.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating a new order entry when a customer completes a purchase in an e-commerce application.
 * - Populating the [orders] table with initial data during system setup or testing.
 * - Ensuring type-safe data insertion in environments where multiple database backends are supported.
 * - Automating bulk data import tasks by repeating this pattern with different order information.
