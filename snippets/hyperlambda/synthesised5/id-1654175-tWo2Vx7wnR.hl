/*
 * 1. The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate and return the values of all nodes referenced by the expression `:x:./*/signal/*/.onafter/*/.feedback-channel`. This means it will traverse the current node's parent, then for each child, it will look for a [signal] node, then for each of its children, it will look for an [.onafter] node, then for each of its children, it will retrieve the [.feedback-channel] nodes and evaluate their values.
 * 2. The expression allows for collecting feedback or results from multiple [.feedback-channel] nodes that are nested within a specific structure under [signal] and [.onafter] nodes, aggregating their values into the current context.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Gathering all feedback channel values after a set of signal invocations to process or log them.
 * - Aggregating communication channel identifiers for post-processing after event handling.
 * - Collecting user or system feedback from multiple signal processing steps for further analysis.
