/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the node identified by the expression `:x:@.sql`. This expression searches for the first node named [.sql] in the current context and extracts its value for further use.
 * 2. [get-value] is frequently used to access node values dynamically, allowing other logic to utilize or manipulate the extracted data as needed.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the SQL query string stored under a [.sql] node to execute or log the query.
 * - Accessing configuration or command values saved under a [.sql] node for dynamic processing.
 * - Retrieving template or placeholder content from the [.sql] node for use in constructing more complex SQL queries or related operations.
