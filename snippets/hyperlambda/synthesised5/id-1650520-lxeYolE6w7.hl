/*
 * 1. The [type] slot is used to return the Hyperlambda type name of a value.
 * 2. In this example, [type] is invoked with a static value of "string" as its argument, so the result of executing this code will be a node named [type] with its value set to "string".
 * 3. The [type] slot can be used to dynamically determine or confirm the type of a node's value, which is useful for type checking, validation, or debugging purposes.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Checking the type of a value before performing type-specific operations or conversions.
 * - Validating input data to ensure it matches the expected type.
 * - Debugging workflows by outputting the type of certain nodes to logs or responses.
