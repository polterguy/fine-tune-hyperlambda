/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot assigns a new value to the [.result] node using the output of [strings.concat].
 * 2. The [strings.concat] slot constructs a greeting message by concatenating several string fragments, including static text and values retrieved from the [.arguments] node, specifically [.name] and [.age].
 * 3. The [get-value] slot is used to extract the values of [.name] and [.age] from the [.arguments] node.
 * 4. The [yield] slot returns the final result, making [.result] available as the output.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating a simple API endpoint that returns a personalized greeting based on user-provided name and age.
 * - Generating dynamic messages for chatbots or virtual assistants that acknowledge user-specific information.
 * - Formatting user data for display in a user interface or as part of an automated email response.
 * - Demonstrating basic string manipulation and data retrieval in Hyperlambda for educational purposes.
