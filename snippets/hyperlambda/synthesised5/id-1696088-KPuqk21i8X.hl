/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/offset`. This means it will look for a child node named [offset] under any child of the [.arguments] node and return its value.
 * 2. The expression uses `@.arguments` to locate the [.arguments] node in the current context, then `*` to access all its children, and finally `/offset` to filter children named [offset].
 * 3. This slot is typically used to extract a specific parameter or argument value from a structured input, often in HTTP endpoints or when processing input data.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving the value of an [offset] parameter from the arguments in a paginated API endpoint.
 * - Accessing a user-supplied offset value for use in database queries or calculations.
 * - Reading configurable offsets from input nodes during workflow or batch processing.
