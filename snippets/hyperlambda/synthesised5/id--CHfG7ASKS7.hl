/*
 * 1. The [.html] node contains an HTML document, but all the angle brackets and special characters are HTML-encoded (e.g., `&lt;` instead of `<`).
 * 2. The [strings.html-decode] slot is applied to the value of the [.html] node using the expression `:x:@.html`, which decodes any HTML entities into their literal characters.
 * 3. The result is an HTML string with proper tags, where encoded entities are converted back to their original symbols.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Decoding HTML-encoded strings retrieved from databases or APIs before further processing or rendering.
 * - Preparing HTML content that was sanitized or escaped for safe storage, and needs to be restored to its original form.
 * - Converting encoded user input or configuration values back into readable HTML for preview or email composition.
