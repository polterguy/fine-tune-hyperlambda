/*
 * 1. The [http.get] slot initiates an HTTP GET request to the specified URL ("https://google.com") and is responsible for retrieving the resource from the remote server.
 * 2. The [headers] node is used to customize the HTTP request by specifying HTTP headers. In this example, it sets the "Accept" header to "text/html", indicating that the client expects an HTML response from the server.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the HTML content of a web page for further processing or parsing.
 * - Checking the status code and headers of an HTTP response for monitoring or testing web services.
 * - Automating the retrieval of web resources that require specific header configurations.
 * - Integrating with external web services that expect custom HTTP headers for content negotiation.
