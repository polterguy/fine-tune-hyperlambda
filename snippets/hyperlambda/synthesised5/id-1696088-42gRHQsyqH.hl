/*
 * 1. The [strings.split] slot is used to split the value of the [.query] node inside [.arguments] into multiple substrings, using a space character as the delimiter, creating separate nodes for each word.
 * 2. The [add] slot is invoked with the expression `:x:@.words`, adding (appending) the resulting nodes from [strings.split] to the node set referenced by [.words].
 * 3. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/query` retrieves the [.query] node under [.arguments], and uses its value as the input string to be split.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Tokenizing a user's search query into individual words for further processing or search indexing.
 * - Splitting input phrases into parts to build a list of keywords.
 * - Preparing a set of words from a sentence for NLP or text analysis tasks.
 * - Enriching an existing [.words] node set with additional tokens derived from user input.
