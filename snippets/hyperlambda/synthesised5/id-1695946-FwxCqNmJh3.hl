/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node(s) referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it will look for the first ancestor or sibling node named [.fields] and return its value.
 * 2. If [.fields] contains structured or simple data, [get-value] will extract only the value part, not the children or the node itself.
 * 3. This slot is commonly used to access user input, settings, or results that have been previously stored in a [.fields] node elsewhere in the execution tree.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting a user's form input from a [.fields] node to use for further processing or validation.
 * - Retrieving configuration data stored in a [.fields] node for decision-making logic.
 * - Accessing database query results that have been saved under [.fields] for formatting or output.
