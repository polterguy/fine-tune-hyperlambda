/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks if the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/type` yields any nodes using the [exists] slot. If it does, the condition is true and the [.lambda] block is executed.
 * 2. Inside the [.lambda], the [unwrap] slot evaluates all expressions found in the next sibling's children, effectively preparing any dynamic expressions for use.
 * 3. The [add] slot appends a new node to the [and] node under [where], which is under [data.read], which in turn is under [data.connect]. The new node is a [type.eq] node that checks if the type matches the value found at `:x:@.arguments/*/type`.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically add a type-based filter to a database query if a type argument is provided.
 * - Conditionally build a query by checking for the existence of optional parameters.
 * - Extend filtering logic in a data retrieval process only when specific arguments are present.
