/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot is used here with the expression `:x:@.input/*/payload/#/*/age` to extract the value from a specific [age] node nested deep within the structure of the [.input] node.
 * 2. The expression traverses the child nodes of [.input], then accesses a [payload] node, dereferences its value as a node (with `#`), retrieves its children, and finally accesses the [age] node.
 * 3. The result of [get-value] will be the actual value stored in the targeted [age] node, and this value is set as the value of the [.age-value] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting a user's age from a complex input payload received via HTTP to perform age-based logic.
 * - Normalizing nested data structures so that commonly used fields like age are more easily accessible elsewhere in the lambda graph.
 * - Preparing specific values for further validation, comparison, or storage by flattening deeply nested data.
 * - Aggregating or logging user demographic data by extracting and storing [age] from a standardized payload format.
