/*
 * 1. The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks if the current authenticated user has at least one of the roles provided ("admin", "editor", or "user"). 
 * 2. If the user is not a member of any of these roles, an exception is thrown and the execution halts, preventing unauthorized access.
 * 3. This slot is typically used at the beginning of HTTP endpoint implementations to enforce role-based access control.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Restricting sensitive API endpoints to users with administrative or editorial permissions.
 * - Ensuring that only registered users (with the "user" role) can access certain features or resources.
 * - Validating user roles before allowing actions such as content creation, editing, or management within an application.
