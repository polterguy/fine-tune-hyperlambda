/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of a node specified by its expression argument.  
 * 2. The expression `@xml2lambda/**/PRICE/*/\#text` navigates the node structure starting from a node named [xml2lambda], traversing all its descendants to find a [PRICE] node, then its children, and finally looks for a child named [#text].  
 * 3. The double backslash in `\\#text` is used to escape the `#` character, ensuring the expression correctly targets nodes named [#text], which typically hold text content extracted from XML or HTML.  
 * 4. The value returned by [get-value] will be the text content contained within the [PRICE] element from the original XML converted to a lambda structure.
 * 
 * **Use Cases:**
 * - Extracting the price value from XML data after it has been converted to a lambda object using [xml2lambda].
 * - Parsing and retrieving specific content from deeply nested XML or HTML documents.
 * - Reusing this logic to automate the extraction of similar fields (like cost, amount, label) in data-processing tasks.
 * - Using the result as a basis for further business logic, such as applying discounts or validating price formats.
