/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot is used here to delete specific nodes within a signal's execution tree.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@signal/*/*/db/=msdb` targets all descendant nodes named [db] (regardless of their parent), but only those whose value is exactly "msdb".
 * 3. When executed, all matching [db] nodes with the value "msdb" under any child of [signal] will be removed from the node hierarchy.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up or filtering out connections or references to the "msdb" database from a list of database configuration nodes.
 * - Ensuring certain operations do not include nodes related to "msdb" by programmatically removing them before further processing.
 * - Sanitizing input data or configuration trees by excluding specific database nodes that should not be acted upon.
