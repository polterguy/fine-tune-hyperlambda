/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks if the file specified by the result of the [strings.concat] expression exists using the [io.file.exists] slot.
 * 2. If the file exists, the [.lambda] child is executed, which throws an exception using the [throw] slot with the message "Database already exists", marks the exception as public by setting [public] to true, and sets the HTTP status code to 400.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Preventing the creation of a new database file if one already exists.
 * - Ensuring unique file creation by throwing an error if a file with the intended name is found.
 * - Providing a user-friendly error message and HTTP status code when attempting to overwrite existing resources.
