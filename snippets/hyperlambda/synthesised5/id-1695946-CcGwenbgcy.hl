/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node or nodes referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it accesses the value of the [fields] node that exists as a direct child of the current nodeâ€™s parent.
 * 2. The `@.fields` expression uses the `@` iterator to find the first ancestor or sibling node named [fields], and [get-value] returns its value.
 * 3. This approach is commonly used to extract configuration, user input, or any data stored under a [fields] node for further processing in the Hyperlambda execution flow.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching user-submitted form data stored in a [fields] node for validation or transformation.
 * - Accessing query parameters or request payload data structured under [fields] within an HTTP endpoint.
 * - Reusing a single [fields] node to provide context or settings for multiple operations in a dynamic workflow.
