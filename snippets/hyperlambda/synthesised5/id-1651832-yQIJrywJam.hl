 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [url] node inside the [.arguments] node to a new value.
 * 2. The [strings.to-lower] slot is used as the source for [set-value], converting the current value of the [url] node to all lowercase characters before assignment.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that a URL argument is always stored in lowercase for consistency before further processing or validation.
 * - Normalizing input data to prevent case-sensitive mismatches when comparing or storing URLs.
 * - Preparing a URL argument for use in systems or APIs that require lowercase URLs.
