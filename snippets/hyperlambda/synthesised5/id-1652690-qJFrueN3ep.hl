/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to select records from a database table.  
 * 2. The [table] node specifies the table to query, in this case [Order].  
 * 3. The [columns] node lists which columns to return from the table, here [OrderId] and [OrderDate].  
 * 4. The [where] node defines a filter condition for the query.  
 * 5. The [and] node allows for multiple conditions to be combined, but here only one is used.  
 * 6. The [CustomerId.eq] node compares the [CustomerId] column to a value obtained from the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/CustomerId`, which dynamically resolves the value from another node in the execution context.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve all orders for a specific customer, returning only the order ID and order date.
 * - Use as part of a workflow to display a customerâ€™s order history in a dashboard.
 * - Filter orders by customer in an automated process, such as generating a report or sending notifications.
