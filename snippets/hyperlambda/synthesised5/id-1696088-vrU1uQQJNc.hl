/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates all its child node values into a single string, in the order they appear.
 * 2. The [.:"coalesce("] and [.:", '')"] nodes provide static string fragments at the beginning and end of the concatenated result.
 * 3. The [get-value:x:@.dp/#] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by [.dp], which is typically passed in by reference during iteration or inclusion.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Generating a SQL expression like `coalesce(value, '')` for dynamic field names.
 * - Wrapping dynamic values with static text to construct function calls or statements.
 * - Building template strings for output or code generation that require inserting node values at specific positions.
