/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot sets the value of the [.apiKey] node to the result of its child slot.
 * 2. The [config.get] slot retrieves a configuration value using the path "system:env:api-key" from the application's configuration file.
 * 3. The expression `:x:-` in [set-value] targets the previous sibling node, which is [.apiKey], ensuring its value is updated.
 * 4. This pattern is a common way to initialize a node with a secret or environment-specific value from configuration at runtime.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically loading sensitive API keys from configuration without hardcoding them in source code.
 * - Ensuring all requests made with the API key always use the latest value from configuration.
 * - Facilitating deployment to different environments (dev, staging, prod) by retrieving configuration-specific secrets.
 * - Reducing risk of accidental key exposure in code repositories by using configuration files instead.
