/*
 * 1. The [hyper2lambda] slot is used to parse Hyperlambda code from text into a lambda object (a graph structure representing the code).
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/code` retrieves all [code] child nodes of every child node under the value of the [.dp] node, which is passed by reference.
 * 3. This transformation allows the textual representation of Hyperlambda contained in the selected [code] nodes to be converted into executable or processable lambda structures, enabling further manipulation or execution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Converting submitted or uploaded Hyperlambda code stored in a data structure for dynamic evaluation.
 * - Enabling users to edit or inject Hyperlambda code via a UI, which is then parsed into lambda objects for validation or execution.
 * - Preparing code snippets stored in configuration or user profiles for server-side processing or automation tasks.
 * - Supporting code versioning or transformation pipelines where code is stored as text and needs to be parsed into semantic objects.
