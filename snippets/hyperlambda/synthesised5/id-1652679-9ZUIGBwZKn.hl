/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot is used to read records from a database table, in this case from the [Publisher] table.
 * 2. The [limit] node restricts the number of records returned to 50, overriding the default limit of 25.
 * 3. The [columns] node specifies that only the [PublisherId] and [Name] columns will be selected from the [Publisher] table.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving a paginated list of publishers for display in an application, limited to 50 records at a time.
 * - Exporting a subset of publisher data (IDs and names) for reporting or integration purposes.
 * - Reducing database load by selecting only necessary columns and limiting the result set size.
