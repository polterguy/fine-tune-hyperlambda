/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a database connection to the database named "authDB", making it available for subsequent operations within its scope.
 * 2. The [data.execute] slot is used to execute a raw SQL statement. Here, it performs an UPDATE operation that sets the [last_login] field to NULL for all records in the [users] table where the [active] field is equal to 0. This slot does not retrieve or return any results from the database operation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Resetting the [last_login] timestamp for all inactive users in an authentication system.
 * - Performing mass updates to user records without expecting any result set.
 * - Integrating maintenance tasks in automation scripts where the outcome of the SQL command is not required.
 * - Cleaning up or anonymizing sensitive data for users flagged as inactive.
