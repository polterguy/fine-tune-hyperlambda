/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a connection to a database named "sakila", making it the active database context for subsequent operations.
 * 2. The [data.execute] slot executes the raw SQL command `delete from non_existing_table` against the connected database without expecting any result data to be returned.
 * 3. If the specified table ("non_existing_table") does not exist in the database, this operation will throw an error, demonstrating that [data.execute] will not suppress exceptions from failed SQL statements.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Running administrative SQL commands that do not return result sets, such as deleting records or updating table structures.
 * - Testing error handling by deliberately executing SQL statements against non-existent tables or invalid commands.
 * - Performing bulk updates or deletions where you do not need to process the result.
 * - Automating database maintenance tasks from within a Hyperlambda workflow.
