/*
 * 1. The [validators.default] slot checks if a child node named [vectorize] exists within the node collection referenced by `:x:@.arguments`. If [vectorize] does not exist, it appends it with the value [bool:false]. If [vectorize] already exists but has a null value, it sets its value to [false]. No action is taken if [vectorize] exists and already has a non-null value.
 * 2. The [vectorize] node is assigned a boolean value of false by default, ensuring downstream logic always has a defined value to work with for this parameter.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically set default configuration values for function arguments if they are not supplied by the caller.
 * - Ensure a boolean parameter such as [vectorize] always has a defined state, preventing null reference issues.
 * - Simplify endpoint logic by establishing fallback values for optional arguments.
