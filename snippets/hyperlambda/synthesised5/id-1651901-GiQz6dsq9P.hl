/*
 * 1. The [validators.string] slot validates that the value of the [databaseName] node inside each child of [.arguments] has a string length within specified constraints.
 * 2. The min:2 child node sets the minimum allowed length of the [databaseName] string to 2 characters.
 * 3. If any [databaseName] value is shorter than 2 characters, an exception will be thrown, preventing further execution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that user-provided database names are not too short when creating or configuring databases.
 * - Validating input fields in an API endpoint that requires a minimum length for database names.
 * - Preventing accidental creation of databases with empty or single-character names in administrative tools.
