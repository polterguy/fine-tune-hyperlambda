/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node with a value of * allows the endpoint to accept any argument, of any type or structure, without validation or restriction.
 * 2. The [auth.ticket.verify] slot ensures that only users with the "root" role (validated via JWT token) can access this endpoint.
 * 3. The [lambda2json] slot serializes all children of the [.arguments] node into a JSON string, and with [format:true], ensures the output is pretty-printed and human-readable.
 * 4. The [config.save] slot saves the resulting JSON string (produced by [lambda2json]) into the application's configuration store.
 * 5. The [return] slot sends back a result node with the value "success" to indicate the operation completed.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Saving dynamic and arbitrary configuration data provided by an authenticated root user.
 * - Creating an admin-only endpoint for backing up or updating application settings via JSON.
 * - Accepting complex payloads for runtime configuration changes, as long as the requestor is a root user.
 * - Enabling integration or migration scenarios where flexible configuration data needs to be persisted securely.
