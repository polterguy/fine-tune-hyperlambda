/*
 * 1. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple conditions and will only return true if all its child conditions are true.
 * 2. The [ProfessorId.eq] node is a comparison condition that checks if the value of [ProfessorId] is equal to the value obtained from the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/ProfessorId`. This uses the [eq] operator for equality comparison.
 * 3. The expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/ProfessorId` retrieves the [ProfessorId] node from the children of the node referenced by [.dp], which is typically passed in by reference during iteration (such as in a [for-each] loop).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Filtering a collection of nodes to only include those where the [ProfessorId] matches a specific value.
 * - Creating a conditional check inside a [for-each] loop to perform an action only when the [ProfessorId] of the current item matches a given value.
 * - Building complex logical conditions in data processing or validation scenarios where multiple equality checks are required.
