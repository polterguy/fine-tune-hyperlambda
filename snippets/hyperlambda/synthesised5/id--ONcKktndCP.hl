/*
 * 1. The [mysql.connect] slot establishes a connection to a MySQL database named "business".
 * 2. The [mysql.delete] slot deletes records from the [accounts] table where the [status] column is equal to "inactive". The [where] clause uses an [and] condition, but only one field is specified.
 * 3. The [yield] slot is used to return a response after the deletion, containing a [message] node indicating that inactive accounts were removed, and an [affected-records] node, which includes the number of deleted records by referencing the result of [mysql.delete].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Regularly clean up or archive deactivated user accounts in an application to keep the database tidy.
 * - Automate removal of obsolete records where status-based purging is required for compliance or performance.
 * - Build administrative tools that allow operators to trigger mass deletions based on account status.
