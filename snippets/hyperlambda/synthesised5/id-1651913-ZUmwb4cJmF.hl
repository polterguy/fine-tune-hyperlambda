/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to append new nodes as children to all nodes referenced by the expression `:x:../*/return-nodes`. For each such node, the lambda object provided as the second argument is executed.
 * 2. The lambda object under [add] creates a new anonymous node (with no name), which itself contains two child nodes: [name] and [columns].
 * 3. The [name] node's value is set dynamically using the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/name`, which retrieves the [name] node value from the currently iterated node referenced by [.dp].
 * 4. The [columns] node is created as an empty node under the anonymous parent.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically add a new structure containing a [name] and [columns] node to each [return-nodes] node in a collection, where [name] is copied from another node.
 * - Augment a result set with additional metadata or structure for each item in a list.
 * - Prepare a data structure for further processing, such as formatting or exporting, by adding standardized child nodes to each result node.
