/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks a condition and, if true, executes its [.lambda] child. Here, it verifies if the value of the [status] node under [.users]/[user1] is "active".
 * 2. The [eq] slot compares the [status] value of [user1] to the string "active". If they match, [eq] returns true.
 * 3. The [set-value] slot sets the value of the [.output] node to "Approved" if the condition is met.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Granting access to a user if their status is "active".
 * - Dynamically setting an output flag based on user status.
 * - Approving a workflow step only if a specified user's account is active.
 * - Implementing conditional branching for user state validation.
