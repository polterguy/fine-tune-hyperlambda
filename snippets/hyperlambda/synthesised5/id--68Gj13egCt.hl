/*
 * 1. [auth.ticket.verify] is used to check if the current authenticated user belongs to one or more specified roles—here, it checks for membership in the "non-existing-role" role.
 * 2. If the user does not belong to the given role(s), [auth.ticket.verify] immediately throws an exception, denying access and halting further execution.
 * 3. This slot is typically placed at the top of HTTP endpoint logic to enforce strict access control based on user roles.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Protecting an admin-only API endpoint by ensuring only users with a specific role can proceed.
 * - Blocking unauthorized users from accessing or modifying sensitive resources.
 * - Returning an error response if a user’s JWT token is missing the required role claim.
 * - Testing role-based security enforcement by intentionally specifying a role that does not exist to observe the error handling behavior.
