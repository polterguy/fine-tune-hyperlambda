/*
 * 1. The [data.delete] slot is used to delete records from a database table.  
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies the type of database being used, in this case, SQLite.  
 * 3. The [table] node indicates the target table for the delete operation, here it is [Order Details].  
 * 4. The [where] node, with an [and] child, is intended to define the conditions that must be met for records to be deleted. The [and] node allows for multiple conditions to be specified, but in this snippet, no specific conditions are provided yet.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Deleting all records from the [Order Details] table in a SQLite database when no conditions are specified under [and].
 * - Preparing a delete operation where multiple conditions will be added to the [and] node to selectively remove specific records.
 * - Integrating into a larger workflow where the [where] clause is dynamically constructed based on user input or business logic before executing the delete.
