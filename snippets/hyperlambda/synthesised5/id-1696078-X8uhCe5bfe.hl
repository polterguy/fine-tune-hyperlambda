/*
 * 1. The [exists] slot checks if a node exists at the path specified by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/offset`.
 * 2. The expression `@.arguments/*/offset` traverses all child nodes of [.arguments] and looks for nodes named [offset].
 * 3. The result is a boolean indicating whether at least one [offset] node is present within [.arguments].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Determine if an optional [offset] query or body parameter was supplied to an endpoint before applying pagination logic.
 * - Conditionally execute logic only if [offset] exists among request arguments, such as skipping a default value assignment.
 * - Validate payloads in endpoints where [offset] is only required under certain conditions, enabling branching based on its presence.
