/*
 * 1. The [return-nodes] slot is used to return a set of nodes from within a dynamic slot or context that supports returning nodes.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@tasks.list/*` references all child nodes of the [tasks.list] node, and passes these as the nodes to be returned.
 * 3. The result of this code is that all child nodes of [tasks.list] are returned as the output of the current slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a list of tasks from a dynamically created slot that aggregates or processes task data.
 * - Creating an API endpoint that exposes all tasks by returning the nodes under [tasks.list].
 * - Passing a filtered or processed set of nodes from one part of a workflow to another by returning them directly.
