/*
 * 1. [slots.create] defines a new dynamic slot named [foo]. The content of this slot specifies what is executed when it's invoked.
 * 2. [return-nodes] inside [foo] specifies the output when [foo] is called. It returns two nodes: [integer-value] with an integer value of 57, and [string-value] with a string value "Foo bar".
 * 3. [signal] is used to invoke the [foo] slot, causing the returned nodes from [return-nodes] to be attached as children to the [signal] node in the resulting lambda object.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning structured data (such as multiple values or objects) from a custom dynamic slot.
 * - Creating dynamic slots that serve as reusable data providers in workflows.
 * - Testing or demonstrating how to return multiple nodes (not just a single value) from a dynamic slot.
