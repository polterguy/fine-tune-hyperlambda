/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression argument. Here, the expression `:x:@.sql` points to the first node named [.sql] in the current execution context.
 * 2. By executing [get-value:x:@.sql], the value stored in the [.sql] node is extracted and returned for further use elsewhere in the Hyperlambda execution tree.
 * 3. This operation is useful for dynamically accessing configuration, SQL queries, or any data that might be stored in the [.sql] node, enabling other slots to work with or manipulate this value as needed.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching a SQL query string from [.sql] to pass it as input to a database execution slot.
 * - Reading a dynamically generated or previously stored command from [.sql] for logging or debugging.
 * - Using the value of [.sql] as a parameter in a subsequent operation, such as constructing a response or invoking another process.
