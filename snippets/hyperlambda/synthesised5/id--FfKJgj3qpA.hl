/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates over a subset of child nodes under [.items], specifically selecting the first two nodes using the `[0,2]` range filter in the expression (`:x:@.items/*/[0,2]`).  
 * 2. For each of these nodes, [set-value] updates the value of the currently iterated node (accessed by reference via [.dp/#]) to ":selected", overwriting any previous value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Marking the first N items in a list as "selected" in a UI workflow.
 * - Batch updating the values of a fixed subset of records, such as tagging the first two entries in a collection.
 * - Flagging a specific range of elements for additional processing or review.
