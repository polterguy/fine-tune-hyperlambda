/*
 * 1. The [strings.join] slot concatenates the values of all child nodes of [.fields], separating each value with the string " || ".
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.fields/*` collects all child nodes under [.fields] to be included in the join operation.
 * 3. The separator used between each string in the resulting joined string is " || ", as specified by the child node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Combine multiple SQL column names from [.fields] into a single string for use in a SELECT statement, separating them with " || ".
 * - Merge user-provided form field values from [.fields] into a single display string, using " || " as a visual delimiter.
 * - Prepare a concatenated log message containing several pieces of data from [.fields], using " || " to separate each part.
