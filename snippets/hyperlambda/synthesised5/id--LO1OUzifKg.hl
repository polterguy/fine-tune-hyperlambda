/*
 * 1. The [while] slot is used to repeatedly execute its child lambda as long as the provided condition is true.
 * 2. The [lt] slot checks if the value of [.attempts] is less than 3.
 * 3. [get-value] retrieves the current value of the [.attempts] node to be used in the comparison.
 * 4. Inside the loop, [log.info] logs an informational message indicating a task attempt.
 * 5. [math.increment] increases the [.attempts] value by 1 after each iteration, ensuring progress toward the loop's termination.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrying an operation up to a maximum number of times (e.g., retrying a failed HTTP request).
 * - Limiting the number of login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
 * - Repeating a task or process a specific number of times for testing or processing batches.
