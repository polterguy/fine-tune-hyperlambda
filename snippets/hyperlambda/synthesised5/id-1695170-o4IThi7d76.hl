/*
 * 1. The [crypto.random] slot generates a cryptographically secure random alphanumeric string.
 * 2. The [min] and [max] nodes both set the length of the random string to exactly 10 characters, by specifying the same value for minimum and maximum.
 * 3. Only characters from a-z, A-Z, and 0-9 will be included in the generated output.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Creating a secure, fixed-length temporary password for user registration.
 * - Generating a 10-character unique token for API authentication or session keys.
 * - Producing a short, unpredictable string for use as a verification code or one-time PIN.
 * - Assigning random identifiers to short-lived resources or objects in a system.
