/*
 * 1. The [math.multiply] slot multiplies its child arguments together. In this case, it multiplies the result of the [time] slot and the static integer value 18.
 * 2. The [time] slot creates a time span object representing 365 days, as specified by the [days] child node.
 * 3. The static value [. :int:18] is multiplied by the time span created by the [time] slot.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Calculating the total time span for 18 years by multiplying 365 days by 18, useful for age calculations or service durations.
 * - Determining the number of days in 18 years for licensing, subscriptions, or scheduling purposes.
 * - Generating a time offset to add or subtract from a specific date, such as setting an expiration date 18 years from now.
