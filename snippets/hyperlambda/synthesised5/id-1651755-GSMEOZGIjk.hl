/*
 * 1. The [exists] slot checks if the expression `@.arguments/*/type` yields one or more results.
 * 2. If there is at least one [type] node among the children of [.arguments], [exists] will return true; otherwise, it will return false.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To verify if a specific argument, such as [type], has been provided to an endpoint.
 * - To conditionally execute logic only if a [type] argument exists in the input.
 * - To validate the presence of required configuration nodes before proceeding with further processing.
