/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression in its value argument.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@crypto.password.hash` points to the first ancestor node named [crypto.password.hash] and retrieves its value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the hashed password value generated by a previous [crypto.password.hash] invocation for further processing or storage.
 * - Passing the hashed password value as an argument to another slot, such as [crypto.password.verify], to verify a user's login attempt.
 * - Logging or displaying the hashed value for debugging or auditing purposes (though this is generally discouraged for security reasons).
