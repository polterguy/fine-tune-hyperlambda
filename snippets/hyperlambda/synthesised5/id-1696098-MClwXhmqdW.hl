/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates a sequence of string values into one single string, using the nodes provided as its children.
 * 2. The first argument uses an expression `:x:@.sql` to retrieve all child nodes of [.sql] and includes their values in the concatenation.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.sql] fetches the value of the [.sql] node, ensuring it is added to the resulting string.
 * 4. The remaining nodes—[.:" from "], [.:notes], and [.:" where keyword_count > 0"]—add specific static strings and the value of a [notes] node to the concatenated result, effectively constructing a part of a SQL statement.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically building SQL query strings for database operations based on prior logic in [.sql].
 * - Generating customized log messages or reports that require combining static and dynamic string parts.
 * - Creating REST API endpoint URLs or request strings by assembling path and query parameters in a single operation.
 * - Combining user inputs and template fragments to render dynamic content for web applications.
