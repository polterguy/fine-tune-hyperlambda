/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot is used to ensure that the [task_id] argument exists within the [.arguments] node and is not null. If [task_id] is missing or its value is null, an exception will be thrown, halting further execution.
 * 
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/task_id` targets all [task_id] nodes found as children of any child node of [.arguments], allowing validation of multiple [task_id] arguments if present.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that a required [task_id] parameter is provided when invoking an endpoint that manipulates or queries tasks.
 * - Validating user input in an API endpoint to prevent accidental omission of critical identifiers.
 * - Enforcing data integrity before proceeding with task-related operations such as retrieval, update, or deletion.
