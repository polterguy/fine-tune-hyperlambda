/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks a composite condition and executes its [.lambda] child only if the condition is true.
 * 2. The [and] slot inside [if] takes two boolean literals, evaluating to true only if both are trueâ€”here, one is false, so the whole condition is false.
 * 3. The [.lambda] node contains a [set-value] that would update all sibling [.result] nodes to "ERROR", but this code block is skipped because the [and] evaluates to false.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating multiple flags before performing an update; if any flag is false, the update does not occur.
 * - Preventing error states from being set unless all preconditions are true.
 * - Guarding destructive actions with multiple checks, ensuring safety before proceeding.
 * - Asserting invariants in a workflow where all must be satisfied to continue.
