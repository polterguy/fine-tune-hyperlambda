/*
 * 1. [mssql.connect]: Establishes a connection to the [inventory] database, allowing subsequent slots to execute SQL operations within this connection context.
 * 2. [mssql.create]: Inserts a new record into the [products] table by specifying the column values for [name], [price], and [stock]. The values are safely parameterized to prevent SQL injection.
 * 3. [yield]: Returns a message to the caller indicating the product was inserted successfully, signaling the completion of the operation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Adding a new product to an inventory management system database.
 * - Automating the onboarding of new items in a retail application.
 * - Populating initial data for product catalogs during setup.
 * - Creating an administrative endpoint for product creation in an e-commerce backend.
