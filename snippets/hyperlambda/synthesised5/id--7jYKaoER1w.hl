/*
 * 1. [for-each]: Iterates over each child node of [new_hires] found under [.company], allowing the following logic to execute for every new hire listed.
 * 2. [unwrap]: Ensures that the context for the current iteration is expanded, so subsequent slots have access to the correct data for each new hire.
 * 3. [mail.smtp.send]: Sends an email for each new hire, constructing a personalized welcome message.
 * 4. [to]: Dynamically sets the recipientâ€™s name and email using the current iteration's [name] and [email] data.
 * 5. [cc], [bcc]: Adds additional recipients (HR Manager, HR Team as CC; System Archive as BCC) to each outgoing email.
 * 6. [subject], [entity], [content]: Composes a standard subject line and a plain text body welcoming the new hire, with directions for onboarding.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automating welcome emails for new employees as soon as they are added to the [.company]/[new_hires] node.
 * - Ensuring HR stakeholders and archives are always included in onboarding communications without manual intervention.
 * - Easily scaling to large onboarding batches by simply appending new hire details under [new_hires].
 * - Maintaining consistent messaging and record-keeping for compliance or audit purposes.
