/*
 * 1. The [mssql.connect] slot establishes a connection to the [appdb] database, making all child slots operate within this database context.
 * 2. The [mssql.create] slot inserts a new record into the [users] table, using the [values] node to specify [username], [email], and [is_active] fields for the new user.
 * 3. The [return-id] node is set to [bool:false], instructing [mssql.create] not to return the new record's ID after insertion.
 * 4. The [return] slot sends a response with a [message] node indicating a user was created, but the user's ID was not returned.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Adding a new user to a Microsoft SQL Server database without needing to know the generated user ID.
 * - Batch processing multiple user registrations where IDs are not immediately required.
 * - Populating a table with test data for system initialization.
 * - Integrating with external systems where only confirmation of creation is necessary, not the new record's identifier.
