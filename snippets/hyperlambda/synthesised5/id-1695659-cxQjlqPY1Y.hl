/*
 * 1. The [case] node named [case] with value "mssql" is used as a conditional branch, likely within a [switch] statement, to execute this block only when handling the "mssql" case.
 * 2. Each [remove-nodes] slot targets nodes matching the expression `:x:@signal/*/*/db/=master` (and similarly for tempdb, model, msdb), removing any [db] nodes under any child and grandchild of [signal] whose value matches one of the system database names.
 * 3. The use of multiple [remove-nodes] slots ensures that all references to the default SQL Server system databases are excluded from the node structure under [signal], which is typically done to prevent further operations on these reserved databases.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up a list of databases returned from SQL Server to exclude system databases before showing them to end users.
 * - Preparing a filtered node structure for subsequent logic that should only operate on user-created databases.
 * - Sanitizing input or output in automation scripts to avoid accidental modification or display of critical system databases.
