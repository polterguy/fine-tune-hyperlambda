/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node declares that this endpoint accepts a single argument named [file], which can be of any type or structure (due to the "*" wildcard).
 * 2. The [yield] slot is used to return a result from this HTTP endpoint.
 * 3. Inside [yield], a [filename] node is created by extracting the value of the [name] child node from within the [file] argument using the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/file/*/name`.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting and returning the filename from an uploaded file object passed as the [file] argument.
 * - Creating a generic endpoint that can process files with flexible or complex structures, since [file] accepts any type.
 * - Building a service that inspects payloads and responds with metadata (like filenames) from client uploads.
 * - Creating a simplified API for clients to verify the name property of a file object sent to the server.
