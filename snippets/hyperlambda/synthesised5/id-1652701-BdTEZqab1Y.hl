/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return data from a dynamic slot or endpoint. It marks the output that will be sent back to the caller.
 * 2. The [courses] node is created as a child of [yield], and its value is set to the result of the expression `:x:@data.read/*`, which retrieves all child nodes of [data.read].
 * 3. This pattern is commonly used to return a collection of items (such as a list of courses) from a data source in response to an API call or dynamic slot execution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a list of courses from a database or in-memory data structure in an API endpoint.
 * - Providing a standardized output format for a dynamic slot that fetches course data.
 * - Supplying course data to a frontend application by exposing it through an HTTP endpoint.
