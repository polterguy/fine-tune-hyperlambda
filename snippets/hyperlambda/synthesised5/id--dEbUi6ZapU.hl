/*
 * 1. The [if] slot is used to perform conditional branching based on the result of its child condition. It executes its [.lambda] block only if the condition is true.
 * 2. The [lt] slot checks if the value retrieved from the [.testResult] node is less than the static value 100.
 * 3. The [get-value] slot fetches the value from the [.testResult] node for comparison.
 * 4. The [set-value] slot assigns the string "Normal range" to the [.result] node if the condition is satisfied.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically categorize a numeric test result as "Normal range" if it falls below a defined upper threshold.
 * - Implement basic validation to flag or mark results based on conditional logic.
 * - Use in health or performance monitoring scenarios to provide simple text feedback when a value is within expected limits.
