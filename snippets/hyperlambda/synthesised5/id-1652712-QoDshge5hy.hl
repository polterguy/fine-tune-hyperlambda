/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return data from a dynamic slot or endpoint. It forwards evaluates its child expressions and returns the resulting nodes or values as the output of the slot.
 * 2. The [shipments] node is created as a child of [yield], and its value is set to the result of the expression `:x:@data.read/*`, which retrieves all child nodes of the [data.read] node.
 * 3. The effect is that the output will contain a [shipments] node holding all the nodes found under [data.read].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a list of shipment records read from a data source to an API client.
 * - Wrapping the results of a data read operation in a named node for further processing or serialization.
 * - Providing a consistent response structure for endpoints that deliver collections of items.
