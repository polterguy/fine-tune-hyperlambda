/*
 * 1. The [and] slot is used to group multiple conditions together, requiring all child conditions to evaluate as true for the entire [and] block to be true.
 * 2. The [notes.client_id:client_id.client_id] node represents a condition, typically used in SQL join "on" clauses, where the value of the [notes.client_id] column must be equal to the value of the [client_id.client_id] column.
 * 3. This construct is commonly nested under [on] inside a [join] when building complex SQL queries, ensuring that table relationships are properly defined.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Defining join conditions in a SQL query to relate rows from two tables based on matching client IDs.
 * - Building data.read queries with multiple constraints, where all conditions must be satisfied.
 * - Dynamically generating safe SQL join statements in pipelines that compose database access logic.
