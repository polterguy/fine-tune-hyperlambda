/*
 * 1. The [.result] node is prepared to store the outcome of the operation.
 * 2. A [.lambda] node is defined, which contains logic to set the value of [.result] to "Executed!" using the [set-value] slot.
 * 3. The [eval] slot is used with the expression `:x:@.lambda` to execute the logic inside the [.lambda] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically executing a block of logic and updating a result node based on the execution.
 * - Defining reusable lambda expressions and invoking them as needed.
 * - Implementing deferred execution where the actual logic is only run when explicitly triggered.
 * - Separating logic definition from execution for better modularity.
