/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@.sequence/*/second/-`.
 * 2. The expression starts by locating the [.sequence] node, then gets all its children, finds the [second] node, and then uses the `-` iterator to retrieve its previous sibling, which is the [first] node.
 * 3. As a result, [get-value] will return the value of the [first] node, which is "A".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Accessing the value of a sibling node that comes before a specific node in a sequence.
 * - Navigating structured lists where the order of nodes is significant and retrieving related values.
 * - Implementing logic that depends on the relationship between adjacent nodes in a data set, such as previous steps or states.
