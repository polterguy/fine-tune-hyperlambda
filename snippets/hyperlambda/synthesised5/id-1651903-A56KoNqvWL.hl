/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of all nodes named [module] that are descendants of the node referenced by the [@.lambda] expression. It sets their value to the value of the [module] node found under [.arguments].
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [module] node from under [.arguments], which is then used as the new value for the targeted [module] nodes.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically inject a module name argument into all [module] nodes within a lambda object before executing it.
 * - Update configuration or metadata nodes named [module] in a template with a user-supplied value.
 * - Prepare a lambda definition for invocation by ensuring all internal [module] references are set to the correct argument value.
