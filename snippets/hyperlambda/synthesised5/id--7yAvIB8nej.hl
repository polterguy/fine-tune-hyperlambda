/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks whether at least one of the following conditions is true: the value of [.disk-space] is less than 50, or the value of [.network] is false.
 * 2. The [or] slot combines both conditions so that if either one is true, the [if] branch is executed.
 * 3. The [lt] slot compares [.disk-space] to 50 to determine if disk space is below the threshold.
 * 4. The [eq] slot checks if [.network] is false, indicating no network connectivity.
 * 5. The [set-value] slot assigns a specific message to [.result] based on the outcome of the condition.
 * 6. The [else] slot provides an alternative action, setting a different value in [.result] if neither of the initial conditions are met.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - To determine whether to proceed with a backup operation based on available disk space or network status.
 * - To set user-facing messages in automation scenarios that depend on hardware resources or connectivity.
 * - As a validation step in a deployment pipeline, ensuring system prerequisites are satisfied before execution.
 * - To automate administrative checks and report status for scheduled tasks.
