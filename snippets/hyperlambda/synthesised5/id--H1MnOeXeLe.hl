/*
 * 1. The [.message] node stores the string "Hello, World!" as its value.
 * 2. The [crypto.hash] slot is invoked to generate a cryptographic hash of the data referenced by the `.message` node, using the lambda expression `:x:@.message`.
 * 3. The [algorithm] child node is set to "sha256", instructing [crypto.hash] to use the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Verifying the integrity of a message by generating a SHA-256 hash for future comparisons.
 * - Creating a unique identifier or digital fingerprint for the content of [.message].
 * - Securing sensitive data by storing or transmitting only its hash instead of the raw message.
 * - Preprocessing text for secure password storage or digital signature workflows.
