/*
 * 1. The [io.stream.open-file] slot is invoked with an expression as its value (`:x:@.filename-and-path`), which dynamically retrieves the file path from the [.filename-and-path] node.
 * 2. This slot opens the specified file and returns a raw stream object as the value of the [io.stream.open-file] node, rather than loading the file's content into memory.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - When you need to process large files without loading them entirely into memory, such as streaming a file over an HTTP response.
 * - When you want to pass an open file stream to another slot for further processing, like saving or reading from the stream.
 * - When working with file uploads or downloads where direct stream manipulation is required for efficiency.
