/*
 * 1. The [include] slot executes the child [data.read] node and includes its results in the current execution context.
 * 2. The [data.read] slot queries the [Book] table in the database, selecting the [BookId] and [Title] columns.
 * 3. The [where] clause filters results to only include books where the [PublisherId] matches the [PublisherId] value from the referenced node `:x:@.dp/#/*/PublisherId`.
 * 4. The [yield] slot returns the results of the [data.read] operation as a [books] node, containing all selected book records.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching all books for a specific publisher, where the publisher's ID is dynamically determined from another part of the execution context.
 * - Including related book data as part of a larger data retrieval process, such as when returning publisher details along with their books.
 * - Returning a filtered list of books in an API response, based on the publisher associated with the current operation.
