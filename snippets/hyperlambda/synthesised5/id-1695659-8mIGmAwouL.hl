/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot is used to delete all nodes that match the expression provided in its value.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@signal/*/*/db/=performance_schema` navigates from the [signal] node, selects all its children, then all their children, then specifically looks for [db] nodes whose value is exactly "performance_schema".
 * 3. Any nodes that meet this criteria will be removed from the execution tree or data structure.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up database metadata by removing nodes representing the "performance_schema" database.
 * - Filtering out unwanted system databases from a list before further processing.
 * - Preparing a sanitized node structure for user display by excluding technical or system-level databases.
 * - Preventing accidental operations on the "performance_schema" database by removing its reference from a dynamic list.
