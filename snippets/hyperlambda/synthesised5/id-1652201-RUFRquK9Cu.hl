/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal:northwind.Customers.put] slot sends a SignalR event with the method name "northwind.Customers.put" to connected clients.
 * 2. The [args] node is included as a child, indicating that any arguments to be sent to subscribers should be placed here and will be serialized to JSON and transmitted with the signal.
 * 3. No [roles], [users], [clients], or [groups] nodes are specified, so the signal will be broadcast to all subscribers of the "northwind.Customers.put" event.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Notifying all connected clients in real time when a customer record is updated in the Northwind database.
 * - Broadcasting changes to customer data to all users of an admin dashboard so their views stay in sync.
 * - Triggering UI updates in client applications whenever customer information is modified server-side.
