/*
 * 1. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all child nodes of the [csv2lambda] node, using the expression `:x:@csv2lambda/*`.
 * 2. The `@csv2lambda` part of the expression locates the first node named [csv2lambda] in the current execution context.
 * 3. The `/*` iterator collects all immediate children of the located [csv2lambda] node and returns them as a node set.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting all data rows that were converted from a CSV string back into lambda format for further processing.
 * - Passing the resulting nodes into another slot or loop for additional transformations or validations.
 * - Aggregating or displaying the contents produced by the [csv2lambda] conversion without including the [csv2lambda] wrapper node itself.
