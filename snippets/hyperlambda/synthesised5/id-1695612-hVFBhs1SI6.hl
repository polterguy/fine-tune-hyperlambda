/*
 * 1. The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks if the currently authenticated user is authorized to perform the action by confirming their presence in one or more required roles. If no roles are specified as a value, it only verifies that a valid JWT token exists and that the user is logged in. If the verification fails, it raises an exception and stops further execution.
 * 
 * 2. This slot is crucial for controlling access to endpoints or code blocks where authentication is required, ensuring only users with valid tokens (and, if specified, appropriate roles) can proceed.
 * 
 * 3. Common uses:
 *    - Restricting access to sensitive API endpoints so only authenticated users (optionally with certain roles) can invoke them.
 *    - Enforcing role-based permissions by specifying role names as a comma-separated list, e.g., `auth.ticket.verify:admin,moderator`.
 *    - Asserting that a user is logged in before proceeding with business logic in a workflow or automation that depends on user identity.
 *    - Preventing unauthorized access to administrative dashboard features or critical operations.
