/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@.fields`. It looks for the first node named [.fields] in the current context and returns its value.
 * 
 * 2. This operation is useful for extracting the actual data stored inside the [.fields] node, rather than the node itself or its children.
 * 
 * 3. Since [get-value] returns the value directly, it is often used when you need to use or compare the content of [.fields] in further logic or calculations.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Obtaining user input or form data stored in a [.fields] node for validation.
 * - Fetching configuration settings or parameters from [.fields] to drive business logic.
 * - Passing the value of [.fields] to another slot or function for processing or display.
