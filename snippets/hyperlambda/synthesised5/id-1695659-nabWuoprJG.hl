/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to append nodes to the result set specified by its expression. Here, the expression is deeply nested, traversing through multiple [for-each] nodes and referencing the [.dp] node by reference, then further navigating to the first child under [tables], then moving to the previous sibling, accessing all its children, and finally targeting the [indexes] node.
 * 2. The two dot nodes ([.]) are added as children under the targeted [indexes] nodes for each resolved path, serving as placeholders or empty nodes.
 * 3. This construct relies on the for-each context and makes use of node referencing and navigation to dynamically add nodes in a complex, deeply nested data structure.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically append empty nodes or placeholders to all [indexes] nodes found within a deeply nested collection for later population.
 * - Prepare or initialize index nodes before populating them with data after complex data extraction or transformation.
 * - Facilitate recursive or repeated operations over hierarchical data structures, such as auto-generating index entries for multiple table definitions in a schema.
