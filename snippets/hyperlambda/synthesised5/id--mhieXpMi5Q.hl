/*
 * 1. The [exists] slot is used to determine if the expression `:x:@.empty/*` yields one or more nodes. In this case, since [.empty] has no children, [exists:x:@.empty/*] will evaluate to false.
 * 2. The second [exists] invocation explicitly sets its value to boolean false, which demonstrates that [exists] can also be used as a static boolean node, not just as a slot.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Checking if a data segment such as [.empty] actually contains any child nodes before performing further operations.
 * - Conditionally executing logic only when a node is not empty.
 * - Verifying the presence of configuration or data subsections before processing.
