/*
 * 1. The [execute-file] slot is used to run the Hyperlambda file located at "/modules/hr/check-retirement.hl", effectively invoking it as if it were a dynamic slot.
 * 2. The code passes two arguments to the Hyperlambda file being executed: [name] with the value "David Thompson" and [age] with the integer value 64, provided as children of the [execute-file] node.
 * 3. The executed file can then access these arguments via its [.arguments] node, enabling it to perform logic such as evaluating retirement status or eligibility based on the provided [name] and [age].
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Checking if an employee named David Thompson, age 64, meets criteria for retirement within an HR workflow.
 * - Dynamically executing business logic stored in Hyperlambda files with user-supplied parameters.
 * - Integrating custom eligibility checks or data processing modules in a modular enterprise application by parameterizing execution context.
