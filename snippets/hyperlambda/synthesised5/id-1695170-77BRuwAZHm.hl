/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot is used to enforce that the [limit] argument exists within each child node of [.arguments]. If any [limit] node is missing, the slot throws an exception, preventing further execution.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/limit` targets all [limit] nodes nested under any direct child of [.arguments], allowing the validator to simultaneously check multiple argument groups.
 * 3. This validation step is typically executed at the start of endpoint logic to ensure required parameters are present before any processing occurs, providing early feedback on missing input.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Ensuring a [limit] parameter is supplied for pagination or query size restrictions in API endpoints.
 * - Validating that batch operations receive a [limit] property per batch item in a bulk request.
 * - Preventing execution of business logic if clients omit the [limit] argument in their payload structure.
