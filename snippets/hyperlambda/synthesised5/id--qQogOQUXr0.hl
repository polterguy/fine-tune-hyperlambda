/*
 * 1. The [http.patch] slot sends an HTTP PATCH request to the URL "https://api.example.com/items/123".
 * 2. The [headers] node is used to include custom HTTP headers with the request, specifically setting [Content-Type] to "application/json" and [X-API-Key] to "MY_API_KEY_ABC123".
 * 3. The [query] node appends query parameters to the URL, in this case adding "ID=5" to the request.
 * 4. The [payload] node provides the request body, sending the JSON string "{\"price\": 25.00}" as the PATCH payload to update the item's price.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Updating the price of a specific item in a remote inventory system via an authenticated API call.
 * - Sending partial updates to a RESTful resource with custom headers and query parameters.
 * - Integrating with third-party APIs that require both authentication keys and specific content types for PATCH operations.
 * - Automating inventory management tasks where item attributes need to be updated without replacing the entire resource.
