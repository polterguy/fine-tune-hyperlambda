/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of a node specified by its expression. In this case, the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/offset` is used to locate the [offset] node within the [arguments] node's children and return its value.
 * 2. The [get-value] slot is often used to extract a parameter or argument value dynamically from input data, configuration, or function arguments, allowing for flexible value retrieval.
 * 3. The usage of `@.arguments/*/offset` ensures that only the first [offset] node found among the children of [arguments] is targeted, which helps in scenarios where argument names might be dynamic or nested.
 * 
 * Typical use cases:
 * - Reading a pagination offset parameter from HTTP request arguments in API endpoints.
 * - Accessing configuration values provided as arguments to dynamic slots or functions.
 * - Extracting user input or settings that may control further logic or calculations in a workflow.
