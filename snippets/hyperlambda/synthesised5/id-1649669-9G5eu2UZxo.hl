/*
 * 1. The [switch] slot evaluates the value of the [http.get] node and branches execution based on its value.
 * 2. The [case] slots handle specific HTTP status codes:
 *    - [case:int:200]: If the status code is 200, it sets the value of [.profile.result] to the value of the [name] node found in the content of the [http.get] response.
 *    - [case:int:401]: If the status code is 401, it throws an exception with the message "401 Unauthorized – Invalid or missing token".
 *    - [case:int:404]: If the status code is 404, it throws an exception with the message "404 Not Found – User profile endpoint does not exist".
 * 3. The [default] slot handles any other status code by setting the value of [.profile.result] to "Unexpected error occurred".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Handling different HTTP response codes after attempting to fetch a user profile, providing clear error messages or extracting profile data as appropriate.
 * - Returning a specific error to the client if authentication fails or the endpoint is missing.
 * - Ensuring that unexpected errors are caught and reported in a user-friendly way.
