/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot checks if the node(s) matching the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/vector_model` exist and have a non-null value. If any are missing or null, it throws an exception, halting further execution.
 * 2. The expression targets all [vector_model] nodes that are children of any node under [.arguments], ensuring that this argument is always provided for each relevant input structure.
 * 3. This validator is typically used at the start of a process to enforce that required parameters are supplied before performing further logic, helping maintain input integrity.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Enforcing that every incoming API request payload includes a [vector_model] parameter before processing a machine learning operation.
 * - Validating user input in a form where the selection of a vector model is mandatory, preventing incomplete submissions.
 * - Checking configuration files to ensure that all expected vector model entries are defined before initializing a service.
 * - Safeguarding workflows that depend on the presence of a [vector_model] argument to avoid runtime errors due to missing data.
