/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot is used to ensure that a required argument is present and not null.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/fkName` targets all [fkName] nodes that are children of any node under [.arguments].
 * 3. If any targeted [fkName] node does not exist or has a null value, the slot throws an exception, preventing further execution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Enforcing that a foreign key name ([fkName]) is always provided in an API endpoint's input arguments.
 * - Validating that a required field is present before processing data in a workflow.
 * - Ensuring critical configuration values are not missing during initialization.
