/*
 * 1. [validators.mandatory] checks if the [.arguments] node contains a [release] child node, ensuring the required argument is present; otherwise, it throws an exception.
 * 2. [.file] is a data node used to store information temporarily.
 * 3. [set-value] updates the value of the [.file] node with the result of [strings.concat], which concatenates "/etc/releases/" with the value of the [release] argument from [.arguments].
 * 4. [response.headers.set] configures HTTP response headers to indicate the content is an octet-stream and sets the content disposition to attachment with the filename "release.zip".
 * 5. [io.stream.open-file] opens the file at the path specified in [.file] as a stream, preparing it for download or further processing.
 * 6. [return] returns the opened file stream as the HTTP response.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Downloading a specific release ZIP file by specifying its name as a parameter in an HTTP request.
 * - Serving dynamically determined binary files for authenticated users via an API.
 * - Enforcing mandatory parameters for file download endpoints to ensure required information is supplied.
 * - Setting precise HTTP response headers to instruct browsers to treat the response as a file attachment.
 * - Streaming large files directly from disk to the client without loading the entire file into memory.
