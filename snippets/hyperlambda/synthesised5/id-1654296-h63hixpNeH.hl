/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return data from a dynamic slot or endpoint. It finalizes the execution and outputs the specified nodes or values.
 * 2. The [courses] node is created as a child of [yield], and its value is set to the result of the expression `:x:@data.read/*`, which retrieves all child nodes of the [data.read] node.
 * 3. This pattern is typically used to return a collection of items (in this case, courses) from a data source, making the data available to the caller of the slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a list of courses from a database or data source in an API endpoint.
 * - Providing a collection of items to a frontend application for display.
 * - Supplying the result of a data query to another slot or process for further manipulation.
