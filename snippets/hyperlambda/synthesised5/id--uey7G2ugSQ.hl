/*
 * 1. The [io.file.load] slot is used to load the contents of the file located at "/data/report.txt" as a text string. If the file exists, its entire content will be returned as the value of the [io.file.load] node.
 * 2. This slot is strictly for reading text files, and will not work correctly with binary files.
 * 3. If the specified file does not exist, the slot will typically throw an exception or return an error, depending on the framework's error handling.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Reading a configuration file (such as a .txt or .json) for use within a workflow.
 * - Importing plain text data, such as logs or reports, to process or analyze further in Hyperlambda.
 * - Loading the content of a documentation file to display or return as part of an API endpoint.
