/*
 * 1. The [insert-after] slot is used to insert new nodes immediately after the node(s) referenced by its expression argument. In this case, it locates the [chapter1] node within the [.book] node and inserts additional content after it.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.book/*/chapter1` finds the [chapter1] node inside [.book], serving as the insertion point for the new content.
 * 3. The node to be inserted is declared as a child of [insert-after] and, in this example, is a node named [chapter2] with the value "Next book chapter".
 * 4. The result is that [.book] will contain [chapter1] followed by [chapter2], with [chapter2] appearing immediately after [chapter1].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically adding a new chapter to a book structure after a specific chapter node.
 * - Inserting additional items into an ordered list, placing them directly after a known item.
 * - Modifying hierarchical data structures by programmatically updating the sequence of elements.
 * - Building document outlines where new sections must follow existing ones in a specific order.
