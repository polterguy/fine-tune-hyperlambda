/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot targets all [keyword_density] nodes that are children of any node within the second level of the [data.select] hierarchy and removes them from the tree.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@data.select/*/*/keyword_density` ensures that only nodes named [keyword_density] located two levels deep under [data.select] are affected, leaving other nodes intact.
 * 3. This operation is non-reversible and will permanently delete all matched [keyword_density] nodes from the current execution context.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up intermediate [keyword_density] data after performing text analysis on database query results.
 * - Removing sensitive or unnecessary keyword density information before serializing or exporting [data.select] results.
 * - Simplifying data structures by eliminating detailed keyword analysis nodes before further processing or reporting.
