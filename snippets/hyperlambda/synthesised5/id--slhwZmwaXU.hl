/*
 * 1. [pgsql.connect] - Establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database named "audit", making subsequent database operations execute in the context of this connection.
 * 2. [pgsql.execute] - Runs the provided raw SQL statement, which deletes all records from the "logs" table where the "created_at" timestamp is older than 90 days from the current time.
 * 3. [yield] - Returns a response node named [message] with a confirmation that old logs have been deleted.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automated cleanup of log data in an audit database to comply with data retention policies.
 * - Scheduled maintenance tasks that purge outdated records to optimize storage and improve query performance.
 * - Ensuring that log tables do not grow indefinitely, preventing potential slowdowns due to excessive data.
