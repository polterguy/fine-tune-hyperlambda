/*
 * 1. The [strings.replace-not-of] slot is used to process the string found in the [.phrase] node, which in this case is "Hello, World!". It examines each character and replaces any character not found in the allowed set (provided as the first argument, which includes all uppercase and lowercase letters as well as a space) with the value of the second argument (which is an empty string here).
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.phrase` supplies the value of the [.phrase] node ("Hello, World!") as the input string to [strings.replace-not-of].
 * 3. The first argument is a string of all uppercase and lowercase English letters plus a space, indicating which characters are allowed to remain.
 * 4. The second argument is an empty string, so any character not in the allowed set (such as "," and "!") will be removed from the input.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up user input by removing punctuation or special characters, leaving only alphabetic characters and spaces.
 * - Preparing strings for comparison or search operations by stripping out unwanted symbols.
 * - Sanitizing data for display or processing where only letters and spaces are permitted.
 * - Generating simple "slug" or "label" values from phrases by removing all non-letter characters.
