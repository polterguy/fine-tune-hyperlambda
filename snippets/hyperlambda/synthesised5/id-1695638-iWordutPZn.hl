/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate multiple string values and expressions into a single string. This slot processes all its child nodes, joining their values in the order they appear.
 * 2. The first child node of [strings.concat] is a static string containing part of a SQL query, specifically the initial SELECT and JOIN clauses, along with a WHERE condition that checks for `ts.type = @type`.
 * 3. The [get-value:x:@.prefix-url] slot retrieves the value of the [.prefix-url] node from the current lambda context and inserts it into the concatenated string at this position.
 * 4. The final child node is another static string with additional SQL, including a vector search function, a distance filter, group by, order by, and limit clauses.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically constructing a SQL query string by combining static SQL with a runtime URL prefix value stored in [.prefix-url].
 * - Generating complex SQL statements for machine learning or search operations where part of the query depends on configuration or input parameters.
 * - Building queries for systems that use vector similarity search and need to filter and group results based on dynamic embedding or distance thresholds.
