/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot is used to update the value of the [.config] node (referenced by `-`) to a new value.
 * 2. The [config.get] slot retrieves a configuration value using the path "foo:bar" from the application's configuration settings. The value obtained (always as a string) from this key will be used as the new value for [.config].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically loading a setting from configuration and assigning it to a node for later use in logic.
 * - Fetching credentials or tokens from configuration and storing them in a temporary location for processing.
 * - Implementing feature toggles by reading configuration flags and applying them to decision points.
 * - Centralizing application behavior by making code logic dependent on external configuration values.
