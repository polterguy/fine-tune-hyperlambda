/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it will look for the first node named [.fields] in the current context and return its value.
 * 2. The expression uses the `@` iterator, so it searches for the first ancestor or sibling node named [.fields] relative to where the [get-value] is executed.
 * 3. This slot does not modify the node, it simply extracts its value for use in further processing or as an output.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving submitted form field values from a [.fields] node in an HTTP endpoint.
 * - Accessing configuration or settings data stored in a [.fields] node higher up in the execution tree.
 * - Passing the value of [.fields] as an argument to another slot or function for validation or computation.
