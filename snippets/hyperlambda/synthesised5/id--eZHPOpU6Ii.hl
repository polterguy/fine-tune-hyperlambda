/*
 * 1. [auth.ticket.verify] ensures that only users with the "root" role can execute the subsequent code, enforcing strict access control for this logic.
 * 2. [endpoints.list] gathers metadata about all available HTTP endpoints, such as their URLs, supported HTTP verbs, argument definitions, and descriptions.
 * 3. [return-nodes] returns the list of endpoint metadata nodes from the result of [endpoints.list] to the caller, making this data available as the HTTP response.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Building a secured admin dashboard that lists all API endpoints for system administrators.
 * - Automating API documentation generation for users with appropriate access rights.
 * - Providing endpoint discovery and introspection features within secure internal tooling.
 * - Restricting endpoint metadata access to only the most privileged users in a system.
