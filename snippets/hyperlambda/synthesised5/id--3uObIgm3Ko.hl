/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot is used to initiate a database connection to the [CustomerDB] database.
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies that the connection should use a PostgreSQL (pgsql) database adapter.
 * 3. The [data.read] slot is used to read data from the connected database, targeting the [customer] table.
 * 4. The [limit] node restricts the number of rows returned from the [customer] table to 5 records.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the first 5 customer records from a PostgreSQL database for display in a dashboard.
 * - Testing or previewing a small set of data from the [customer] table without retrieving the entire dataset.
 * - Validating database connectivity and table structure after deployment.
 * - Quickly sampling customer information for analytics or reporting purposes.
