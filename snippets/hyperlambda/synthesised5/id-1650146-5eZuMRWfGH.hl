/*
 * 1. The [math.subtract] slot subtracts two values: the current date and time (from [date.now]) and the value of the [birth_date] node found at the path `@data.read/*/*/birth_date`.
 * 2. The [date.now] slot returns the current UTC date and time.
 * 3. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [birth_date] node from the specified path.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Calculate a person's age or the time elapsed since a specific birth date.
 * - Determine the difference between the current date and a stored date for reporting or validation.
 * - Compute the duration between now and a historical event stored in the [birth_date] node.
