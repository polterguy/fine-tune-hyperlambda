/*
 * 1. The [http.get] slot performs an HTTP GET request to "https://api.example.com/items".
 * 2. The [query] node is used to add query string parameters (`category=books` and `limit=10`) to the request URL.
 * 3. The [convert] node is set to boolean true, so the response body will be automatically parsed and converted into a lambda object (for example, if the server returns JSON, the result will be a structured set of nodes).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching a list of books from a REST API with a limit on the number of results and working directly with the structured response data in Hyperlambda.
 * - Consuming a paginated or filtered dataset from a remote service and processing the response programmatically.
 * - Rapid prototyping of integrations that require easy conversion of API responses to lambda objects for further manipulation or storage.
