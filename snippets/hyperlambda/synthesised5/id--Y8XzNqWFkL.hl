/*
 * 1. The [compose] slot is used to dynamically build a lambda expression from its child nodes, each of which specifies a segment of the final expression. In this example, the resulting expression will be `@data.read/*/[0,1]`. 
 * 2. The `.:@data.read` node indicates that the composed expression should start by selecting the first ancestor node named [data.read].
 * 3. The `.:*` node appends an iterator to select all children of the previously selected node.
 * 4. The `.:[0,1]` node further refines the selection by including only the first node in the resulting set.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically constructing node selection expressions for use in other slots, such as [get-nodes] or [set-value].
 * - Creating flexible data extraction paths at runtime based on user input or configuration.
 * - Programmatically generating expressions for iterating over specific nodes in a hierarchy, such as retrieving the first child of a particular ancestor node.
