/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot deletes all nodes that match the result of the expression provided as its value.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@data.select/*/*/keyword_count` navigates to all [keyword_count] nodes that are children of any node, which itself is a child of any node inside the [data.select] node.
 * 3. As a result, every [keyword_count] node found at this hierarchical level beneath [data.select] will be permanently removed from the structure.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up temporary or auxiliary nodes like [keyword_count] from query results before returning or further processing the data.
 * - Sanitizing the output of a database selection to exclude statistical or sensitive fields.
 * - Resetting or preparing a node tree by stripping computed values before reusing the data in another operation.
 * - Ensuring that exported or serialized data does not contain certain calculated properties.
