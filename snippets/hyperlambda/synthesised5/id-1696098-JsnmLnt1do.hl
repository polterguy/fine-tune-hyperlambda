/*
 * 1. The [strings.join] slot concatenates the values of all nodes returned by the expression `:x:@.fields/*`, inserting " || " between each value.  
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.fields/*` selects all child nodes of the [.fields] node, so their values are joined together in order.
 * 3. The child node with value " || " defines the separator that will be placed between each concatenated string from the nodes selected.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Useful for dynamically building SQL SELECT statements where multiple fields need to be joined with a specific separator (e.g., for concatenated display or full-text search).
 * - Can be used for generating CSV or other delimited text representations from lists of string values.
 * - Helpful in formatting lists of names, tags, or other items with a custom separator for output or logging purposes.
 * - Enables flexible runtime string construction based on variable node content in the lambda graph.
