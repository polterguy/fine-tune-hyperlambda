/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node defines the expected input parameters for the logic, specifically a [username] and a [password], both as strings.
 * 2. [validators.mandatory] is invoked twice to ensure that both [.arguments/username] and [.arguments/password] are provided; if either is missing, an exception is thrown to prevent further execution.
 * 3. [execute] calls the [magic.auth.authenticate] slot, passing the values of [.arguments/username] and [.arguments/password] as arguments, which handles the actual authentication process.
 * 4. [yield] returns the [ticket] node, which is extracted from the result of the [execute] operation (specifically from the [ticket] node in the response of the authentication), making it the output of this logic.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Authenticating a user and returning a JWT token as part of a login HTTP endpoint.
 * - Asserting that required credentials are present before attempting authentication.
 * - Integrating with custom authentication flows that need to return a token to the client after verifying user credentials.
 * - Validating input for security to ensure no blank credentials are processed.
