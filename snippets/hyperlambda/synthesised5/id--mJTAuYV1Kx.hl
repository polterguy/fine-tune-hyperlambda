/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node declares that the endpoint accepts a single argument named [file] of type string, which will be used to specify the path of the file to load.
 * 2. The [auth.ticket.verify] slot is used to ensure that the caller is authenticated with "root" privileges before allowing further execution.
 * 3. The [load-file] slot loads the content of the file specified by the value of the [file] argument.
 * 4. The [hyper2lambda] slot parses the loaded Hyperlambda text content into an executable lambda object.
 * 5. The [add] slot appends the argument list from the loaded and parsed Hyperlambda file into the [return] node of the current execution context.
 * 6. The final [return] slot returns the result to the caller.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating and inspecting what arguments a Hyperlambda file expects, by loading and parsing its [.arguments] section.
 * - Providing an admin tool to check the input requirements of dynamically stored Hyperlambda endpoint files.
 * - Enforcing security by only allowing users with root privileges to perform file introspection.
 * - Automating documentation generation by extracting argument information from multiple Hyperlambda files.
 * - Supporting code analysis and migration tools that need to enumerate input parameters for endpoint files.
