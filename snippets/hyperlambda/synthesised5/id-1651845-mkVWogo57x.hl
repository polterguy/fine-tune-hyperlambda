/*
 * 1. The [type] slot is used to specify or retrieve the type information of a node's value in Hyperlambda.
 * 2. When invoked as a child node with a value (e.g., [type:string]), it sets or checks the type to "string".
 * 3. This slot is commonly used in combination with other slots like [convert] to ensure type safety or to perform type conversions.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating that a node's value is of type string before processing it further.
 * - Converting a value to a string type using [convert] and specifying [type:string] as the target type.
 * - Ensuring arguments passed to a dynamic slot are of the correct type by checking their type with [type].
