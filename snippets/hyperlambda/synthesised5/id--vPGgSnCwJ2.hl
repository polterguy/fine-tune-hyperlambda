/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates over all nodes named [setting] that are children of [.config], executing its child lambda for each node.
 * 2. Inside the loop, [set-value] changes the value of the referenced [setting] node (via [.dp]) to "reset".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Resetting the value of all [setting] nodes under [.config] to a default.
 * - Applying a batch update to multiple configuration properties at once.
 * - Normalizing or clearing specific configuration fields in preparation for new data.
 * - Ensuring all settings under a particular parent node have the same initial value.
