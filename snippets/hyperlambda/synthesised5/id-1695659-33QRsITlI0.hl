/*
 * 1. The [add] slot appends nodes to multiple destination nodes referenced by the `:x:+/*/*` expression, which targets all grandchildren of the current node's next sibling.
 * 2. [get-nodes] retrieves all children nodes of the node referenced by [.dp], where [.dp] is expected to be a reference (typically provided in a [for-each] or similar iterative context).
 * 3. The result of [get-nodes] is used as the source nodes to add under each destination node matched by the [add] expression.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Merging the child nodes of a currently iterated node into all grandchildren of the next sibling node in a data structure.
 * - Copying content from one part of the graph object into multiple target locations simultaneously.
 * - Performing batch updates or insertions where the same set of nodes needs to be added to several destinations dynamically determined during iteration.
