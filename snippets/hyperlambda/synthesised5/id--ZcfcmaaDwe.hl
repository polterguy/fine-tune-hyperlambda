/*
 * 1. The [response.status.set] slot sets the HTTP response status code to 200, indicating a successful operation.
 * 2. The [yield] slot returns a result object to the client, containing a [message] node with the value "Record deleted" and an [id] node, which dynamically retrieves the value of the [id] argument from the incoming request using the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/id`.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Sending a confirmation to an API client after deleting a database record, including the record's ID.
 * - Returning a standardized success message and the relevant identifier after removing a resource via an HTTP DELETE endpoint.
 * - Providing feedback in RESTful services to clients when a deletion has occurred, supporting client-side validation or UI updates.
 * - Ensuring clients know exactly which resource was deleted by echoing the [id] in the response payload.
