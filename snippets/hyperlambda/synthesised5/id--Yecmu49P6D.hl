/*
 * 1. The [.dynamic-key] node is being set using an expression as its value.
 * 2. The expression `:x:"@.settings/*/\"{@.arguments/*/key}\""` dynamically constructs a path to retrieve a node from [.settings], where the child node's name is determined by the value of [.key] inside [.arguments].
 * 3. This approach allows you to fetch a specific child node from [.settings] based on a key provided at runtime.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving configuration values using a variable key supplied as an argument.
 * - Accessing user-specific or environment-specific settings where the key is determined dynamically.
 * - Implementing a lookup mechanism where the requested key is not known until execution time.
 * - Dynamically mapping user input to configuration nodes for flexible API endpoints.
