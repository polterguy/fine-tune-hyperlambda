/*
 * 1. [set-value] assigns a value to the [.result] node. It takes its source value from the next slot.
 * 2. [get-value] retrieves the value of a node located by an expression that dynamically uses the values of [.arg1] and [.arg2] to find the correct node inside a data structure.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically retrieve and store a specific value from a data set using variable keys, such as selecting a username from a list based on user input.
 * - Implement a lookup mechanism where both the data source and the item to retrieve can be configured at runtime.
 * - Assign the value of a specific database field to a result node based on parameters, useful in form processing or conditional logic.
