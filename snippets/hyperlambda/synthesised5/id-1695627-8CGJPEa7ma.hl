/*
 * 1. The [mt] slot compares its two child arguments and evaluates to true if the first argument is greater than the second.
 * 2. [get-count] is used as the first argument to [mt], and it counts the number of child nodes under the node at path `@csv2lambda/0`.
 * 3. The second argument to [mt] is an integer node with the value 1.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - To check if the first record produced by [csv2lambda] contains more than one child field after parsing a CSV.
 * - To validate that a data import from CSV has more than one attribute per record.
 * - To ensure that the structure of parsed CSV data is not empty or degenerate for downstream processing.
 * - To implement a conditional branch that only executes if a minimum number of columns is present in the data.
