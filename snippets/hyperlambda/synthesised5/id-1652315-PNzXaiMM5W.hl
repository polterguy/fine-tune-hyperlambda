/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to broadcast a message or event named [crm.documents.post] to connected SignalR clients.
 * 2. The [roles] node specifies that only users with the "admin" or "root" roles will receive this signal.
 * 3. The [args] node is present but empty, meaning no additional arguments or data are sent with the signal.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Notifying all administrators and root users in real-time when a new document is posted in a CRM system.
 * - Triggering UI updates for privileged users when document-related actions occur.
 * - Broadcasting workflow events to backend services or dashboards that listen for document changes, but restricting notifications to high-privilege roles.
