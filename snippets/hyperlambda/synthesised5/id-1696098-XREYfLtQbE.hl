/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot deletes all nodes matching the expression `:x:@data.select/*/*/keyword_density`. This means it will traverse all children under [data.select], then all their children, and remove any node named [keyword_density] found at that level.
 * 2. The `@data.select/*/*/keyword_density` expression ensures that only [keyword_density] nodes nested two levels below [data.select] are targeted for removal, leaving other nodes or [keyword_density] nodes elsewhere unaffected.
 * 3. This operation is useful for cleaning up unwanted or sensitive data from a complex result set, especially when working with outputs from SQL queries or document analysis tasks where [keyword_density] is a calculated or intermediate value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Removing auxiliary [keyword_density] results after text analysis, keeping only primary result nodes for further processing or output.
 * - Cleaning up nested data structures before exporting or serializing data, ensuring irrelevant or sensitive analysis metrics are not included.
 * - Preparing a dataset for machine learning or reporting by stripping out computed metrics that should not be part of the final dataset.
 * - Sanitizing API responses to clients by removing internal-use-only fields from hierarchical data.
