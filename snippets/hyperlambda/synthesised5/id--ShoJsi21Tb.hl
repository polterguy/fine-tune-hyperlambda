/*
 * 1. The [.src] node is initialized with the value 5.
 * 2. The [convert] slot is used to convert the value of the previous sibling node (referenced by `x:-`, which targets [.src]) to a new type.
 * 3. The [type] child node under [convert] specifies that the value should be converted to the "float" type.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically converting an integer input to a floating-point number for calculations that require decimal precision.
 * - Preparing data for storage or transmission where a specific numeric type is required.
 * - Ensuring compatibility with APIs or functions that expect float values rather than integers.
 * - Normalizing types before performing arithmetic operations involving mixed numeric types.
