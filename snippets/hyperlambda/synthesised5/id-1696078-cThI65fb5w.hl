/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot is used to retrieve the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/offset`. This expression navigates to the [offset] node within the [arguments] node and returns its value.
 * 2. The most important aspect of this code is its use of a lambda expression to dynamically access input arguments, allowing the retrieval of the [offset] parameter provided to a lambda or endpoint.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching a pagination offset value passed as an argument to an HTTP endpoint.
 * - Accessing user-specified configuration values inside a dynamic slot or custom business logic.
 * - Reusing the [offset] value in subsequent operations, such as querying a database with limit/offset functionality.
 * - Implementing logic that requires conditional branching or validation based on the presence or value of [offset].
