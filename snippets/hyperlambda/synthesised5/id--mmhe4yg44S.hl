/*
 * 1. The [parametrized] slot is used here to dynamically construct an expression based on values found in the [args] node, allowing for flexible referencing of nodes in [data] depending on the value of the [key] argument.
 * 2. The value for [parametrized] uses interpolation: it builds a lambda expression string that targets a child of [data] whose name matches the value of [key] inside [args].
 * 3. The `@.data/*/\"{@.args/*/key}\"` syntax ensures that the resulting expression will look for a node under [data] with a name exactly matching the value of [key], making the lookup adaptable at runtime.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically fetching configuration or settings nodes based on user input or runtime parameters.
 * - Creating flexible data retrieval logic for endpoints where the specific node to access is determined by an incoming argument.
 * - Implementing generic CRUD operations where the target node's name is not hardcoded but provided as a parameter.
 * - Building reusable Hyperlambda modules that operate on various nodes without modifying their internal logic.
