/*
 * 1. The [mssql.connect] slot establishes a connection to the "crm" SQL Server database, providing a context for subsequent database operations.
 * 2. The [mssql.create] slot constructs an SQL "INSERT" statement to add a new record into the [customers] table, using the child [values] node to set the [first_name] field to "John" and the [last_name] field to "Doe". Input values are parameterized to prevent SQL injection.
 * 3. The [yield] slot returns a response node with a [message] indicating that the customer has been created, signaling the successful completion of the operation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating a new customer entry in a CRM system when a user submits a registration form.
 * - Automating test data insertion into the [customers] table for integration tests.
 * - Providing an API endpoint that adds new customers and confirms the operation with a response message.
