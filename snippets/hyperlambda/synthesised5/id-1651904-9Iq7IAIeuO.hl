 * 1. The [return] slot is used to return a value from the current execution context, such as from an HTTP endpoint or a dynamic slot.
 * 2. The [sql] slot is referenced using the expression `:x:@.sql`, which means it will evaluate and return the value of the [.sql] node from the current lambda object.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning the generated SQL statement (from a previous [sql.*] slot) as the result of an endpoint for debugging or inspection.
 * - Providing the generated SQL to a client application for review before execution.
 * - Exposing the SQL generation process in a learning or testing scenario without executing it against a database.
