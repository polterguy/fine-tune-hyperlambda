/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot is used here to retrieve the value of the node named [.sql] within the current execution context. The expression `:x:@.sql` specifically points to the first node named [.sql] at the current level or up the hierarchy.
 * 2. This slot does not evaluate the children of the [.sql] node; it returns only its value, which could be a string, number, or any typed value directly assigned to [.sql].
 * 3. [get-value] is typically used in scenarios where you need to extract data from a node for further use, such as passing it as a parameter to another slot or composing dynamic output.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving a dynamically generated SQL query string from a [.sql] node for execution or logging.
 * - Extracting a configuration value stored in the graph for conditional branching or further processing.
 * - Accessing user input or calculated results stored in a specific node for validation or output purposes.
