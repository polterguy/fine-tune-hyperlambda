/*
 * 1. The [io.file.list] slot is used to list all files within the folder specified by its value, in this case the [/etc/system/openai/css/search/] folder.
 * 2. Only files (not folders) inside the specified directory will be returned.
 * 3. By default, hidden files will not be included in the result unless a [display-hidden] child node is provided and set to boolean true.
 * 4. The operation is restricted to the files and folders accessible within the configured root directory of the application, ensuring security.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve a list of all CSS or other files inside the [/etc/system/openai/css/search/] directory for display or further processing.
 * - Check which files are available in a specific folder before performing operations like reading, copying, or deleting.
 * - Dynamically generate a file listing for administrative or user-facing interfaces.
