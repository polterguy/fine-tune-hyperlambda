/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot is used to update the value of the [.result] node.
 * 2. It assigns the value `date:"2025-03-22T15:45:00.000Z"` to the [.result] node, effectively setting its value to a specific date and time in UTC format.
 * 3. This approach ensures that [.result] now holds a typed date object, rather than a plain string.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Setting a result node to a fixed date for testing or demonstration purposes in a workflow.
 * - Assigning a scheduled date/time value as the outcome of a calculation or user input.
 * - Preparing a node to be used later in date-based comparisons or scheduling logic.
 * - Providing a default date value in a response or output structure.
