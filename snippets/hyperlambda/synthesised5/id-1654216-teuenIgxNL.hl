/*
 * 1. The [throw] slot is used to raise an exception with the message "Something went wrong when invoking HTTP POST".
 * 2. When executed, this will immediately halt further execution and propagate an error up the call stack.
 * 3. If used within an HTTP endpoint, the exception can be caught by a [.catch] block or, if unhandled, returned to the client depending on configuration.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To signal a failure after an unsuccessful HTTP POST operation.
 * - To abort execution and provide a clear error message to the client or calling code.
 * - To trigger error handling logic in a [try]/[.catch] construct after a failed external API call.
