/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.dp/#` to a new value.
 * 2. The [strings.to-lower] slot converts the current value of the same node (`:x:@.dp/#`) to all lowercase characters, and this lowercase result is used as the new value by [set-value].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Normalizing all user input nodes to lowercase for case-insensitive comparisons.
 * - Cleaning up text data before storing it in a database to ensure consistent formatting.
 * - Automatically transforming all string properties in a collection to lowercase during data processing.
