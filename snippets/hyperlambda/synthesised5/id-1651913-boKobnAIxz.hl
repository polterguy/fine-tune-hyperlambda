/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used here to add new nodes to all nodes referenced by the expression `:x:../*/return-nodes/0/-/*/columns`. This expression navigates to the [columns] node(s) of a specific sibling or ancestor structure, likely within a loop or dynamic context.
 * 2. The child node of [add] is a dot node (.), which means the added node will be a direct child of each [columns] node found by the expression.
 * 3. The value of the added node is set dynamically using the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/name`, which retrieves the [name] child node of the node currently referenced by [.dp] (usually the current item in a [for-each] loop, passed by reference).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically populating a [columns] node with the names of fields or properties from a set of data nodes during iteration.
 * - Building a list of column names for a table or grid structure based on the current data context.
 * - Generating metadata or schema information for a data export or transformation process.
