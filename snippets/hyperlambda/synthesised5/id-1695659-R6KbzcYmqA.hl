/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot is used here to delete nodes from the tree.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@signal/*/*/db/=mysql` targets all nodes named [db] that are grandchildren of [signal], and only if their value is exactly "mysql".
 * 3. When this code is executed, all such [db] nodes with the value "mysql" are removed from the current tree structure.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up configuration data by removing all [db] nodes set to "mysql" under a [signal] node.
 * - Preparing a data structure to exclude certain database types before serialization or export.
 * - Dynamically altering workflow definitions that should not include MySQL-related database nodes.
