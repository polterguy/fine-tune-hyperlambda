/*
 * 1. The [set-name] slot changes the name of all nodes found using the expression `@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column` to a new name provided as its single argument.
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [.group_column] node under [.arguments], which is then used as the new name for the selected nodes.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically renaming group-by columns in a SQL query builder based on user input or API arguments.
 * - Adapting the grouping logic of a database query by mapping runtime-supplied group column names into the Hyperlambda structure.
 * - Supporting customizable reports where the group-by fields are selected at runtime and must be reflected in the execution tree.
 * - Aligning node names in a data pipeline with external data sources or schema changes without hardcoding values.
