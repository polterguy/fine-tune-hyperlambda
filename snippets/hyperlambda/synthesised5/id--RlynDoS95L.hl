/*
 * 1. The [auth.ticket.create] slot generates a new JWT token.
 * 2. The [username] child node specifies the username for which the token will be generated, in this case, "alice".
 * 3. The [roles] node contains a single child node with the value "user", assigning the "user" role to the generated token.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Issue a JWT token for a user named "alice" with basic user privileges.
 * - Automate token creation for user authentication during registration.
 * - Grant role-based access to endpoints by generating tokens with specific roles.
 * - Facilitate testing of authentication mechanisms by issuing tokens for different roles.
