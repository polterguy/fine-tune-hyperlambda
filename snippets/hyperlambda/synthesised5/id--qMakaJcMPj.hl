/*
 * 1. The [http.post] slot sends an HTTP POST request to "https://upload.example.com".
 * 2. The [filename] node specifies that the file "/files/report.pdf" will be attached as the request body, allowing direct streaming of the file to the endpoint without loading it entirely into memory.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Uploading a PDF report from the local file system to a remote server for archival.
 * - Submitting large files to an API endpoint efficiently, avoiding high memory usage.
 * - Automating document delivery workflows where files need to be transferred to a third-party service.
