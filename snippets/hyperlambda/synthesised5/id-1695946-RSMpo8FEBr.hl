 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it returns whatever value is currently assigned to the [.fields] node.
 * 2. The expression `@.fields` specifically targets the first node named [.fields] that is found at the same level or as a sibling in the current node structure.
 * 3. The returned value can be of any type, depending on what is stored in [.fields], such as a string, number, or any other supported type.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the value of an input parameter stored in [.fields] for use in further processing.
 * - Validating or logging the current value of [.fields] during an execution flow.
 * - Passing the value of [.fields] as an argument to another slot or operation.
