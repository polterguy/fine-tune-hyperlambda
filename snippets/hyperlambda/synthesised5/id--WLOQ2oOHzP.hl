/*
 * 1. The [.input] node is created with three child nodes, each containing the values "A", "B", and "C".
 * 2. The [strings.join] slot is invoked, targeting all child nodes of [.input] using the expression `:x:@.input/*`.
 * 3. The separator for joining the strings is specified as "," by providing a child node with value "," to [strings.join].
 * 4. The resulting output is a single string "A,B,C" where each original value from [.input]'s children is concatenated with a comma between them.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating a comma-separated list from a collection of strings for CSV export.
 * - Merging multiple user inputs into a single string with a custom delimiter.
 * - Formatting a list of tags or categories into a display or storage-friendly format.
 * - Preparing data for a query or API that expects a single string of values separated by a specific character.
