 * 1. The [case] node checks if the value matches "mysql", and if so, executes its child nodes.
 * 2. The [set-value] slot updates the value of all [.master] nodes in the current context to "information_schema".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically set the [.master] node to "information_schema" when the database type is MySQL.
 * - Configure database metadata queries to target the MySQL system schema.
 * - Adapt logic based on the database vendor by switching the value of [.master] accordingly.
