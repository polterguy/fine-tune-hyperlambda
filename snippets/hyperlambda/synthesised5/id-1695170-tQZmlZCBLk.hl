/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot checks if every node matched by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/offset` exists and has a non-null value. If any [offset] node is missing or its value is null, it throws an exception, effectively enforcing that this argument must be provided when executing the code.
 * 2. The `:x:@.arguments/*/offset` expression targets all [offset] nodes that are direct children of any node under [.arguments], which is typically used to validate input arguments in an endpoint or dynamic slot.
 * 3. This slot does not return a value; its sole purpose is to enforce the presence of required arguments, improving input validation and error handling.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring a required [offset] argument is always supplied in paginated API endpoints.
 * - Validating user input in dynamic slots where [offset] is mandatory for correct execution.
 * - Preventing downstream errors caused by missing [offset] values in business logic.
 * - Enforcing strict input contracts in HTTP endpoints for reliable data processing.
