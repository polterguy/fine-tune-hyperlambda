/*
 * 1. The [lambda2hyper] node appears to be a container or parent node for the following operations.
 * 2. The [key] node uses the [set-value] pattern with an expression `:x:@io.file.load`, which means it sets the value of [key] to the value of the [io.file.load] node. This typically implies that a file was loaded previously, and its contents are now being assigned to [key].
 * 3. The [fingerprint] node uses the [set-value] pattern with an expression `:x:@crypto.fingerprint`, assigning the value of the [crypto.fingerprint] node to [fingerprint]. This suggests that a fingerprint (likely a hash or unique identifier) was generated earlier and is now being stored in [fingerprint].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Assigning the contents of a loaded file to the [key] node and storing a previously generated fingerprint in the [fingerprint] node for later use.
 * - Preparing data for further processing, such as verifying the integrity of a file by comparing its content ([key]) and its fingerprint ([fingerprint]).
 * - Storing both a file's content and its associated fingerprint in a single structure for downstream validation or audit purposes.
