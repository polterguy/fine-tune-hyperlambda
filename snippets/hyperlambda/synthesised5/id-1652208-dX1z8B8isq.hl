/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot checks if the [EmployeeID] node exists as a child node under any node within [.arguments]. 
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/EmployeeID` targets all [EmployeeID] nodes that are direct children of any child node under [.arguments].
 * 3. If any targeted [EmployeeID] node is missing or has a null value, an exception is thrown, preventing further execution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that an API endpoint always receives an [EmployeeID] argument before processing a request.
 * - Validating form submissions to guarantee that the [EmployeeID] field is filled in.
 * - Enforcing business logic that requires an [EmployeeID] for operations such as employee lookup or update.
