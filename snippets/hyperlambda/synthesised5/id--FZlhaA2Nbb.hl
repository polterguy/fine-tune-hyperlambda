/*
 * 1. The [cache.try-get] slot attempts to retrieve an item from the cache using the key [cache-key].  
 * 2. If the item does not exist, the [.lambda] child is invoked, which executes the [return] slot with the value "Howdy world" to generate the cache item.  
 * 3. The resulting value from the [.lambda] is stored in the cache under the [cache-key] for 5 seconds as specified by the [expiration] node.  
 * 4. Subsequent requests within the expiration period will return the cached value directly without invoking the [.lambda] child.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Efficiently cache the result of an expensive database query for 5 seconds to minimize repeated computation and database load.
 * - Cache the output of a slow external API call, so only the first request within the cache window triggers the actual call.
 * - Temporarily store frequently accessed but rarely changing data, such as configuration values, to improve performance by avoiding repeated generation.
