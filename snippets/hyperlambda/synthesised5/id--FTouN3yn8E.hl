/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used here with an expression `:x:@.storage`, which targets the [.storage] node as the destination to add new child nodes.
 * 2. Inside [add], a data node (with just a dot as its name) groups three child nodes: [itemAlpha], [itemBeta], and [itemGamma], each with their own value ([detailAlpha], [detailBeta], [detailGamma] respectively).
 * 3. As a result, these three nodes become children of the [.storage] node, effectively extending its collection with new items and their associated details.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically append multiple inventory items to a storage list within a workflow.
 * - Batch register several user-defined objects into an in-memory repository.
 * - Collect and organize sets of related data (such as log entries or configuration parameters) under a single parent node for further processing or exporting.
 * - Build out hierarchical data structures where repeated grouping of items is required.
