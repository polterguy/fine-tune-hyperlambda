/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot is used to assign values to nodes. The first [set-value] replaces all instances of the string `{{name}}` in the value of [.template] with "Sarah" and stores the result in [.final-message].  
 * 2. The [strings.replace] slot is called twice: first to substitute the placeholder `{{name}}` with "Sarah", and second to substitute `{{confirmation_link}}` with the provided URL in the value of [.final-message].  
 * 3. The second [set-value] updates [.final-message] in place, ensuring both placeholders are replaced in sequence.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Sending personalized email messages by dynamically inserting recipient names and unique confirmation links.
 * - Generating custom notifications or alerts from a template containing user-specific placeholders.
 * - Automating document creation where fields need to be dynamically filled before sending or storing.
 * - Producing customized onboarding messages for different users based on a single template.
