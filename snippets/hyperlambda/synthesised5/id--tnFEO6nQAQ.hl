/*
 * 1. The [sqlite.connect] slot establishes a connection to the SQLite database identified by the connection string or alias [university]. This allows subsequent database operations to be executed in the context of this connection.
 * 2. The [sqlite.create] slot inserts a new record into the [students] table. This slot utilizes the [values] child node to specify the data for the new student, with fields [student_id], [name], and [major] being set with their respective values.
 * 3. The [values] node organizes the column-value pairs to be inserted, ensuring data is mapped correctly into the database table and types like [int] are properly handled.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Adding a new student record to the university database, such as during a student enrollment process.
 * - Scripting initial data seeding for the [students] table in a test or development environment.
 * - Automating student record creation in response to form submissions from an admissions portal.
 * - Populating sample data for demonstrating application features or database functionality.
