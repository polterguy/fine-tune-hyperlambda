/*
 * 1. The [io.file.delete] slot deletes a file from the filesystem.  
 * 2. The value "x:-" is an expression that points to the previous sibling node, so the file path to delete is dynamically determined based on the node above this one in the execution tree.
 * 3. If the file does not exist at the specified path, an exception will be thrown.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Remove a file that was just processed or generated in a previous step.
 * - Clean up temporary files after a workflow is completed.
 * - Delete user-uploaded files after they are no longer needed.
