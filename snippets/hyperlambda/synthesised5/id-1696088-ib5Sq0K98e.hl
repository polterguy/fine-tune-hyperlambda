/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node(s) specified by the expression provided in its value argument.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/limit` navigates to all [limit] child nodes under any node inside [.arguments], and [get-value] returns their value(s).
 * 3. This slot is typically used for extracting input arguments, such as user-supplied values, from the [.arguments] node in an HTTP endpoint or a dynamic slot.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving a pagination limit from endpoint arguments to control the number of returned records.
 * - Accessing a configuration value named [limit] supplied by the user to dynamically adjust processing.
 * - Fetching a [limit] argument for use in downstream logic, such as validation or conditional branching.
