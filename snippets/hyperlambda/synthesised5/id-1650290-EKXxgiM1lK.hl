/*
 * 1. The [http.post] slot sends an HTTP POST request to the specified URL, which in this case is the HubSpot API endpoint for creating contacts.
 * 2. The [headers] node specifies custom HTTP headers for the request, including [Authorization] with a Bearer token for authentication, and [Content-Type] set to "application/json" to indicate the payload format.
 * 3. The [payload] node defines the body of the POST request, and contains a [properties] node, which is where contact data should be provided according to HubSpot's API requirements.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating a new contact in HubSpot by providing contact properties inside the [properties] node.
 * - Integrating external systems with HubSpot CRM to automate contact creation.
 * - Sending authenticated API requests with custom headers and JSON payloads to third-party services.
