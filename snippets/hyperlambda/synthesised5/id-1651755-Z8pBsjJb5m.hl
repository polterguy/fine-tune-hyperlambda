/*
 * 1. The [response.headers.set] slot is used to explicitly set HTTP response headers for the outgoing response.
 * 2. The [Content-Type] header is set to "text/csv", indicating that the response body will be in CSV format.
 * 3. The [Access-Control-Expose-Headers] header is set to "Content-Disposition", allowing browsers to access the Content-Disposition header in CORS scenarios.
 * 4. The [Content-Disposition] header is set to "attachment; filename=\"leads.csv\"", instructing browsers to prompt the user to download the response as a file named "leads.csv".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a dynamically generated CSV file for download from an HTTP endpoint.
 * - Enabling cross-origin JavaScript clients to access the Content-Disposition header when downloading files.
 * - Serving CSV exports of data, such as user leads, from a web application backend.
