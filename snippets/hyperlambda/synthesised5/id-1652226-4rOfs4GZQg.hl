/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to broadcast a SignalR event named "northwind.Order Details.delete" to connected clients or subscribers. 
 * 2. The [args] node is included as a child, which means any arguments placed under [args] would be serialized as JSON and sent with the signal. In this case, [args] is empty, so no additional data is transmitted with the signal.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Notifying all connected clients that an "Order Details" record has been deleted in the Northwind system, so they can update their UI or data accordingly.
 * - Triggering client-side logic (such as refreshing a table or showing a message) when an order detail is deleted.
 * - Coordinating real-time updates across multiple users or systems when deletions occur in the "Order Details" entity.
