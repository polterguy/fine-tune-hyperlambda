/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot is used to retrieve the value of a specific node, based on the result of its expression argument.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.sql` points to the first node named [.sql] in the current context, and [get-value] returns its value.
 * 3. If [.sql] exists and has a value, [get-value] yields that value; if not, the result will be null.
 * 4. This construct is commonly used to extract data from nodes dynamically, allowing for flexible and reusable code that adapts to the execution context.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Accessing the value of a SQL statement or query stored in [.sql] for further processing or logging.
 * - Dynamically pulling configuration or command text from a node named [.sql] in a workflow.
 * - Returning the result of a previously generated SQL string to another part of a Hyperlambda execution tree.
 * - Conditionally executing logic based on the presence or content of the [.sql] node's value.
