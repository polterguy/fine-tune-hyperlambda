/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return data from a dynamic slot or endpoint. It will forward evaluate any expressions inside its children.
 * 2. The [orders] node inside [yield] is assigned the result of the expression `:x:@data.read/*`, which means it will contain all child nodes of the [data.read] node.
 * 3. This code is typically used to return a list of orders or similar data read from a previous operation, making the result available to the caller.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a list of orders fetched from a database or data source in an API endpoint.
 * - Providing a collection of records as the result of a dynamic slot execution.
 * - Exposing data read from a file or stream to the client in a structured response.
