/*
 * 1. The [if] slot tests if a condition is true; here, it checks a static boolean true value.
 * 2. The [.lambda] node contains the code to execute if the [if] condition is satisfied.
 * 3. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.result] node to "Yes" if the condition is met.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Setting a node’s value only if a certain condition is true, such as confirming a user’s status.
 * - Executing specific actions based on runtime conditions, for example, indicating a successful operation.
 * - Initializing or updating a result flag when a prerequisite check passes.
