/*
 * 1. [if]: Checks if there are any child nodes under the [data.select] node using the `exists:x:@data.select/*` condition.
 * 2. [.lambda]: If the condition is true (i.e., [data.select] has children), this lambda block is executed.
 * 3. [yield]: Returns the values referenced by the `url:x:@data.select/*/*/id` expression, which collects all [id] nodes under all children of all children of [data.select].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To return a list of [id] values from a SQL query result when [data.select] contains multiple result rows.
 * - For extracting and yielding identifiers after a database select operation, such as when fetching user IDs.
 * - To conditionally return results only if a select operation produced data.
 * - For chaining database queries and using the resulting IDs in subsequent operations, only if the result set is non-empty.
