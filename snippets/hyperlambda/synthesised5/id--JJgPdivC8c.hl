/*
 * 1. The [.src] node is created with a value of "foo1".
 * 2. [get-first-value] is used with the expression `:x:../*/.src`, which retrieves the first non-null value among all sibling [.src] nodes at the same level as the current node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve a primary value from a group of possible sources, using only the first available.
 * - Implement fallback logic when multiple sources may or may not provide a value.
 * - Ensure only one value is returned even when several candidate nodes might be present.
 * - Use in configuration scenarios to prioritize user-supplied settings over defaults.
