/*
 * 1. The [data.update] slot is used to update records in a database table.  
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies that the database being used is SQLite.  
 * 3. The [table] node indicates that the update operation will target the [notes] table.  
 * 4. The [values] node is present but empty, meaning no columns or values to update have been specified yet.  
 * 5. The [where] node, with a child [and] node, sets up a condition for which records should be updated, but no specific conditions have been defined yet.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - As a template for updating records in the [notes] table in a SQLite database, where you will later specify which columns to update and the conditions for selecting records.
 * - To construct a dynamic update operation where both the fields to update and the filtering criteria are determined at runtime.
 * - As a starting point for a bulk update operation, where you will add multiple conditions under [and] to precisely target records for modification.
