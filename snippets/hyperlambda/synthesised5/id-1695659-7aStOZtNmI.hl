/*
 * 1. The [signal] slot is used to broadcast or send a message to subscribers, but here it is invoked with the value `:x:@strings.concat`, which means it will execute the children of the [strings.concat] node in the current execution tree and use the result as the signal name or channel to notify.
 * 2. The [connection-string] node is referenced by `connection-string:x:@.connection-string`, making it an argument to the signal. The expression `:x:@.connection-string` reads the value of the [connection-string] node from the current context and passes it to the signal as an argument named [connection-string].
 * 3. The code assumes that there is a [strings.concat] node elsewhere in the execution tree, and its result is used to dynamically determine the signal name or target.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically constructing a signal name at runtime, for example to notify different channels based on user or context.
 * - Forwarding a database connection string or other configuration value as part of a signal payload to subscribers.
 * - Integrating with real-time features such as websockets or push notifications, where the signal's channel or name is not static but composed on the fly.
