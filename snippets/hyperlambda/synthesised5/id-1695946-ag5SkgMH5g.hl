/*
 * 1. The [data.select] slot is used here to execute the SQL query found in the value of the [.sql] node. Instead of hardcoding the SQL, it dynamically references the query to execute.
 * 2. The [database-type] argument is set to "sqlite", which instructs the [data.select] operation to treat the target database as a SQLite database, ensuring correct SQL dialect handling.
 * 3. By using an expression for the SQL and specifying the database type, the code enables flexible, runtime selection of both the SQL command and the database system.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically select and execute different SQL queries depending on user input or application state, by setting the value of [.sql].
 * - Support multi-database environments where the backend may change, simply by modifying the [database-type] value.
 * - Use as part of a generic data access layer, allowing for easy integration with SQLite databases while keeping the SQL definition separate for maintainability.
 * - Helps in scenarios where SQL queries need to be constructed programmatically or loaded from external sources before execution.
