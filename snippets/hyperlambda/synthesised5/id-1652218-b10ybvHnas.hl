/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot checks if the [EmployeeID] node exists within each child of [.arguments] and has a non-null value.
 * 2. If any [EmployeeID] node is missing or its value is null, the slot throws an exception, preventing further execution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that an API endpoint always receives an [EmployeeID] argument in the request payload.
 * - Validating form submissions to require the [EmployeeID] field before processing.
 * - Enforcing business logic that mandates the presence of [EmployeeID] in batch operations over multiple argument sets.
