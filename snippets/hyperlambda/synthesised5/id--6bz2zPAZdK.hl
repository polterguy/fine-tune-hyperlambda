/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks a condition and only executes its [.lambda] child if the condition is true. Here, the condition uses [get-value] to retrieve the value of the [foo] node inside [.arguments].
 * 2. The [set-value] slot inside [.lambda] assigns the value "yup!" to the [.dest] node if the condition is satisfied.
 * 3. The [.arguments] node is used as a container for input parameters, with [foo] expected to be set to a boolean value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Setting [.dest] to "yup!" only when [.arguments]/[foo] is true, such as in feature toggles or permission checks.
 * - Conditional branching in workflow logic based on input flags.
 * - Validating user input and providing confirmation messages.
