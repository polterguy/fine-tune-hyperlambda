 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates its child nodes' values into a single string. In this case, it combines the static string [/etc/system/openai/pdf/] with the value retrieved from the [file] node inside the [.arguments] node using [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/file].
 * 
 * 2. The [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/file] slot fetches the value of the [file] argument provided to the endpoint or function.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Constructing a full file path by appending a user-supplied filename to a fixed directory path.
 * - Dynamically generating resource paths based on input arguments.
 * - Preparing file system locations for reading or writing files using user input combined with predefined directories.
