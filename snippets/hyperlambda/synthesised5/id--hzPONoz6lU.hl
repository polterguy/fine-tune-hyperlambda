/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a connection to the [sales_db] database, allowing subsequent database operations to occur within this connection scope.
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies that the database being connected to is MySQL, ensuring correct SQL dialect and driver usage.
 * 3. The [data.read] slot performs a SQL SELECT operation on the [transactions] table, retrieving data from the connected MySQL database.
 * 4. The [limit] node restricts the result set to 20 records, effectively paging the data or limiting bandwidth and processing requirements.
 * 5. The [sort] and [direction] nodes arrange the returned records in ascending order based on the [transaction_date] column, allowing users to view transactions from earliest to latest.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the 20 earliest transactions from a sales database for review or reporting.
 * - Displaying the first page of transaction history to a user in a web application interface.
 * - Performing time-based analytics on recent sales by retrieving a manageable subset of transaction records.
 * - Testing or debugging database queries by limiting result size and ordering by date.
 * - Integrating with front-end applications that require sorted and paged data from the transactions table.
