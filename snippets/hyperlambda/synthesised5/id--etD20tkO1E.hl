/*
 * 1. The [strings.contains] slot checks if the value of the string provided as its argument node is present within the source string specified as its value argument.
 * 2. In this code, [strings.contains] examines if the substring from its child node (which is "lambda") exists within "MagicLambda".
 * 3. If "lambda" (from its child node) is found inside "MagicLambda", the slot will return true, otherwise it returns false.
 * 4. This slot is commonly used for conditional logic, data validation, or filtering based on string content.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Determining if an input string contains a required keyword before processing.
 * - Implementing search or filter features where only items containing a substring should be included.
 * - Validating user input to check if it contains forbidden or required words.
 * - Conditional branching in workflows that depend on the presence of a substring within a larger string.
