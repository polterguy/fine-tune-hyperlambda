/*
 * 1. The [.veryBigNumber] node is being defined with the type `ulong` (unsigned 64-bit integer).
 * 2. The value assigned to [.veryBigNumber] is 1234567890123456789, which is a very large positive integer.
 * 3. By explicitly specifying the type as `ulong`, this node ensures support for very large, non-negative integer values beyond the range of standard 32-bit integers.
 * 4. This node can be referenced in expressions or calculations elsewhere in the Hyperlambda code, for example as input to math operations or formatting slots.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Storing a unique identifier or large numeric value such as a database key or account balance.
 * - Passing the value to [int2words] to convert the large number into its written word representation.
 * - Using it in [math.multiply] or [math.add] operations where high-precision, large values are required.
 * - Formatting the value for display using the [format] slot, for example to add thousand separators or ensure fixed digit length.
