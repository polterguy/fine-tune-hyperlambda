/*
 * 1. The [io.file.load] slot reads the contents of the file located at "/foo.hl" and returns its text data.
 * 2. The [hyper2lambda] slot then parses this loaded text as Hyperlambda, converting it into a lambda node hierarchy that can be programmatically manipulated.
 * 3. Finally, the [eval] slot executes the lambda hierarchy created from the file, running the logic defined within the loaded Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically load a workflow or business logic from a file and execute it at runtime.
 * - Implement a plugin system where new Hyperlambda modules can be dropped into a folder and executed without modifying the core application.
 * - Enable administrators to update automation rules or scripts by simply editing Hyperlambda files, which are then loaded and executed on demand.
 * - Support remote execution scenarios by transmitting Hyperlambda files to the server for immediate parsing and execution.
