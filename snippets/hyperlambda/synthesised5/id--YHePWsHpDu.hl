/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a connection to the database specified by the [auth_db] connection string or identifier.
 * 2. The [database-type] node set to "pgsql" under [data.connect] ensures that the connection uses the PostgreSQL database adapter, regardless of the default database type.
 * 3. The [data.read] slot, nested under [data.connect], is used to read records from the database once the connection is established.
 * 4. The second [database-type] node, also set to "pgsql" under [data.read], explicitly instructs the read operation to use PostgreSQL SQL dialect and adapter for the query.
 * 5. The [table] node with value [user_accounts] specifies that the operation will fetch data from the [user_accounts] table.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving all user accounts from a PostgreSQL database, regardless of what the system's default database type is set to.
 * - Ensuring PostgreSQL-specific SQL syntax is used for both connection and data access within a multi-database environment.
 * - Reading user account data in authentication modules where database type flexibility is required.
 * - Accessing user tables from a centralized authentication database when supporting multiple database vendors.
 * - Performing user data migrations or audits from a PostgreSQL-backed authentication store.
