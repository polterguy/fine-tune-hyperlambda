/*
 * 1. The [validators.regex] slot is used to validate the value of each [name] node found under all children of [.arguments] by matching them against a regular expression.
 * 2. The [regex] child node specifies the pattern `^[a-z0-9_-]{2,20}$`, which enforces that the value must be between 2 and 20 characters long and only contain lowercase letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens.
 * 3. If any [name] node does not match this pattern, an exception will be thrown, identifying the invalid value and the argument name.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring usernames or IDs provided in an API request conform to specific allowed characters and length restrictions.
 * - Validating input fields in a form to prevent invalid or potentially harmful data.
 * - Enforcing consistent naming conventions for resources created by users.
