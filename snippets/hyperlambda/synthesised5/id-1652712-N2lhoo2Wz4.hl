/*
 * 1. The [include] slot is used to execute the children of the [data.read] node and include its results in the current execution context. The expression `:x:@data.read/*` points to all children of the [data.read] node, effectively running the shipment query.
 * 2. The [data.read] slot is used to select records from the [Shipment] table. It specifies the columns [ShipmentId] and [DispatchDate] to be returned.
 * 3. The [where] clause filters the results to only include shipments where the [WarehouseId] column matches the value referenced by the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/WarehouseId`. This likely refers to the [WarehouseId] of the current item being processed in a parent loop or context.
 * 4. The [yield] slot returns the results of the shipment query as a node named [shipments], containing all records returned by the [data.read] invocation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving all shipments related to a specific warehouse, where the warehouse context is dynamically determined by a parent loop or process.
 * - Including shipment data as a subquery or related dataset when processing or exporting warehouse information.
 * - Filtering and returning only the [ShipmentId] and [DispatchDate] for shipments associated with a particular warehouse for reporting or integration purposes.
