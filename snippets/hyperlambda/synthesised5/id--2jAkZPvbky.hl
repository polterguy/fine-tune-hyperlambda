/*
 * 1. The [io.file.load] slot loads the contents of the file named "/README.md" as a string and stores the result as the value of the [io.file.load] node.
 * 2. The [strings.split] slot takes the contents loaded from [io.file.load], splits it by newline characters (`"\n"`), and produces a node set where each child node contains a single line from the file.
 * 3. The [for-each] slot iterates through each line node produced by [strings.split], and for each line, the [log.info] slot logs the content of that line to the log output.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Reading a text file and logging each line for audit or debugging purposes.
 * - Importing a configuration or data file, processing each line individually.
 * - Monitoring or tracking changes in a file by outputting its contents line by line.
 * - Quickly reviewing or printing the contents of a text file through logs.
