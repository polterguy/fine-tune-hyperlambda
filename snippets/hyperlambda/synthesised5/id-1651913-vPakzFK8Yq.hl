/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates over each child node of [sqlite.select], passing each node by reference into [.dp].
 * 2. The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate all grandchildren of the currently iterated node, effectively resolving any expressions or dynamic content within those nodes before further processing.
 * 3. The [add] slot appends a new node to the [columns] node, which is located by traversing up the tree from the current context. The new node's value is set to the [name] child node of the currently iterated node (from [.dp]).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically collecting all column names from the results of a SQL select operation and appending them to a [columns] node for further processing or output.
 * - Building a list of field names from a database query to use in generating table headers or data mappings.
 * - Aggregating metadata about query results for documentation, validation, or transformation purposes.
