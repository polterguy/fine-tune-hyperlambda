/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to broadcast a message named "magic.backend.message" to all connected clients who belong to the [roles] of "root".
 * 2. The [roles] node restricts the message so that only users assigned the "root" role will receive the notification.
 * 3. The [args] node provides additional data that will be sent as a JSON object to the subscribers, including a [message] node with status information and a [type] node indicating the result as "success".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Notifying administrators (root users) that OpenAI training data creation from a list of URLs has completed successfully.
 * - Sending success messages to privileged users after backend operations finish.
 * - Providing real-time feedback in admin dashboards for monitoring the status of automated backend processes.
 * - Broadcasting operation results to a specific group of users based on their role.
