/*
 * 1. [set-name]: This slot renames all nodes referenced by the expression `@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column` to a new name. The new name is determined by the result of the [get-value] slot.
 * 2. [get-value]: This slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `@.arguments/*/group_column`, which is expected to provide the desired new name for the nodes being renamed.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically rename all [group_column] nodes under the [group] clause of multiple [data.read] statements to match the value supplied in the request or arguments.
 * - Standardize grouping column names in SQL query construction based on external input, such as user selection or API arguments.
 * - Mass update grouping keys when building or transforming SQL queries programmatically, ensuring that the grouping columns match the intended specification.
 * - Useful in scenarios where the grouping column name is parameterized and must be set according to runtime context before query generation.
