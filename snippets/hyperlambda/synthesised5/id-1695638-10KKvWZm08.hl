/*
 * 1. The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expression `:x:./*/return/*` before the instruction pointer reaches the node where [unwrap] is invoked. This means any expressions pointing to child nodes of sibling [return] nodes will be resolved and their values inserted in place.
 * 2. By unwrapping the values, the slot ensures that subsequent operations receive fully evaluated results, rather than unevaluated expressions or node references.
 * 3. [unwrap] is particularly useful in scenarios where expressions may yield dynamic or context-dependent values, ensuring that these are computed prior to further processing.
 * 4. If the expression returns multiple nodes, [unwrap] would throw an exception unless used with [apply-lists:bool:true], ensuring only a single node is processed by default.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Pre-evaluating return values in a dynamic or composite workflow before passing them to another slot or endpoint.
 * - Collecting and flattening all output nodes from sibling [return] slots for aggregation or further manipulation.
 * - Ensuring that the result of an operation is fully resolved before serialization or logging.
