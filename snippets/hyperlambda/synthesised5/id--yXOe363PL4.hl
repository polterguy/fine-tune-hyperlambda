/*
 * 1. The [get-name] slot retrieves the name of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.grandparent/*/*/target/^.grandparent` navigates to a [target] node that is a grandchild of [.grandparent], then traverses up the tree to find its first ancestor named [.grandparent].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Determine the name of a root or higher-level ancestor node from a specific descendant's context.
 * - Validate or log which top-level node a deeply nested node belongs to.
 * - Implement logic that depends on the hierarchical ownership of a node, such as enforcing rules based on ancestor node names.
 * - Dynamically reference or manipulate data based on the ancestor's identity in a complex tree structure.
