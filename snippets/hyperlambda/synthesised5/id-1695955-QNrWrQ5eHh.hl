/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot is used here to retrieve the value of the node named [.sql] by referencing it through the expression `:x:@.sql`.
 * 2. The expression `@.sql` means it will search for the first ancestor or sibling node named [.sql] in the current execution context and get its value.
 * 3. The result of [get-value] will be the value contents of the located [.sql] node, which can be a string, number, or any type supported by Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the actual SQL query string from a [.sql] node to use it in database operations.
 * - Fetching a pre-defined value from [.sql] to pass to another slot as an argument.
 * - Dynamically referencing and using the value of [.sql] in conditional logic or logging.
