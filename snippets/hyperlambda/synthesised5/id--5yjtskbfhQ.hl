/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a connection to a database, using either [foo] or [bar] as the connection string or identifier. This determines which database instance will be accessed for subsequent operations.
 * 2. The [data.scalar] slot executes a SQL query (`select count(*) from users`) against the connected database and retrieves a single scalar value, specifically the total number of rows in the [users] table. The result of this query becomes the value of the [data.scalar] node after execution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To quickly determine the total number of user records in either the [foo] or [bar] database without retrieving individual user data.
 * - As part of a dashboard or monitoring system that tracks the growth or size of the [users] table across different environments (e.g., development vs. production).
 * - For validating database migrations or synchronizations by comparing user counts between two databases.
 * - To perform conditional logic elsewhere in your workflow based on the number of users present in a database.
