/*
 * 1. The [pgsql.connect] slot establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database named "climate".
 * 2. The [pgsql.scalar] slot executes a scalar SQL query, specifically `select max(temperature) from sensor_readings`, which calculates the maximum value of the [temperature] column in the [sensor_readings] table.
 * 3. The [yield] slot returns the result of the [pgsql.scalar] slot as a node named [max-temperature], making the maximum temperature value available as output.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To quickly retrieve the highest recorded temperature from a set of sensor readings for reporting or alerting purposes.
 * - As part of a dashboard that displays climate statistics, needing the maximum temperature for a given time period.
 * - In an automated monitoring system that checks if the maximum temperature exceeds a certain threshold for further action.
 * - For generating summary statistics on historical climate data stored in a PostgreSQL database.
