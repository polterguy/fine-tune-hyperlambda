/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `@.fields`.
 * 2. The `@.fields` expression points to the first node named [.fields] that exists before the [get-value] node within the current execution context.
 * 3. The slot returns the value (not the children or structure) of the [.fields] node, which can be used as input for further processing or assignment.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching user input or configuration stored in a [.fields] node for validation or display.
 * - Passing the value of [.fields] to another slot for processing, such as saving to a database.
 * - Using [get-value] in a conditional statement to trigger logic based on the contents of [.fields].
