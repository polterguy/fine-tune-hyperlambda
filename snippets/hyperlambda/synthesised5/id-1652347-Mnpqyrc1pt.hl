/*
 * 1. The [response.headers.set] slot is used to set HTTP response headers for the outgoing response.
 * 2. The code sets the [Cache-Control] header to "public, max-age=300", instructing clients and proxies that the response can be cached by any cache and should be considered fresh for 300 seconds (5 minutes).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To enable client-side and proxy caching for static or infrequently changing resources, reducing server load and improving response times.
 * - To control cache behavior for API responses where data does not change often and can be safely cached for a short period.
 * - To explicitly override default cache settings for specific endpoints in your application.
