/*
 * 1. The [tasks.list] slot is used to retrieve a list of tasks from the system. By providing an expression as its value (`:x:@.arguments/*/filter`), it dynamically uses the value of the [filter] node inside the [.arguments] node to filter the returned tasks.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/filter` allows the filtering criteria to be passed in at runtime, making the task listing flexible and adaptable to different filtering needs.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Displaying a filtered list of tasks in a user interface based on user-specified criteria.
 * - Creating an API endpoint that allows clients to retrieve only tasks matching certain filters, such as status or priority.
 * - Automating reporting by retrieving only tasks that meet specific conditions for further processing.
