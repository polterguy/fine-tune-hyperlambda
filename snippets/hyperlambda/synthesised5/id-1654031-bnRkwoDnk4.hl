/*
 * 1. The [data.execute] slot is used to execute a raw SQL statement that deletes records from the [vss_ml_training_snippets] table, based on a condition.
 * 2. The SQL statement deletes rows from [vss_ml_training_snippets] where the [rowid] matches any [id] from the [ml_training_snippets] table where the [type] column equals the provided parameter.
 * 3. The [type] node supplies a parameter to the SQL statement, with its value dynamically taken from the [.type] node in the current context using the expression `:x:@.type`.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Removing all training snippet records from [vss_ml_training_snippets] that are associated with a specific type in [ml_training_snippets].
 * - Cleaning up related data after deleting or archiving a particular type of machine learning training data.
 * - Enforcing data consistency by ensuring that orphaned or obsolete records of a certain type are removed from the system.
