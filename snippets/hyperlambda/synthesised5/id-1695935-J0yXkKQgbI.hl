/*
 * 1. The [validators.enum] slot is used to ensure that the value of the [aggregate_column] node within [.arguments] is one of a specified set of valid values. If [aggregate_column] does not match any of the listed options, an exception is thrown.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/aggregate_column` navigates to the [aggregate_column] child node inside the [.arguments] node, effectively targeting user or API-provided input.
 * 3. Each child node under [validators.enum] defines an allowed value: [Categories.CategoryID], [Categories.CategoryName], [Categories.Description], or [Categories.Picture]. Only these options are permitted for [aggregate_column].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Preventing invalid column names from being used in an API request that performs aggregate calculations.
 * - Validating user input in a data filtering UI where users must select one of several predefined category columns.
 * - Ensuring that only specific fields can be targeted for further operations, such as grouping or aggregation, in a reporting endpoint.
 * - Limiting the risk of SQL injection or accidental errors by strictly controlling which columns can be referenced dynamically.
