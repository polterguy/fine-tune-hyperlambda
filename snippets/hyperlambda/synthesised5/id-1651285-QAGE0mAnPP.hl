/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates over each child node of [ .species ], passing each node by reference into a [.dp] node for processing.
 * 2. Inside the loop, the [switch] slot examines the value of the [name] child node of the current [.dp] node to determine which case to execute.
 * 3. For each case (Borg, Klingon, Vulcan), the [add] slot appends a [quadrant] node with a specific value (Alpha, Beta, or Gamma) to the currently iterated species node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically assign a quadrant property to each species in a list based on their name.
 * - Enrich a dataset of species with additional metadata for later processing or display.
 * - Categorize or group nodes dynamically according to specific attribute values.
