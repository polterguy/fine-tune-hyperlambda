/*
 * 1. The [int2words] slot takes an integer value as its input and converts it into its full English word representation.
 * 2. For example, with an input value of 1200050, the slot outputs the string "one million two hundred thousand and fifty".
 * 3. This slot supports signed 64-bit integers, so it can be used with very large numbers, including those in the trillions.
 * 4. The purpose is to make numerical values more readable and useful, especially in contexts where text representations improve understanding or compatibility, such as natural language processing tasks.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Enhancing the clarity of invoice amounts by converting numbers to words in generated documents.
 * - Improving semantic search and retrieval in RAG or VSS systems by embedding word-based representations of numbers.
 * - Generating legal or formal documents that require number values to be written out in words.
 * - Assisting accessibility tools that read numbers aloud for visually impaired users.
