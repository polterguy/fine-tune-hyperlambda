/*
 * 1. The [children] slot retrieves all child nodes for each node resulting from the expression `:x:@.data/*`. This means it operates on every direct child node of the [.data] node.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.data/*` selects all immediate child nodes under [.data], so [children] will then return all their respective child nodes.
 * 3. This can be used for scenarios where you need to process or inspect the next hierarchical level below the direct children of [.data].
 * 4. The output will be a node set containing all grandchildren of [.data], i.e., the children of [.data]'s children.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting all sub-items from a list of parent items in a data structure.
 * - Flattening hierarchical data by retrieving the second level of nodes for further processing.
 * - Preparing data for bulk operations on nested collections.
 * - Filtering or transforming only the grandchildren nodes in a document or configuration tree.
