/*
 * 1. The [validators.enum] slot is used to validate that the value of [group_column] (found at the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/group_column`) matches one of a predefined set of allowed values.
 * 2. Each child node under [validators.enum] specifies a valid string value that [group_column] can take. In this case, the allowed values are: "campaigns.campaign_id", "campaigns.name", "campaigns.start_date", "campaigns.end_date", "campaigns.budget", and "campaigns.status".
 * 3. If the value of [group_column] does not match any of these allowed options, an exception is thrown, preventing further execution and ensuring only valid group column values are processed.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring API consumers can only request grouping by specific columns in a reporting or analytics endpoint.
 * - Preventing SQL injection or invalid column references by restricting inputs to known fields.
 * - Safeguarding downstream logic that depends on the value of [group_column] to avoid runtime errors or inconsistent results.
