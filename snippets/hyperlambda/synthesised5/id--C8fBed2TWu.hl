/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot inside the [.lambda] node assigns the value "Hello" to the [.res] node by referencing it with the expression `:x:@.res`.
 * 2. The [eval] slot, using the expression `:x:@.lambda`, executes the [.lambda] node, causing its child nodes (such as [set-value]) to be invoked in order.
 * 3. The [.lambda] node serves as a container for a logic block that can be dynamically executed by [eval].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Executing a reusable logic block stored in a [.lambda] node, such as initializing or updating values.
 * - Running configuration or initialization steps at runtime by referencing specific lambda objects.
 * - Dynamically controlling the flow of execution by choosing which lambda objects to invoke based on conditions.
 * - Centralizing logic so it can be triggered from multiple locations in a Hyperlambda script.
