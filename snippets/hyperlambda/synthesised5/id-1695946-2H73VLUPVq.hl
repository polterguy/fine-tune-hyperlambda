/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression argument, in this case `@.fields`, which points to the first parent or sibling node named [.fields].
 * 2. The `:x:@.fields` expression ensures that [get-value] locates the [.fields] node relative to the current node, and returns its value, which could be any type supported by Hyperlambda.
 * 3. This slot only returns the value, not the node itself or its children, and if the [.fields] node doesn't exist or has a null value, the result will be null.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Fetching configuration or parameter values stored in a [.fields] node to use in subsequent logic.
 * - Passing the value of [.fields] as an argument to another slot or function.
 * - Dynamically reading user input or data fields for validation or processing.
 * - Returning the result of [.fields] as a response in an HTTP endpoint.
