/*
 * 1. The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to at least one of the roles specified in its argumentâ€”a comma-separated list: "root", "admin", or "user". 
 * 2. If the user does not belong to any of these roles, [auth.ticket.verify] throws an exception, immediately halting further execution.
 * 3. This slot is typically placed at the beginning of an HTTP endpoint or any callable that requires access control, ensuring only users with appropriate roles can proceed.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Restricting access to sensitive API endpoints so only administrators, root users, or general users can interact with them.
 * - Placing this check at the top of a file to enforce that only authenticated users with certain roles may execute the logic within the endpoint.
 * - Preventing unauthorized access by automatically rejecting requests from users lacking the required roles, thus improving overall application security.
