/*
 * 1. The [set-name] slot is used to change the names of all nodes matching the expression `@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column` to a new name specified by its source value.
 * 2. The new name is retrieved dynamically using the [get-value] slot, which fetches the value from the [.arguments] node where the child node is named [group_column].
 * 3. This logic enables renaming all [group_column] nodes inside [group] nodes, which are themselves nested under [data.read] nodes, which are under [data.connect], based on a value provided at runtime.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically updating the grouping column names in a database query builder based on user input or API parameters.
 * - Adjusting the structure of a lambda object to match new naming conventions without manually editing each node.
 * - Streamlining multi-tenant or multi-database scenarios where group by columns may vary between data sources.
