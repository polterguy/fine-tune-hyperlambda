/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to append a new child node to the [.result] node. In this context, the child node being added is the output of the [whitelist] slot.
 * 2. The [whitelist] slot limits the available slots to just [return] and [vocabulary] for the scope of its [.lambda] child, creating a sandboxed execution environment.
 * 3. Inside [.lambda], the [vocabulary] slot is called to retrieve a list of all available static slots, and then [return] is used to return all child nodes (the result of [vocabulary]) to the whitelist's result stack.
 * 4. The [add] slot then takes the result from the [whitelist] execution and adds it under [.result].
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Restricting which slots can be used when executing user-provided Hyperlambda, for increased security.
 * - Safely exposing the available slot names to untrusted code or users without enabling access to any other functionality.
 * - Dynamically generating a list of available slots within a controlled, whitelisted environment and appending this list to a result node.
 * - Building administrative or introspective tools that need to expose limited system information in a secure way.
