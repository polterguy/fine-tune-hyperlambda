/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@.sql`. This means it looks for the first node named [.sql] in the current scope and returns its value.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.sql` uses the `@` iterator to find the first node named [.sql] relative to the current location in the execution tree.
 * 3. The result of this operation will be the value stored in the [.sql] node, which could be a string, number, or any other type of value assigned to that node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the generated SQL query string from a [.sql] node after dynamically building a query.
 * - Passing the value of the [.sql] node as a parameter to another slot or for logging/debugging purposes.
 * - Retrieving configuration or template data stored in a [.sql] node for further processing.
