/*
 * 1. The [http.post] slot sends an HTTP POST request to "https://api.example.com/auth/login".
 * 2. The [headers] node allows you to specify custom HTTP headers for the request.
 * 3. The [payload] node is mandatory and contains the data to be sent in the body of the POST request, typically in JSON format.
 * 4. The [convert] node with a value of true instructs the slot to automatically convert the response object to the appropriate type based on the response content.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Authenticating a user by sending login credentials to an API and receiving a token or session information in the response.
 * - Integrating with third-party authentication services that require POST requests with custom headers and payloads.
 * - Automating login processes in backend workflows that need to handle and process the response from authentication endpoints.
