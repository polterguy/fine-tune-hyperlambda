/*
 * 1. The [http.get] slot is used to send a GET request to "https://meowfacts.herokuapp.com/", with [convert] set to true, so the JSON response is automatically transformed into a lambda object.
 * 2. The [if] slot checks if the HTTP status code is between 200 (inclusive) and 300 (exclusive) using [mte] (more than or equal) and [lt] (less than) slots, indicating a successful HTTP response.
 * 3. If the condition passes, [set-value] assigns the first element of the data array from the response to the [.cat-fact] node by extracting it with [get-value].
 * 4. If the request fails or the status code is outside the expected range, [set-value] sets [.cat-fact] to the static string "Failed to fetch cat fact".
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Displaying a random cat fact in a chatbot or web application.
 * - Automatically updating a dashboard widget with a new cat fact.
 * - Providing fallback messaging if the external API is unavailable or returns an error.
 * - Demonstrating how to consume and process API responses with error handling in Hyperlambda.
