/*
 * 1. The [throw] slot is used to raise an exception with the message "I can only deal with CSV files".
 * 2. When this code executes, it immediately stops further execution and propagates the exception up the call stack.
 * 3. If there is a [.catch] handler present higher up in the execution tree, it will handle the exception; otherwise, the exception will propagate to the client or the global exception handler.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To enforce that an endpoint or function only accepts CSV files and rejects all other formats.
 * - To provide a clear error message to clients when they attempt to upload or process a non-CSV file.
 * - As part of input validation logic to ensure correct file type handling in a file processing workflow.
