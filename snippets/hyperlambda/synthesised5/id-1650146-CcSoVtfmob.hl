/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression argument.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@data.read/*/*/birth_date` navigates to the [data.read] node, accesses all of its children and grandchildren, and then filters for nodes named [birth_date].
 * 3. The slot returns the value of the first [birth_date] node found in the resulting node set.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting a user's birth date from a data set returned by a [data.read] operation.
 * - Accessing nested data fields in a hierarchical data structure.
 * - Retrieving a specific property from a collection of records, such as when processing results from a database query.
