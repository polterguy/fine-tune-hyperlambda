/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot combines multiple values into a single string. In this context, it is used to build an SQL query fragment by concatenating its child node values.
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the node specified by its lambda expression. Here, it is used twice: once to fetch the current SQL statement from [.sql], and again to fetch the limit value from the [.arguments] node.
 * 3. The static string node [." order by keyword_count desc, keyword_density desc limit "] is included directly in the concatenation, specifying the ordering and limiting clause for the SQL statement.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Dynamically appending ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses to an existing SQL query string.
 * - Constructing paginated or sorted database queries based on user-supplied arguments.
 * - Generating custom SQL statements where the limit is determined at runtime from endpoint input parameters.
