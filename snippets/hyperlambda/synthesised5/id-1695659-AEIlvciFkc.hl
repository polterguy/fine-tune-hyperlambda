/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot is used to delete nodes from the current lambda graph.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@signal/*/*/db/=template0` identifies all nodes named [db] under any two-level child hierarchy of [signal], where the nodeâ€™s value is equal to "template0".
 * 3. All nodes matching this criteria will be completely removed from the lambda object.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up configuration trees by deleting specific [db] nodes with a value of "template0".
 * - Removing template references from a signal processing structure before further processing.
 * - Dynamically pruning unwanted database configuration nodes from a generated graph to avoid propagation of obsolete templates.
 * - Ensuring only relevant database nodes remain within a complex [signal] hierarchy during migration or transformation tasks.
