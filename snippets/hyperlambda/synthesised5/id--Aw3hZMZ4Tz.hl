/*
 * 1. The [io.file.load] slot reads the content of a file whose path is provided by the [file-path] argument found inside the [.arguments] node.
 * 2. The [strings.split] slot splits the loaded file content into separate nodes based on the space character as a delimiter, turning each word into its own node.
 * 3. The [get-count] slot counts the number of resulting nodes from the split, effectively producing the total number of words separated by spaces.
 * 4. The [yield] slot outputs the final result as a [word-count] node containing the number of words found in the file.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Determining the number of words in a specified text file for analytics or reporting.
 * - Creating a simple word counter service that processes uploaded documents.
 * - Validating file content length or checking that documents meet a minimum or maximum word requirement before further processing.
 * - Integrating with an HTTP endpoint to provide users with instant feedback about file content size.
