/*
 * 1. The [math.multiply] slot multiplies all its child arguments together in sequence.  
 * 2. [get-value] with the expression `:x:@.num` retrieves the integer value stored in the [.num] node, which is 7.  
 * 3. Two static integer values, 2 and 3, are provided as additional arguments to [math.multiply].  
 * 4. [math.multiply] evaluates the sequence 7 * 2 * 3, returning the result 42.  
 * 
 * Use cases:  
 * - Calculating the total number of items when you have a count in a variable node and want to apply multiple multiplicative factors.  
 * - Dynamically multiplying a variable by several constants to get a result for further processing.  
 * - Creating custom mathematical operations in business logic, such as calculating area, price, or scaling numbers in a workflow.  
 * - Generating output values for reporting or dashboard purposes using variable and static multipliers.
