/*
 * 1. The [validators.default] slot checks the children of the node set matched by the `:x:@.arguments` expression. If a [limit] node does not exist as a child, it appends a [limit] node with the value 10 and the type long. If [limit] exists but its value is null, it assigns 10 as its value.
 * 2. The slot ensures a default value for [limit] is present in the [.arguments] node collection, either by creating it or by setting its value if missing.
 * 3. This approach helps simplify argument validation by ensuring downstream logic always finds a valid [limit] value, avoiding the need for repeated null checks.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Setting a default page size for API requests when the client does not provide a [limit] argument.
 * - Ensuring database query limits are always set, preventing unbounded queries if omitted in the input.
 * - Providing a fallback value for optional parameters in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints.
