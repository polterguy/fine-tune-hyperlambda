/*
 * 1. The [and] slot evaluates all its child conditions and returns true only if all of them are true. If any child condition evaluates to false, [and] immediately returns false without evaluating the remaining conditions (short-circuit evaluation).
 * 2. The [username.eq] slot is used as a child of [and], and it checks if the value of the [username] node inside the [.arguments] node matches a specific value or condition, returning true if they are equal.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To validate that a username provided as an argument matches an expected value as part of a larger authentication or authorization check.
 * - To combine this username equality check with other conditions (such as password verification) to enforce multiple requirements before proceeding.
 * - To ensure that only requests with a specific username and other required conditions are processed further in an endpoint.
