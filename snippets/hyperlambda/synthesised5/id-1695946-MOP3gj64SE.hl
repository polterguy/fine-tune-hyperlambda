/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node targeted by its expression argument.  
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.sql` points to the first node named [.sql] in the current execution context.  
 * 3. The value of the [.sql] node is returned by [get-value].  
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the generated SQL command text from a previously constructed [.sql] node for logging or debugging.
 * - Passing the SQL string value from a [.sql] node to another slot or function that requires raw SQL as input.
 * - Dynamically reading the contents of a node named [.sql] after building it programmatically elsewhere in the execution tree.
 * - Validating or inspecting the value of [.sql] before executing related database operations.
