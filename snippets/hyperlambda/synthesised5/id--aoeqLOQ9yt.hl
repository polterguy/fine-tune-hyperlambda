/*
 * 1. [slots.create] is used to define a new dynamic slot named [meaning-of-life]. The logic within this slot specifies that when it is invoked, it returns the integer value 57 using [return-value].
 * 2. [signal] is then called with the argument [meaning-of-life], which triggers the execution of the previously defined dynamic slot. The result of this invocation is that the [signal] node will have the value 57 after execution.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically define and execute reusable logic blocks at runtime, such as business rules or calculations, without modifying the core application.
 * - Temporarily create a slot that provides a specific value (e.g., a configuration or secret) during the application's lifecycle, useful for testing or feature toggling.
 * - Simplify the process of returning fixed or computed results from a slot that needs to be invoked by other parts of a Hyperlambda workflow.
