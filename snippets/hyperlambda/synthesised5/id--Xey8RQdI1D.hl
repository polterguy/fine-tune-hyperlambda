/*
 * 1. The [join] slot is used to synchronize multiple asynchronous operations started by [fork] slots beneath it, ensuring that execution continues only after all child [fork] operations have completed.
 * 2. Each [fork] slot initiates a new thread of execution for its child logic, allowing the [http.get] requests to "https://gaiasoul.com" and "https://servergardens.com" to be performed concurrently.
 * 3. The result of each [fork], including the HTTP response from each [http.get] slot, is automatically merged back into the original execution context once all forks finish.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Efficiently retrieving data from multiple external APIs in parallel and waiting for all results before further processing.
 * - Speeding up batch HTTP requests where results from several endpoints are needed together.
 * - Performing simultaneous background processing tasks and aggregating their outputs in a single workflow.
