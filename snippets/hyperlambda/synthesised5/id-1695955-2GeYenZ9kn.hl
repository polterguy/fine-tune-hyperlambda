/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates multiple string values together to produce a single string result, building a SQL fragment in this context.
 * 2. [get-value] is used twice to retrieve the current value of [.sql] and the value of the [limit] argument from [.arguments], respectively.
 * 3. A static string node is included to insert the SQL clause " order by keyword_count desc, keyword_density desc limit " between the dynamic values.
 * 4. The final output is an updated SQL string that appends an ORDER BY clause and a limit value, using the provided arguments and previously built SQL.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically constructing SQL queries with variable ordering and limits based on input.
 * - Building paginated or sorted search results in a backend service.
 * - Generating custom SQL statements for analytics or reporting endpoints.
 * - Appending advanced query clauses to an existing base SQL statement.
