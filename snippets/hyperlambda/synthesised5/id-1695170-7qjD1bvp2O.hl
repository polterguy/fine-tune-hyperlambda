 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.system-message] node with content provided by its child slot.
 * 2. The [io.file.load] slot reads the content of the file located at "/modules/fine-tune-hyperlambda/system-message-synthesiser.md".
 * 3. The expression `:x:@.system-message` in [set-value] determines where the new value will be stored.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Dynamically load and update a system message in your application with content from a Markdown file.
 * - Prepare a context-specific system message before executing additional logic in a workflow.
 * - Refresh configuration or instructional text from external files without hardcoding them into your Hyperlambda.
