/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return data from a dynamic slot or endpoint. In this code, it is returning a node named [url].
 * 2. The [url] node's value is set using an expression: `:x:@data.select/*/*/id`. This expression navigates to all [id] nodes under all child nodes of [data.select].
 * 3. The `@data.select/*/*/id` expression will aggregate the [id] values from potentially multiple records returned by a previous [data.select] operation, packaging these into the [url] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a list of URLs or identifiers obtained from a SQL query executed via [data.select].
 * - Providing a set of IDs from query results to the client in a REST API endpoint.
 * - Passing identifiers to another slot or process for further action, such as batch processing or lookups.
