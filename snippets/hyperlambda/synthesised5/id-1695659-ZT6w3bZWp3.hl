/*
 * 1. The [add] slot dynamically appends nodes to multiple destination nodes, as specified by the expression `:x:+/*/*`. This means it targets all grandchildren of the current node's next sibling.
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all child nodes of the node referenced by [.dp], which is typically passed by reference in iteration contexts such as [for-each] or [include].
 * 3. The use of [get-nodes:x:@.dp/#/*] ensures that, for each iteration, the direct children of the referenced [.dp] node are gathered and then added to each destination node.
 * 
 * Possible use cases:
 * - Merging the children of multiple source nodes into several destination nodes during a data transformation process.
 * - Dynamically replicating a subtree from one part of the node graph into many locations, such as when cloning template structures into various sections.
 * - Aggregating configuration or data nodes from multiple sources into all target locations in a batch update scenario.
 * - Synchronizing nested child nodes between different parts of a hierarchical data structure during complex updates.
