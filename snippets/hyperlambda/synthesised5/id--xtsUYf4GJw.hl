/*
 * 1. The [sql.update] slot is used to generate and execute an SQL UPDATE statement on the database.
 * 2. The [table] node specifies the target table, in this case [table1], where the records will be updated.
 * 3. The [values] node contains the columns and their new values; here, [field1.eq] is being set to "howdy".
 * 4. By using [field1.eq] under [values], the code sets the value of the "field1" column to "howdy" for the selected rows.
 * 5. No [where] condition is provided, so the update applies to all records in [table1], which can be risky if not intended.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Mass updating a specific column ([field1]) for all rows in a table to a new value.
 * - Resetting a field across an entire table during data migration or cleanup.
 * - Applying a default value to a column for all records after a table schema change.
 * - Demonstrating the syntax of the [sql.update] slot for basic SQL operations in Hyperlambda.
 * - Cautionary example showing the importance of the [where] node to avoid unintended bulk updates.
