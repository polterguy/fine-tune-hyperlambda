/*
 * 1. The [get-name] slot retrieves the name of a node pointed to by its expression. In this case, the expression `:x:@.list/1` locates the second child node (index 1) of the [.list] node.
 * 2. The result is set as the value of the [.second-child-name] node, effectively storing the name of [.list]'s second child.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the name of a specific item in a collection represented as child nodes.
 * - Dynamically identifying node names for further processing or logging.
 * - Creating summaries or reports of node structures by accessing and storing child node names.
