/*
 * 1. The [add] slot appends new nodes as children to the target nodes obtained from the expression `:x:@data.connect/*/data.select`.
 * 2. Within [add], a single unnamed node (with the name ".") is created for each iterated node, and its value is set using the expression `:x:@.dp/#`, which de-references the current node being processed.
 * 3. The use of [.dp] within the [add] block means each child node added will contain the data of the currently iterated node by reference.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Aggregating and grouping multiple [data.select] result sets under their respective [data.connect] parents.
 * - Dynamically copying or referencing database query results into a new structure for further processing or export.
 * - Building composite data trees from multiple data sources by reusing existing nodes as child elements.
