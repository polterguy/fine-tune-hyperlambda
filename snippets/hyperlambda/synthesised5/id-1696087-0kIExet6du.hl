/*
 * 1. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple conditions together, ensuring all child expressions must be true for the [and] block to evaluate as true.
 * 2. The [leads.client_id:client_id.client_id] node specifies a join or comparison condition, indicating that the [client_id] column from the [leads] table must match the [client_id] column from the [client_id] table.
 * 3. This pattern is typically used within [on] clauses when constructing SQL joins, particularly inner or outer joins, to define how rows from two tables are related.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Joining the [leads] table to the [client_id] table so that only rows with matching [client_id] values are included.
 * - Constructing a where clause that filters results to those where [leads.client_id] equals [client_id.client_id].
 * - Defining foreign key relationships in dynamically generated SQL queries.
 * - Ensuring data integrity by only selecting records with existing related entries in both tables.
