/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to insert one or more new nodes into the graph at the location specified by the expression `:x:@for-each/@.dp/#/*/tables`. This means it targets the [tables] node that is a child of the node currently referenced by [.dp] within the result set produced by the [for-each] loop.
 * 
 * 2. The first child node inside [add] is an unnamed node (.), which acts as a container for the structure being added. Inside this container, there is another unnamed node (.), which contains the actual data to be inserted.
 * 
 * 3. The [name] node sets its value to the value extracted from the [table] child node of the currently referenced node within [.dp]. The expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/table` navigates from the current [for-each] data point and retrieves the [table] node's value.
 * 
 * 4. The [columns] node is added as a child under the second dot node, providing a placeholder or container for column-related data to be added later or populated dynamically.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Building a nested structure representing tables and their columns by iterating over a collection of table definitions and appending their details into a [tables] node.
 * - Dynamically constructing a data model from a set of database table metadata, creating named entries for each table and preparing containers for their respective columns.
 * - Populating a hierarchical tree of database schema information, where each table node is enriched with its name and an empty [columns] child node ready for further population.
