/*
 * 1. The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks if the currently authenticated user is a member of the "root" role, and will throw an exception if not.
 * 2. The [eval] slot with an expression of `:+` executes the next sibling node, allowing for execution flow control.
 * 3. The [return-nodes] slot returns the [version] node(s) as the endpoint response, without evaluating any expressions inside of [version].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Restricting access to an endpoint so only users in the "root" role can see system version information.
 * - Running additional logic after authentication by dynamically executing the next sibling node.
 * - Returning version data from an API endpoint as a structured response after confirming the user has the appropriate permissions.
