/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.sql`. This means it will look for the first node named [.sql] in the current context and return its value.
 * 2. The `:x:@.sql` expression is a lambda expression that navigates the node structure to find the target node named [.sql].
 * 3. This pattern is often used to extract a specific value from a previously defined node, enabling the reuse or inspection of data stored under [.sql].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the generated SQL statement from a [.sql] node after building or assembling SQL dynamically.
 * - Accessing configuration or query string data saved under [.sql] for further processing, logging, or debugging.
 * - Returning the value of a SQL command to a client or another part of a workflow for validation or execution.
 * - Passing the SQL value as an argument to another slot or function that expects a SQL string as input.
