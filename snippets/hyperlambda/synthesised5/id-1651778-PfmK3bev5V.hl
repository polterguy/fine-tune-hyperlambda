/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot checks if the node(s) referenced by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/question_id` exist and have a non-null value. If any referenced [question_id] node is missing or null, an exception is thrown, stopping further execution.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/question_id` allows validation of multiple [question_id] nodes under different children of [.arguments], ensuring all are present and non-null.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that a required [question_id] argument is provided in an HTTP endpoint before processing a request.
 * - Validating that all items in a batch operation have a [question_id] field supplied.
 * - Preventing execution of business logic if the [question_id] parameter is missing from user input.
