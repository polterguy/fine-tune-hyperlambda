/*
 * 1. The [data.read] slot initiates a database read operation, specifying that the [database-type] is SQLite.
 * 2. The [table] node selects the [EmployeeTerritories] table as the primary data source for the query.
 * 3. The [join] node under [table] performs a left join with the [Employees] table, using [EmployeeTerritories.EmployeeID] and [EmployeeID.EmployeeID] as the join condition. The [type:left] ensures all records from [EmployeeTerritories] are included, even if thereâ€™s no match in [Employees]. The [as:EmployeeID] node specifies an alias for the joined table.
 * 4. The [columns] node defines which columns or expressions to include in the result set. Here, [aggregate_functor] is selected and aliased as [result].
 * 5. The [where] node is included with an [and] condition, currently empty, acting as a placeholder for potential filtering logic.
 * 6. The [group] node groups the result set by [group_column], enabling aggregation based on this column.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Generating a report that summarizes data from [EmployeeTerritories] and related [Employees] records, grouped by a specific column.
 * - Performing aggregate calculations (such as COUNT, SUM, or custom aggregate functions) on employee territory data, with results grouped for analysis.
 * - Building a data export that includes all [EmployeeTerritories] entries, even if some employees are missing from the [Employees] table.
 * - Creating a dashboard widget that visualizes grouped employee territory metrics using aggregate functions.
 * - Auditing or troubleshooting territory assignments where the join ensures all territories are shown regardless of employee linkage.
