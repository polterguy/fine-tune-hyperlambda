/*
 * 1. The [io.file.execute] slot executes the Hyperlambda file located at "/system/openai/chat.get.hl". This allows you to run the logic defined in that file as if it were a dynamic slot, optionally passing arguments via an [.arguments] node.
 * 2. The specified file "/system/openai/chat.get.hl" is expected to contain Hyperlambda code, which will be executed in the current context. Any results or side effects produced by that file will be applied to the current execution tree.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically invoking a predefined OpenAI chat retrieval process from within another Hyperlambda script.
 * - Integrating external or modular business logic (such as chat history retrieval) into a larger workflow.
 * - Reusing complex logic stored in files across multiple endpoints or automation routines.
