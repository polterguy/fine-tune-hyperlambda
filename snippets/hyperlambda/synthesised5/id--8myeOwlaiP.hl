/*
 * 1. The [math.add] slot is used to add two integer values together. Here, it takes two static integer arguments, 20 and 7, and computes their sum.
 * 2. The result of the first [math.add] operation (which is 27) is then echoed as the value of another [math.add] node, explicitly setting its value to 27 with an integer type.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Summing two constants to verify basic arithmetic in a Hyperlambda script.
 * - Demonstrating how to work with static integer values using math slots.
 * - Preparing a reference value ([math.add:int:27]) for later conditional checks or comparisons in the code.
