/*
 * 1. The [while] slot initiates a loop that continues executing its body as long as the [lt] condition (less than) holds true.
 * 2. The [lt] slot evaluates whether the value of [.stock] is less than the integer 5, serving as the loop's condition.
 * 3. Inside the loop's body, the [add] slot appends a new unnamed node with the value "Restocking item" as a child to [.warehouse].
 * 4. The [math.increment] slot increases the value of [.stock] by 1 after each iteration.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically increase inventory until a minimum stock threshold is reached.
 * - Log each restocking action in the [.warehouse] node for process tracking.
 * - Demonstrate automatic replenishment logic in warehouse management systems.
 * - Illustrate how to perform batch actions with iterative logic in Hyperlambda.
