/*
 * 1. The [.textAlpha] node is assigned the value "demo" as a simple string.
 * 2. The [.textBeta] node demonstrates a string value containing a colon by using double quotes, which prevents parsing errors related to type/value separation.
 * 3. The [.textGamma] node shows how to define a multi-line string using the newline escape sequence `\n` inside double quotes, representing two logical lines in one value.
 * 4. The [.textDelta] node assigns the value "quotedText" without quotes, since the value contains no special characters or spaces, showing that plain strings don't require quoting.
 * 5. The [.textEpsilon] node uses double quotes to indicate a string value with an embedded newline (`\n`), splitting the content across two lines.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Storing configuration values that may contain special characters such as colons or newlines.
 * - Defining multi-line messages or content within a Hyperlambda file, such as email bodies or logs.
 * - Demonstrating the correct usage of quoting rules for string values in Hyperlambda to avoid misinterpretation by the parser.
 * - Preparing data nodes intended for further processing or output that require preservation of line breaks or formatting.
