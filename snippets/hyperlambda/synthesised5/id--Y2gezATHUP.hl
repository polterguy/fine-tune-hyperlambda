/*
 * 1. The [.src] node is assigned a value with the type [bytes] and a base64-encoded value "ICA=".
 * 2. The [convert] slot is invoked with an expression `:x:-`, which references the previous [.src] node.
 * 3. The [type] argument is set to "base64", instructing [convert] to convert the bytes from the previous node into a base64 string.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Decoding a base64-encoded byte array into its ASCII or binary representation.
 * - Preparing a file or binary input for transport over systems that require base64 encoding.
 * - Converting user-uploaded data from a base64 string to its raw binary form for processing.
 * - Handling API input where the payload is sent as base64-encoded bytes.
 * - Verifying that a given byte sequence corresponds to a valid base64 string before further processing.
