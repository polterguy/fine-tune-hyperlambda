/*
 * 1. The [set-name] slot is used here with the expression `:x:+/+/*/*`, which targets all nodes that are two sibling levels below the current node, then all their children, and then all their children again. It will change the names of all these nodes.
 * 2. The new name for each targeted node is generated by the [strings.concat] slot. This slot concatenates two values: the value of the [.p] node (referenced by .:@p), and the value of the [.no] node (retrieved by [get-value:x:@.no]).
 * 3. The [strings.concat] slot combines the value of [.p] and the value of [.no], and the result is used as the new name for each targeted node.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Dynamically rename multiple deeply nested nodes based on values from other nodes, such as combining a prefix and a number for unique identification.
 * - Bulk-update the names of nodes in a data structure to enforce a specific naming convention that includes values from sibling or parent nodes.
 * - Reorganize or standardize the names of nodes in a document or configuration tree based on contextual data.
