/*
 * 1. The [throw] slot is used to immediately raise an exception with the message "401 Unauthorized – Invalid or missing token". This will halt further execution and signal an error condition to the caller.
 * 2. By default, unless handled by a [.catch] block, this exception will propagate up and may result in an HTTP error response to the client, indicating that authentication has failed due to an invalid or missing token.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Enforcing authentication by rejecting requests that do not provide a valid JWT token.
 * - Returning a clear error message to clients attempting to access protected endpoints without proper authorization.
 * - Integrating with endpoint security logic to standardize unauthorized access responses.
