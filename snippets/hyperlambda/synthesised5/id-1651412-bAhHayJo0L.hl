/*
 * 1. The [mail.smtp.send] slot sends an email using SMTP. It takes a [server] node for SMTP connection details and a [message] node for the email content and recipients.
 * 2. The [server] node dynamically retrieves its [host], [port], [username], and [password] values using expressions that reference [config.get] and its children, allowing for flexible and potentially hierarchical configuration sourcing.
 * 3. The [message] node constructs the recipient ([to]) and sender information by extracting the [name] and [email] fields from the [.arguments] node, making the recipient details dynamic based on input arguments.
 * 4. The [subject] and [content] of the email are also dynamically set using expressions that reference the [.arguments] node, enabling the email subject and body to be customized at runtime.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Sending transactional emails where SMTP server credentials and recipient details are stored in configuration and passed in dynamically.
 * - Building a generic email-sending endpoint or automation that adapts to different users and SMTP servers without hardcoding credentials or message content.
 * - Integrating with workflows that require dynamic email notifications, where all relevant details are supplied as arguments or configuration values.
