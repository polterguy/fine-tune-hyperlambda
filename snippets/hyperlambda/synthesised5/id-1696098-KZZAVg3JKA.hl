/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot is used to retrieve the value of a node referenced by its expression argument.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.fields` points to the first node named [.fields] in the current execution context.
 * 3. When executed, this slot will return the value stored in the [.fields] node, which could be any data type supported by Hyperlambda (such as string, int, etc.).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting a submitted form's field values from a node named [.fields] for further processing.
 * - Accessing configuration data or settings that have been previously loaded into a [.fields] node.
 * - Passing the value of [.fields] to another slot for validation or transformation.
