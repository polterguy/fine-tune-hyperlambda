/*
 * 1. [get-value] is used to retrieve the value of a node or set of nodes.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@for-each/@.dp/#/*/hyperlambda_id` navigates through the tree structure to locate all [hyperlambda_id] nodes that are children of the node referenced by [for-each]'s [.dp] node, by reference.
 * 3. The [#] iterator is crucial here, as it dereferences the value of the [.dp] node, ensuring that any changes to the node are made by reference, not by value.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Extracting all [hyperlambda_id] values from a set of nodes currently being iterated over by [for-each].
 * - Collecting identifiers from each item in a data batch during processing.
 * - Validating or logging all [hyperlambda_id]s for audit or debugging purposes.
 * - Passing a list of IDs into another slot for further processing or transformation.
