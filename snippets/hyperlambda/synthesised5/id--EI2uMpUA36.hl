/*
 * 1. The [tasks.create] slot is used to define and persist a new task with the ID [foo-bar-task-3]. Inside its [.lambda] child, there is a [log.info] slot which logs the message "Executing foo-bar-task-3" each time the task executes.
 * 2. The [tasks.schedule] slot schedules the previously created [foo-bar-task-3] task for execution at a specific future date and time, provided via the [due] node as "2025-12-24T17:00:00.000" in UTC. This means the task will only execute once at the scheduled time.
 * 3. The [due] node under [tasks.schedule] specifies when the task should run, and it must be a valid UTC date in the future.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Schedule a notification or reminder to be sent at a specific future date, such as before a holiday.
 * - Automate tasks that should only run once at a precise time, like publishing content or triggering a backup.
 * - Queue up time-sensitive operations, such as sending a one-time report or alert.
