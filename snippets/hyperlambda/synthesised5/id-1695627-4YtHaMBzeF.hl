/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to send a real-time notification using the channel specified by the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/feedback-channel`. This means the specific feedback channel to signal is dynamically determined based on the value found in the [.arguments] node.
 * 2. The [args] child node provides the payload for the signal, including a [message] node with a string explanation about the file validation error, and a [type] node with the value "error", indicating the nature of the message.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Notifying a frontend client in real-time that a file upload did not meet URL list validation requirements.
 * - Sending targeted feedback to a user or group subscribed to a particular SignalR channel about input errors.
 * - Broadcasting error messages to specific connections or roles after server-side file validation fails during an import process.
 * - Providing immediate UI feedback in multi-user applications when shared resources do not meet expected data formats.
