/*
 * 1. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to broadcast a SignalR event named "northwind.Order Details.post" to all subscribers listening for this method.
 * 2. The [args] node is included as a child, which means any arguments placed within [args] will be serialized to JSON and sent as the payload of the signal. In this case, [args] is empty, so no additional data is transmitted.
 * 3. No [roles], [users], [groups], or [clients] nodes are specified, so the signal will be sent to all connected clients subscribed to "northwind.Order Details.post".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Notifying all connected clients in real-time when a new order detail is posted in a Northwind-style application.
 * - Broadcasting a generic event to update UI elements or trigger client-side logic when order details are added.
 * - Serving as a hook for other backend services or microservices to react to order detail changes without direct coupling.
