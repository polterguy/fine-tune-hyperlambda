/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to add nodes to a destination node. In this case, the destination is determined by the expression `:x:+/*/*`, which means it will add the nodes as children to the children of the next sibling of the current node.
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all nodes referenced by the expression `:x:@http.get/*/content/*`, which means it will fetch all child nodes of the [content] node that is a child of any child node of [http.get].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Merging the content retrieved from an HTTP GET request into another part of the node graph, such as appending HTTP response data to a different data structure.
 * - Dynamically injecting external data (like API responses) into the execution flow for further processing.
 * - Aggregating or transforming remote content by first retrieving it and then adding it to a specific location in the current node tree.
