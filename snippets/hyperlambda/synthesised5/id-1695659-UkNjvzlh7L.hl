/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression provided in its value argument.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.databaseType` navigates to the [.databaseType] node and extracts its value.
 * 3. The result of this operation will be the current value stored in the [.databaseType] node, which could be used as input for further logic or processing.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically determining the database type being used in a workflow for branching logic.
 * - Passing the value of [.databaseType] to another slot that requires this information, such as when establishing a database connection.
 * - Logging or auditing the current database type for diagnostic or monitoring purposes.
 * - Validating or enforcing constraints based on the active database type in a configuration or runtime context.
