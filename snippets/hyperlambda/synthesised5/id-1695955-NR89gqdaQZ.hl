/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression `:x:@.sql`. This means it will look for the first node named [.sql] in the current context and return its value.
 * 2. The `:x:@.sql` expression uses the "@" iterator to select the first node named [.sql] from the current scope, regardless of its position among siblings.
 * 3. The result of [get-value] will be the direct value of the [.sql] node, which could be a string, number, or any other data type stored in that node.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Useful when you need to extract the SQL query string or command stored in a [.sql] node for further processing or logging.
 * - Can be used as part of a larger workflow to dynamically retrieve and execute SQL statements defined elsewhere in your Hyperlambda graph.
 * - Helpful in debugging or templating scenarios where the SQL statement is generated or modified before being accessed.
