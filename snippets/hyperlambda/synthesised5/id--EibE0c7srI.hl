/*
 * 1. The [http.post] slot sends an HTTP POST request to the URL "https://api.example.com/data".
 * 2. The [payload] node provides the body of the POST request, which in this case is a JSON string containing a "query" parameter with the value "status".
 * 3. The [convert] node is set to true, instructing the slot to automatically convert the response content to a corresponding Hyperlambda or object format if a suitable converter is available.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Querying the status of a remote API service and directly receiving a structured response.
 * - Interacting with external RESTful endpoints that require JSON input and return JSON data.
 * - Automating integration scenarios where results from an external system need to be processed within a Hyperlambda workflow.
 * - Submitting search or filter criteria to a backend and easily consuming the resulting dataset.
