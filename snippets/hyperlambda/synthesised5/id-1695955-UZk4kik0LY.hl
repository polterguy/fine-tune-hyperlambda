/*
 * 1. The [data.select] slot executes a SQL query whose text is retrieved from the [.sql] node in the current execution tree, allowing dynamic selection of the query to run.
 * 2. The [database-type] argument is set to "sqlite", ensuring the query is executed using an SQLite database connection, regardless of any global or default database type settings.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Running custom or user-generated SQL queries specified in a [.sql] node against an SQLite database for dynamic reporting or data analysis.
 * - Implementing a generic query endpoint that supports different database types by changing the [database-type] argument as needed.
 * - Testing or debugging SQL statements on an SQLite instance by programmatically injecting different SQL into [.sql].
