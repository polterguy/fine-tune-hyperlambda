/*
 * 1. [set-value]: Updates the value of the [.time] node with the result from its child operation.
 * 2. [math.subtract]: Calculates the difference between two values, specifically subtracting the value of [.begin] from [.end].
 * 3. [get-value]: Retrieves the values of the [.end] and [.begin] nodes for use in the subtraction.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Calculating the duration between two timestamps, storing the result in [.time].
 * - Determining the elapsed time for a process by subtracting a start time from an end time.
 * - Computing the difference between two numeric values and saving the result for further workflow processing.
 * - Useful in reporting or analytics to measure time intervals between events.
