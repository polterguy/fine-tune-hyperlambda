/*
 * 1. The [config.get] slot retrieves a configuration value from the application's configuration file (such as appsettings.json) using the specified key.
 * 2. In this case, the key is "mail.smtp.password", so the slot will return the value associated with this key, which is typically the SMTP password used for sending emails.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the SMTP password at runtime to authenticate with an SMTP server when sending emails.
 * - Dynamically retrieving sensitive configuration values without hardcoding them in your Hyperlambda code.
 * - Using the retrieved password as part of a [mail.smtp.send] invocation to send emails securely.
