/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.sql] node, setting it to the result of the [strings.concat] operation.
 * 2. The [strings.concat] slot takes a sequence of values and concatenates them into a single string. Here, it combines the current value of [.sql], the static string " offset ", and the value of the [offset] argument from [.arguments].
 * 3. [get-value] is used twice to retrieve the current value of [.sql] and the value of the [offset] argument, ensuring the concatenated string is dynamically constructed based on the latest state.
 * 
 * Typical use cases:
 * - Dynamically appending an SQL OFFSET clause to an existing query string stored in [.sql], based on incoming arguments.
 * - Modifying a query string before execution to implement pagination in a data API.
 * - Constructing custom SQL statements where query parts are built up in separate steps, ensuring the offset is only added if required by client input.
