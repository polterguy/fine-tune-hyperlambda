/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used here with an expression `:x:@.fields`, indicating it will add together the values of all child nodes found under the [.fields] node.
 * 2. A child node is provided with an expression `:x:@strings.concat`, which means before performing the addition, each value from [.fields] will be passed through [strings.concat].
 * 3. [strings.concat] will concatenate its input values into a single string for each child node under [.fields], so the addition will operate on concatenated string values rather than the original field values.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Summing the combined string values of multiple fields after joining sub-elements for each field.
 * - Creating a comma-separated or otherwise concatenated value for each field before performing a collective operation.
 * - Aggregating user input from multiple form fields into a single string and then performing math or further string processing.
 * - Preparing data for export or reporting by merging and then adding field values.
