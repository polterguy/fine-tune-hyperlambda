/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot targets all nodes that match the expression `:x:@signal/*/*/db/=model`, which means it will locate all [db] child nodes of any child node under any child node of [signal], but only those [db] nodes with a value exactly equal to "model".
 * 2. Every node identified by this expression is deleted from the structure, effectively cleaning up or filtering out specific [db] nodes that meet the value condition.
 * 3. The operation could be used to sanitize, prune, or restructure the data tree by eliminating all [db] nodes holding the "model" value, possibly to prevent duplication, enforce data consistency, or prepare the tree for further processing.
 * 
 * Short use cases:
 * - Removing sensitive or unwanted "model" references from a nested configuration or data import after a batch operation.
 * - Cleaning up a dynamically built signal tree by discarding all [db] nodes with the value "model" after data migration.
 * - Preparing a structure for serialization by removing nodes that should not be persisted or transmitted.
