 * 1. The [return] slot immediately ends execution of the current lambda and returns the specified nodes to the caller.
 * 2. The [result] node is created as a child of [return] and its value is set to "No records found".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a response from an HTTP endpoint when a database query yields no results.
 * - Providing a default message in a workflow when a search or filter operation finds no matching records.
 * - Early exit from a function or dynamic slot when a required condition is not met, informing the caller that no data is available.
