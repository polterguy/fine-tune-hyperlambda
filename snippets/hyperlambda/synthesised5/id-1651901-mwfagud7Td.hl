/*
 * 1. The [throw] slot raises an exception with the message "Database already exists".
 * 2. The [public] child node is set to boolean true, which means the exception message will be returned to the client, even in release builds, unless a [.catch] block handles it first.
 * 3. The [status] child node sets the HTTP response status code to 400, indicating a client error (Bad Request).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a clear error to the client when attempting to create a database that already exists.
 * - Enforcing business logic by preventing duplicate database creation and informing the client accordingly.
 * - Integrating with client-side error handling that expects specific HTTP status codes for validation errors.
