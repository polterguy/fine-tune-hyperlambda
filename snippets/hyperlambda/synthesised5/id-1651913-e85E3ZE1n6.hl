/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates a list of strings and values into a single string.
 * 2. The [.:"pragma index_info('"] node adds the literal string "pragma index_info('" to the result.
 * 3. The [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/name] slot retrieves the value of the [name] child node from the node referenced by [.dp], which is expected to be passed in by reference.
 * 4. The [.:"')"] node appends the literal string "')" to the result.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Generating a SQL statement to retrieve index information for a specific table or index whose name is dynamically provided.
 * - Building dynamic SQL queries based on metadata from a set of nodes representing database objects.
 * - Automating database introspection tasks where the index name is determined at runtime.
