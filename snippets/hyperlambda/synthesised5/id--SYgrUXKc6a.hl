/*
 * 1. The [.data] node contains two child nodes, [foo1] and [foo2].
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot is invoked with the expression `:x:-/*`, which retrieves all children of the previous sibling node (in this case, [.data]'s children).
 * 3. The [get-nodes] slot returns both [foo1] and [foo2] nodes as its result, preserving their structure and values.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Accessing a collection of sibling nodes for further processing or iteration.
 * - Duplicating or inspecting a node set within a workflow.
 * - Passing multiple nodes as input to another slot or operation that requires a set of nodes.
