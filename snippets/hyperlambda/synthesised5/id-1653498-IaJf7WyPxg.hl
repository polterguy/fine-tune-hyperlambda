/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return values from a dynamic slot or endpoint. In this case, it returns a node named [affected_records].
 * 2. The [affected_records] node's value is set using an expression `:x:@data.update`, which retrieves the value from the [data.update] node in the current execution context.
 * 3. This construct is typically used after performing a database update operation, where [data.update] holds the count of records affected by the update.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning the number of rows updated in a database operation to the caller of an API endpoint.
 * - Providing feedback to a client application about how many records were modified after a bulk update.
 * - Logging or auditing the result of an update operation by capturing the affected record count.
