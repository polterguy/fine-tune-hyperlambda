/*
 * 1. [if] checks if [.auto_destruct] exists and is truthy before proceeding, acting as a conditional guard for the entire workflow.
 * 2. [sockets.signal] sends a message to the feedback channel, notifying that a scheduled task will be created to delete a chatbot in 7 days. The message and type are provided as arguments.
 * 3. [sleep] pauses execution for 100 milliseconds, likely to ensure message delivery or sequencing.
 * 4. [math.add] calculates a date 7 days in the future by adding 7 days to the current date/time ([date.now] and [time] with [days:7]).
 * 5. [strings.concat] constructs a unique task name by concatenating "delete-chatbot-" with the value of [.type].
 * 6. [unwrap] is used to extract values from sibling nodes, specifically the task name and type, for later use in the task definition.
 * 7. [tasks.create] creates a new scheduled task with the generated name, a description, and a due date set to 7 days in the future. The task's lambda defines the deletion logic:
 *    - Sets [.type] to the current type value.
 *    - Connects to a database and executes a SQL statement to delete training snippets of the given type.
 *    - Sets [.task] to the task name.
 *    - Connects to the database again to delete the corresponding type from the [ml_types] table.
 *    - Deletes an HTML file associated with the chatbot type from the web directory.
 *    - Logs an informational message indicating the chatbot was deleted.
 *    - Deletes the scheduled task itself using [tasks.delete] to ensure it does not run again.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically schedule the deletion of a demo chatbot and all its related data and files 7 days after creation, ensuring cleanup of temporary resources.
 * - Provide users with feedback that a chatbot will be deleted in the future, giving them time to act if needed.
 * - Implement self-destructing demo environments or resources for security, compliance, or cost-saving purposes.
