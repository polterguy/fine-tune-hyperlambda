/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used here with the destination expression `:x:@.parent`, targeting the [.parent] node.
 * 2. Each child node (child1, child2, child3) is defined as a direct argument under [add]. Their values are set to "child 1's value", "child 2's value", and "child 3's value" respectively.
 * 3. When [add] executes, it appends all these child nodes as children to the [.parent] node, extending its children collection.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically building up a node tree by adding new child nodes under an existing parent node.
 * - Programmatically populating a configuration or data structure in Hyperlambda by adding multiple entries at once.
 * - Generating a set of related items (e.g., menu options, form fields) under a common parent node in preparation for further processing or output.
