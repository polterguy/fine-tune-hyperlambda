/*
 * 1. The [.src] node is created with two children nodes containing the values "foo" and "bar".
 * 2. The [strings.join] slot is invoked with an expression `:x:@.src/*` which targets all children of the [.src] node.
 * 3. A separator value of "," is given to [strings.join] as a child node, instructing it to use a comma between the joined strings.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Combine an array of names or values into a single CSV-like string.
 * - Convert a list of tags into a comma-separated string for display or storage.
 * - Generate delimited lists for configuration files or export routines.
 * - Format a sequence of strings for human-readable output.
