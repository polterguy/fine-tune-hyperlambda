/*
 * 1. The [or] slot is used to evaluate multiple conditions and will return true if at least one of its child conditions evaluates to true.
 * 2. The [null] slot checks if the result of the expression `:x:@cache.get` is null, returning true if it is.
 * 3. The [eq] slot compares the value retrieved by `:x:@cache.get` to an empty value, returning true if they are exactly equal.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Determining if a cached item is either missing (null) or empty.
 * - Validating cache retrieval to trigger fallback logic if the cache does not contain meaningful data.
 * - Implementing conditional logic that handles both null and empty cache states in a single step.
 * - Ensuring that further processing only occurs if valid, non-empty cache data is present.
