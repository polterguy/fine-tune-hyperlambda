/*
 * 1. [pgsql.connect] establishes a connection to the "ecommerce" PostgreSQL database, ensuring that all subsequent database operations are executed within this context.
 * 2. [pgsql.update] performs an update operation on the [products] table, modifying records based on the supplied criteria.
 * 3. [values] specifies the column(s) and new value(s) to be set, in this case updating the [price] column to the decimal value 19.99.
 * 4. [where] defines the filtering conditions for the update, here using an [and] clause to require that only records where [product_id] is equal to the integer 202 are affected.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Updating the price of a specific product in an online store after a discount is applied.
 * - Correcting a pricing error for a single product in inventory management.
 * - Dynamically adjusting product prices as part of a scheduled promotion for specific items.
 * - Synchronizing product data from an external pricing service for a single product.
