/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot is used to open a connection to the [inventory_db] database, ensuring all inner database operations use this connection.
 * 2. The [database-type] node inside [data.connect] specifies that the connection should use MySQL as the underlying database engine.
 * 3. The [data.read] slot, nested within [data.connect], performs a read (SELECT) operation on the database.
 * 4. The [database-type] node inside [data.read] reinforces that the read operation should use MySQL-specific syntax and features.
 * 5. The [table] node within [data.read] specifies that records will be selected from the [products] table.
 * 
 * Short use cases:
 * - Retrieve all product records from the [products] table in a MySQL-based inventory database.
 * - Use as a base structure for more advanced queries, such as filtering or joining product data.
 * - Adapt the code to select specific columns or implement pagination by adding [columns], [limit], or [offset] nodes.
 * - Integrate within a transaction block for safe batch reads or updates in inventory management routines.
