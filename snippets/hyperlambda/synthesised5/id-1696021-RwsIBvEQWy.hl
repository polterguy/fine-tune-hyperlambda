/*
 * 1. [add] is invoked with an expression `:x:./*/data.read`, which means it will add the nodes specified by its children right after all sibling nodes named [data.read] at the same hierarchy level.
 * 2. [get-nodes] is used twice to fetch all nodes referenced by the expressions `:x:@.arguments/*/order` and `:x:@.arguments/*/direction`. These expressions retrieve any [order] and [direction] nodes under [.arguments] and supply them as children to the [add] operation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically append user-specified sorting or ordering parameters after data retrieval nodes in a data processing pipeline.
 * - Insert metadata about sorting criteria directly into a response or processing tree after the data read step.
 * - Add multiple configuration nodes (such as [order] and [direction]) into a workflow, ensuring they appear together immediately following the data acquisition logic.
