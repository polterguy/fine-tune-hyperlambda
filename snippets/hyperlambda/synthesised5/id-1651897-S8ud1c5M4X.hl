/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot assigns a new value to the [.sql] node. The value is constructed by concatenating several string segments.
 * 2. The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate the SQL command parts into a single string.
 * 3. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [.arguments] node's [tableName] and [columnName] children, inserting them into the SQL statement.
 * 4. The resulting value in [.sql] will be a string in the format: `alter table [tableName] drop column [columnName];`, where [tableName] and [columnName] are dynamically provided by the user.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically generating a SQL statement to drop a column from a database table based on user input.
 * - Automating schema modifications in a database management tool.
 * - Building a backend API endpoint that allows administrators to remove columns from tables by specifying table and column names.
