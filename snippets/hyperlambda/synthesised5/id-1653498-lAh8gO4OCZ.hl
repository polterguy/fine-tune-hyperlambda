/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot checks if the node specified by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/CarrierID` exists and has a non-null value. If the [CarrierID] node is missing or its value is null, an exception is thrown, preventing further execution.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/CarrierID` targets all [CarrierID] nodes that are direct children of any child node under [.arguments], allowing validation of multiple [CarrierID] nodes if present.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that a required [CarrierID] argument is provided in an HTTP endpoint before processing a request.
 * - Validating input data in a workflow where [CarrierID] must always be specified.
 * - Preventing execution of business logic if the [CarrierID] value is missing from user input or API calls.
