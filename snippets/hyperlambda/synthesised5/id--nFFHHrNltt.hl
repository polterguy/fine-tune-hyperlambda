/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node sets up the expected arguments for the HTTP endpoint, ensuring only allowed arguments are accepted during invocation.
 * 2. The [request.ip] slot retrieves the client's IP address making the HTTP request.
 * 3. The [yield] slot outputs a response node, in this case creating a node named [ip] whose value is set dynamically by referencing the value obtained from [request.ip] using the expression `:x:@request.ip`.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Building an endpoint that returns the IP address of the client for logging or analytics.
 * - Creating a simple diagnostic or debugging endpoint to verify what IP address the backend sees for the client.
 * - Enabling client-specific logic by extracting and returning the requestorâ€™s IP as part of a workflow.
 * - Providing a utility endpoint for users to check their own public IP address as seen by the server.
