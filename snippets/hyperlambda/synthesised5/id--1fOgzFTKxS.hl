/*
 * 1. The [try] slot attempts to execute the Hyperlambda code inside its lambda block, which tries to open a database connection to [invalid_database] using MySQL as specified by the [database-type] argument.
 * 2. If an exception occurs during the connection attempt, the [.catch] block is triggered, and the [log.error] slot logs the error message from [.arguments]/*/message.
 * 3. Regardless of success or failure, the [.finally] block is always executed, where [log.info] writes an informational log entry stating the database connection attempt has finished.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Handling database connection failures gracefully while ensuring error messages are logged for monitoring.
 * - Guaranteeing that a log entry about the completion of the connection attempt is always made, even if an exception occurs.
 * - Providing clear separation of error-handling and cleanup logic by using [.catch] and [.finally] blocks within a Hyperlambda workflow.
 * - Useful for robust automation scripts that interact with databases and require traceability of connection issues.
