/*
 * 1. The [strings.trim] slot is used to remove specified characters from both the beginning and end of a string.
 * 2. The main node contains the value "??hello??", and the child node provides the character "?" as the set of characters to trim.
 * 3. When executed, this slot will trim all leading and trailing "?" characters from "??hello??", resulting in the string "hello".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up user input that may have unwanted padding characters on either side.
 * - Removing formatting or delimiter characters from strings before further processing.
 * - Standardizing data by ensuring no extraneous characters remain at the start or end of a value.
