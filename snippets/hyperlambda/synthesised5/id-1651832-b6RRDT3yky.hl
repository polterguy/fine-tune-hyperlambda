/*
 * 1. The [validators.mandatory] slot is used to ensure that a required argument is present in the input data. If the specified argument is missing, an exception will be thrown.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.arguments/*/delay` targets all [delay] nodes that are children of any child node of [.arguments], allowing validation of multiple [delay] arguments at once.
 * 3. This slot is typically used at the beginning of an endpoint or function to enforce that essential parameters are provided before further processing occurs.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that a [delay] argument is always supplied when invoking an API endpoint that requires a delay parameter.
 * - Validating multiple [delay] arguments in a batch operation, where each item must specify its own delay value.
 * - Preventing execution of business logic if the required [delay] input is omitted, thereby improving input data integrity.
