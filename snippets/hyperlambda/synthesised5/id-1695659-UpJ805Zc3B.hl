/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot is used to delete nodes from the current execution tree.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@signal/*/*/db/=template1` targets all nodes named [db] that are children of any node two levels under [signal], but only those [db] nodes whose value is "template1".
 * 3. When [remove-nodes] is executed, all referenced [db] nodes that meet this criteria are permanently removed from the node structure.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Removing database configuration nodes with a specific template under a signal processing workflow.
 * - Cleaning up nodes that match a given value in nested structures before further processing.
 * - Dynamically pruning data to prevent specific nodes from being processed downstream.
 * - Implementing conditional deletion of elements based on template matching within complex execution trees.
