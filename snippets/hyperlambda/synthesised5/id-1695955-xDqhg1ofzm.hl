/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@.fields`. This means it finds the first node named [.fields] in the current context and returns its value.
 * 2. The expression uses `@.fields` to locate the [.fields] node, regardless of its position in the hierarchy, as long as it is accessible from the current execution scope.
 * 3. The result of [get-value] will be the actual data stored as the value of [.fields], not the node or its children.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting user-submitted form data stored as the value of [.fields].
 * - Fetching a configuration or settings string from a node named [.fields] during workflow processing.
 * - Using the returned value in further computation, validation, or as input for another slot.
