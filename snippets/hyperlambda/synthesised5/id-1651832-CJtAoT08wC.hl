/*
 * 1. The [validators.integer] slot validates that the value(s) referenced by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/threshold` are integers and, if provided, checks them against the specified constraints.
 * 2. The [min] child node sets the minimum allowed value for the integer(s) to 25. If any referenced [threshold] value is less than 25, an exception will be thrown.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that a user-supplied threshold parameter in an API request is at least 25.
 * - Validating configuration values to prevent setting a threshold below an acceptable operational minimum.
 * - Enforcing business logic where a minimum threshold value is required for calculations or processing.
