/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot is used here to establish a connection to a database.
 * 2. The value `[generic|database]` specifies which connection string (from configuration) to use ("generic") and which database to connect to ("database").
 * 3. After this slot executes, any subsequent database operations within its scope will utilize this open connection.
 * 4. The connection will automatically close when execution leaves the scope of the [data.connect] node.
 * 5. This slot serves as the entry point for executing SQL operations like queries, inserts, updates, or transactions within the context of the specified database.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Reading records from a specific database using predefined connection parameters.
 * - Performing multiple related SQL operations inside a single, managed connection context.
 * - Executing transactions or batch updates that require an explicit and controlled database connection.
 * - Connecting to different databases dynamically by changing the connection string and database names as needed.
