 * 1. The [add] slot appends nodes to the destination node(s) specified by the expression in its value. In this case, the destination is determined by the `:+` expression, which refers to the next sibling node(s) after the current node.
 * 2. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all child nodes of the [.arguments] node using the `:x:@.arguments/*` expression. These nodes are then provided as the source nodes to be added.
 * 3. The result is that all children of [.arguments] are appended as children to the next sibling node(s) after the current node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically transfer input arguments into another node's children collection for further processing.
 * - Aggregate user-provided data into a result node in an HTTP endpoint.
 * - Clone or move configuration nodes from an input section to a processing section in a workflow.
