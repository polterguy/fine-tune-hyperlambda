/*
 * 1. The [strings.length] slot is used to determine the number of characters in a string. In this example, it calculates the length of the string value assigned, which is "你好".
 * 2. When executed, [strings.length] returns an integer indicating how many characters the input string contains, regardless of whether those characters are ASCII, Unicode, or multi-byte.
 * 3. This slot is useful for dynamic string processing, such as validating input lengths, counting characters for display or storage constraints, or preparing data for further processing.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Validating that a username or password entered by a user does not exceed a maximum character limit, even for multi-language input.
 * - Dynamically calculating the length of user-provided text in multilingual applications to support proper UI rendering.
 * - Counting the number of characters in a string before performing substring operations or database storage to ensure data fits within required field sizes.
