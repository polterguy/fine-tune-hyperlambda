/*
 * 1. The [data.update] slot is used to update records in a database table, in this case the [Customers] table.
 * 2. The [database-type] node specifies that the database is of type "sqlite".
 * 3. The [table] node indicates the target table for the update operation, which is [Customers].
 * 4. The [values] node is where you specify the columns and their new values to be updated. In this example, no fields are provided, so you would need to add child nodes under [values] for each column you want to update.
 * 5. The [where] node, with an [and] child, is used to define the conditions that must be met for records to be updated. Additional conditions should be added as children of [and] to prevent updating all records unintentionally.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Updating a customer's email address in the [Customers] table where the customer's ID matches a specific value.
 * - Changing the status of multiple customers who meet certain criteria (e.g., all customers from a specific city).
 * - Bulk updating customer records after a data migration, with conditions to target only affected rows.
