/*
 * 1. The [mysql.connect] slot establishes a connection to the database identified as "sakila".
 * 2. The [mysql.scalar] slot executes the SQL command `select count(*) from actor` against the connected database, retrieving only a single aggregate value (the total number of rows in the "actor" table).
 * 3. The [yield] slot returns a node named [actor-count], setting its value to the result of the [mysql.scalar] slot by referencing it with the expression `:x:@mysql.scalar`.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Quickly determining the total number of actors in the "sakila" database for reporting or dashboard purposes.
 * - Returning a summary count from a database as part of an API endpoint.
 * - Simplifying the retrieval of aggregate values, such as counts, sums, or averages, from a MySQL database without returning full result sets.
