/*
 * 1. [for-each]: The first [for-each] iterates over all child nodes of any [.foo1] node found one level up in the hierarchy, targeting nodes like [bar1], [bar2], and [bar3]. For each such node, it sets [.dp] by reference to the current node.
 * 2. [for-each]: The nested [for-each] iterates through all children of the currently referenced [.dp] node, so for example, if [.dp] is [bar1], it iterates over [sub1] and [sub2].
 * 3. [log.info]: For every child node encountered in the innermost loop, [log.info] records a log entry with the message "For each executed".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Logging every subnode under all children of a specific node for debugging or auditing.
 * - Processing or transforming hierarchical data structures by recursively iterating through multiple levels.
 * - Collecting statistics or performing actions on deeply nested nodes within a graph-like data model.
 * - Validating presence or structure of subnodes within complex objects.
