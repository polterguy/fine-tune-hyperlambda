/*
 * 1. The [return-nodes] slot is used to return one or more nodes from within a dynamically created slot or a context that supports explicit node returns. It will return all its child nodes as the result.
 * 2. The [databases] node is included as a child of [return-nodes], which means it will be part of the returned node set when the dynamic slot is executed.
 * 3. When this code is invoked inside a dynamic slot, the node structure rooted at [databases] will be passed back to the caller, making it possible to return complex node trees instead of just single values.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a list of available databases from a custom dynamic slot.
 * - Building an endpoint that needs to provide structured node data as its output.
 * - Creating a reusable dynamic slot that wraps and returns results from internal processes in a node format.
