/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node (or nodes) referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`.
 * 2. The expression `@.fields` points to the first node named [.fields] at the same level or higher in the current lambda execution tree.
 * 3. When executed, [get-value] will evaluate the expression, find the [.fields] node, and return its value (not its children or structure, just the value).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the value of a [.fields] node that contains user input or configuration data within a workflow.
 * - Accessing the current set of fields in a form submission processing pipeline.
 * - Dynamically retrieving information from [.fields] to use as input for further processing or validation steps.
 * - Passing the value of [.fields] to another slot or for conditional checks elsewhere in your lambda flow.
