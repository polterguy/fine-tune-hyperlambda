/*
 * 1. The [sql.read] slot initiates a SQL SELECT query on the [table1] table, retrieving data according to the provided arguments.
 * 2. The [limit] node is set to -1, which disables the default limit of 25 records, allowing the query to return all matching rows without restriction.
 * 3. The [where] clause adds filtering logic for the query.
 * 4. Inside [where], the [and] node aggregates multiple conditions (here, only one), ensuring all must be true for a record to be returned.
 * 5. The [field1.eq] node acts as a comparison operator, restricting results to rows where the [field1] column equals "howdy".
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Retrieve every row from [table1] where [field1] is exactly "howdy", regardless of total result count.
 * - Export all database entries with a specific [field1] value for downstream processing.
 * - Perform data analysis or batch updates on an entire filtered data set without pagination.
 * - Audit or migrate data matching certain criteria from [table1].
