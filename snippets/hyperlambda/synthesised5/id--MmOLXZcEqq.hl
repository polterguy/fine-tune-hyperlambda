/*
 * 1. The [strings.mixin] slot is used to create a string where the result of an inline Hyperlambda expression is dynamically inserted into the string at runtime.
 * 2. Inside the string, `{{ ... }}` delimits an inline Hyperlambda block. Here, [date.now] is invoked to retrieve the current date and time.
 * 3. The [return] slot with the value `:x:-` returns the result of the previous node, which in this case is the value produced by [date.now].
 * 4. The final result of [strings.mixin] is a string that includes the current date and time embedded directly within the text "Current year is ...".
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Dynamically display the current date and time in a UI label or notification.
 * - Generate a timestamped message for logging or auditing purposes.
 * - Provide real-time contextual information in a template-based email or report.
 * - Render system status messages that include the current server time.
