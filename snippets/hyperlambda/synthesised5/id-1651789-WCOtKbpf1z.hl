/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot is used to delete nodes from the current lambda object.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@json2lambda/*/magic/*/auth/*/recaptcha` targets all [recaptcha] nodes that are descendants of any [auth] node, which in turn are descendants of any [magic] node, all under the [json2lambda] node.
 * 3. When executed, all [recaptcha] nodes matching this path will be removed from the lambda object, including their children if they have any.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up sensitive or unnecessary [recaptcha] configuration data from a lambda object after importing JSON.
 * - Removing authentication-related [recaptcha] nodes before exporting or serializing the object for environments where recaptcha is not needed.
 * - Dynamically pruning parts of a configuration or data structure for testing, security, or deployment purposes.
