/*
 * 1. The [auth.ticket.verify] slot is verifying the authentication ticket for the "root" user before executing the rest of the logic, ensuring the caller is authorized.
 * 2. The [validators.mandatory] slots make sure that both [.type] and [.user] exist under [.arguments], throwing exceptions if either argument is missing.
 * 3. The [data.connect] slot establishes a database connection to either the "generic" or "magic" data source.
 * 4. The [add] slot dynamically appends all argument nodes from [.arguments] into the [and] clause of the [where] filter for the subsequent [data.delete] operation.
 * 5. The [data.delete] slot deletes records from the [users_extra] table where all conditions (based on the provided arguments) match.
 * 6. The [unwrap] slot executes the node following [data.connect] (i.e., the [data.delete] operation) and returns its result.
 * 7. The [return] slot outputs the number of affected rows from the [data.delete] operation in an [affected] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Implementing an endpoint for administrators to bulk-delete user-related records from the [users_extra] table based on supplied criteria.
 * - Enforcing strong argument validation and authentication for sensitive database operations.
 * - Providing an audit-friendly mechanism by only allowing root users to execute deletions with explicit arguments.
 * - Allowing flexible filtering by dynamically constructing the [where] clause based on incoming HTTP parameters.
