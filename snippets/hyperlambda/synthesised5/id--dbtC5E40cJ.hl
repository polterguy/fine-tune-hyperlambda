/*
 * 1. The [.maxCount] node is declared with the type "ushort" and assigned a value of 123. This means the node's value is stored as an unsigned 16-bit integer, ensuring it can only contain non-negative whole numbers between 0 and 65535.
 * 2. Typing the node as "ushort" allows for strict type checking and interoperability with strongly typed slots or external systems expecting a specific data type.
 * 3. The use of the period prefix in [.maxCount] signals that this node is intended as a data node, not a slot to be executed.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Defining a maximum allowable count in a pagination or batching routine.
 * - Setting an upper limit for a numeric input field in a form validation logic.
 * - Providing configuration for resource limits such as the number of concurrent processes or items in an operation.
