/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is used to append a new node to the node set found by the expression `:x:@.fields`.  
 * 2. The child node `.` contains a value that is an expression, `:x:@strings.concat`, which means it will reference the node named [strings.concat] at the current scope and use its value when evaluated.
 * 3. This pattern allows you to dynamically add a new entry to [.fields] where the value is linked to the result of [strings.concat].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically building a collection of fields for further processing where some fields are outputs of string concatenation operations.
 * - Creating a set of output fields in a data transformation pipeline, where certain fields need to contain concatenated strings.
 * - Augmenting a configuration or data schema by programmatically referencing the result of [strings.concat] for specific fields.
