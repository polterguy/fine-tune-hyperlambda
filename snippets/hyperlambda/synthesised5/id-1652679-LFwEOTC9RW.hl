/*
 * 1. The [yield] slot is used to return data from a dynamic slot, file, or HTTP endpoint. It evaluates its child nodes and returns them as the result of the execution.
 * 2. The [books] node is created as a child of [yield], and its value is set to the result of the expression `:x:@data.read/*`, which means it collects all child nodes of the [data.read] node and returns them as the value of [books].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Returning a list of book records from a data source in response to an API call.
 * - Wrapping the results of a database or file read operation inside a [books] node for standardized output.
 * - Providing a collection of items under a named node for further processing or client consumption.
