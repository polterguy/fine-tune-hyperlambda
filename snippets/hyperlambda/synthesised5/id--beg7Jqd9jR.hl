/*
 * 1. The [null] slot checks if the result of the given expression is null or contains no nodes, returning true in such cases and false otherwise.
 * 2. The first [null] invocation, `null:x:@.src1/*`, evaluates the children of [.src1]; since [.src1] contains a child node [foo] with a value, this will return false.
 * 3. The second [null] invocation, `null:x:@.src2/*`, evaluates the children of [.src2]; since [.src2] contains a [foo] node without a value, but the node still exists, this will also return false because the node is present, even if it has a null value. The [null] slot checks for existence, not the value of the node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Determine if a collection node has any children before proceeding with further processing.
 * - Validate data structures to ensure required nodes are present.
 * - Implement conditional logic that only executes if a set of nodes is empty or missing.
