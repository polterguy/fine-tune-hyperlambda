/*
 * 1. The [include] slot executes the children nodes of the [data.read] node and makes the results available in the current context.
 * 2. The [data.read] slot queries the "Course" table and selects the "CourseId" and "Title" columns.
 * 3. The [where] clause filters the results to only include courses where the "ProfessorId" matches the value found at the expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/ProfessorId`.
 * 4. The [yield] slot returns the resulting course records as a node named [courses], containing the output of the [data.read] operation.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieve all courses taught by a specific professor, where the professor's ID is dynamically determined from the current context.
 * - Include course information as part of a larger data aggregation or API response for a professor entity.
 * - Filter and return only relevant course data associated with a given professor in a workflow or report generation process.
