 * 1. The [.now] node is created as a placeholder for storing the current date and time.
 * 2. The [set-value] slot is used to update the value of the [.now] node.
 * 3. The [date.now] slot retrieves the current UTC date and time, which is then assigned as the value of the [.now] node using [set-value].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Capture the current timestamp for logging or auditing actions within a workflow.
 * - Store the time a particular event or process started for later calculation of durations.
 * - Record the current date and time before performing a series of operations that require time-based validation or scheduling.
