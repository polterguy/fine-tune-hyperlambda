/*
 * 1. The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate multiple string values into one, using the values passed as children nodes.
 * 2. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [.sql] node, which is expected to contain the initial part of an SQL statement.
 * 3. The three child nodes with string values (`" from "`, `"CustomerCustomerDemo"`, and `" where keyword_count > 0"`) are appended in sequence after the value retrieved by [get-value].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically building an SQL query string by appending table and condition clauses to an existing base SQL command.
 * - Adding custom filtering logic to queries by concatenating different WHERE conditions based on application needs.
 * - Creating reusable query fragments by storing and extending SQL parts in different nodes.
