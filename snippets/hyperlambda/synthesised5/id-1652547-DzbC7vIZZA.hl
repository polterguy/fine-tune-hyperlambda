/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node(s) referenced by its expression.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@.dp/#/*/CustomerId` navigates to the [.dp] node, dereferences its value as a node (using `#`), selects all its children (`*`), and then filters for nodes named [CustomerId].
 * 3. The result is the value of the [CustomerId] node(s) found as children of the node referenced by the value of [.dp].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the customer ID from a data structure passed by reference in a loop or dynamic context.
 * - Accessing a specific property (like [CustomerId]) from a referenced node for further processing or validation.
 * - Fetching values from nested nodes when working with collections or complex data objects.
