/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot is used to delete nodes from the graph based on the result of its expression.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@data.select/*/*/keyword_count` locates all [keyword_count] nodes that are descendants of any node under any node beneath [data.select].
 * 3. When executed, every [keyword_count] node found at this location will be permanently removed from the structure, including their values and any children they may have.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cleaning up unwanted [keyword_count] nodes after processing query results in [data.select].
 * - Removing sensitive or redundant keyword count information before returning data to a client.
 * - Preparing a dataset for export or further manipulation by stripping out [keyword_count] fields.
