/*
 * 1. The [slots.create] slot defines a dynamic slot named [get.pi], which when invoked returns a decimal value of 3.14159 using the [return-value] slot.
 * 2. The [signal] slot is used to invoke the previously created [get.pi] slot, resulting in the value of the [signal] node being set to 3.14159.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Register a reusable slot for returning the mathematical constant π to support calculations in other workflows.
 * - Provide a standardized way for other processes or modules to retrieve the value of π within your Hyperlambda application.
 * - Simplify mathematical logic by centralizing the value of π, making updates or precision changes easy to maintain.
