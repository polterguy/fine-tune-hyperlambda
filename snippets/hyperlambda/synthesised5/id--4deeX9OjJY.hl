/*
 * 1. The [mime.create] slot constructs a MIME message of type "multipart/mixed" with two child [entity] nodes.
 *    - The first [entity] has a content type of "text/plain" and attaches the file located at [/README.md] by specifying the [filename] node, which streams the file's content into the MIME message as an attachment.
 *    - The second [entity] is also "text/plain" but contains a simple text payload "Bar" via the [content] node.
 * 2. The [mime.parse] slot then parses the MIME message created by the previous node (referenced using `:x:-` to access its immediate older sibling), transforming the raw MIME structure back into a node-based representation, extracting headers, content, and attachment meta-data.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Programmatically create an email or HTTP message with both a file attachment and plain text, parse it, and inspect or manipulate its structure.
 * - Automate testing of MIME message parsing and serialization by round-tripping between creation and parsing in Hyperlambda.
 * - Use in file upload/download workflows to package files and metadata together in a standard format and later retrieve or process them.
 * - Extract and inspect attachments or content from complex MIME messages received from external systems.
