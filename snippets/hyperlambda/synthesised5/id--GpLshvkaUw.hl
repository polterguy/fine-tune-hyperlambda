/*
 * 1. The [if] slot checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to the "admin" role by calling [auth.ticket.in-role:admin]. If true, it executes its [.lambda] child.
 * 2. Inside the [.lambda] node, [set-value] updates the [.result] node with the value "Welcome, admin!".
 * 3. The [else] slot executes if the previous [if] condition is false, setting the [.result] node to "Access denied".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Displaying different dashboard content to administrators versus regular users.
 * - Restricting access to sensitive actions or data unless the user is an admin.
 * - Providing clear feedback to unauthorized users attempting to access admin-only resources.
 * - Enforcing role-based access control at the endpoint or UI level.
