/*
 * 1. The [and] slot combines multiple conditions, ensuring all its child conditions must evaluate to true for the overall result to be true.
 * 2. Each [not] slot inverts the result of its child condition, meaning it will return true if the [strings.starts-with] slot returns false.
 * 3. The [strings.starts-with] slot checks if the value at the path `:x:@csv2lambda/0/0` begins with the specified string (either "http://" or "https://").
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To validate that the value at [csv2lambda]/0/0 does not start with either "http://" or "https://".
 * - To ensure that a link or string does not use an HTTP or HTTPS scheme, perhaps enforcing local or non-web resource references.
 * - Useful for filtering out web URLs from a set of imported CSV values, only allowing non-web data for further processing.
 * - Preventing accidental inclusion of web addresses in imported data fields.
