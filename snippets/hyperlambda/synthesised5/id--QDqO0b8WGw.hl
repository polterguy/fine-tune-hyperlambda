/*
 * 1. The [.data] node is created with three child nodes: [foo1], [foo2], and [foo3], each having their own string values.
 * 2. The [get-name] slot is invoked with the expression `:x:@.data/1`, which references the second child node of [.data] (since child indices are zero-based in Hyperlambda).
 * 3. [get-name] returns the name of the referenced node, which in this case would be "foo2".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the name of a specific child node for logging or display purposes.
 * - Dynamically identifying which field was selected from a data set.
 * - Verifying the structure of a node tree by programmatically retrieving node names at given positions.
 * - Debugging: Checking the exact node names at certain indices within a collection.
