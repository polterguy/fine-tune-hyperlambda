/*
 * 1. The [config.get] slot retrieves a configuration value from the application's configuration settings.
 * 2. The value "mail.smtp.username" specifies the path to the configuration key being accessed, which in this case is the username used for SMTP mail sending.
 * 3. After execution, the [config.get] node will contain the value of the "mail.smtp.username" configuration setting as a string.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Fetching the SMTP username to authenticate when sending emails.
 * - Dynamically reading email credentials for use in other slots, such as [mail.smtp.send].
 * - Providing configuration-driven values to avoid hardcoding sensitive information in Hyperlambda scripts.
