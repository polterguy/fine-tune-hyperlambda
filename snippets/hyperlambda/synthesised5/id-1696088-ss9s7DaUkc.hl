/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node(s) referenced by the expression `:x:@.fields`.  
 * 2. The `@.fields` expression returns the first node named [.fields] in the current scope, so [get-value] will resolve and return its value.
 * 3. If [.fields] contains a value, that value will be returned; otherwise, the result will be null.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the value from a [.fields] node received as part of a request payload.
 * - Fetching dynamic field content from a data structure for further processing or output.
 * - Accessing user-defined parameters stored in [.fields] for use in subsequent logic.
