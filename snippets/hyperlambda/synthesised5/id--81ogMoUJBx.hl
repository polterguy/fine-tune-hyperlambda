/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node at the top indicates that this code is meant to be an HTTP endpoint, expecting input parameters.
 * 2. The [data.connect] node is used to establish a database connection to the database named "DBCustomers". The [database-type] child node specifies that the connection should use the SQLite database adapter.
 * 3. Within the [data.connect] node, a [data.read] operation is performed. This reads data from the [employees] table, again specifying the SQLite adapter with another [database-type] node.
 * 4. The [yield] node at the end collects all records returned by the [data.read] operation, using the expression `:x:@data.read/*` to gather all resulting child nodes, and returns them under a [records] node as the endpoint's response.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Creating an HTTP endpoint that fetches all employees from the "DBCustomers" SQLite database and returns the results.
 * - Serving employee data to a frontend application by exposing a simple API endpoint.
 * - Integrating with other systems that need to retrieve employee records from a SQLite-backed system.
 * - Rapid prototyping of data retrieval endpoints for internal tools or admin dashboards.
