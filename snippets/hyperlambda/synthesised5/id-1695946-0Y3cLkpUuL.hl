/*
 * 1. The [remove-nodes] slot deletes all nodes referenced by its expression. In this case, `:x:@.fields/*` targets all child nodes of the [.fields] node and removes them from the node graph.
 * 2. The expression `@.fields/*` selects every immediate child of the [.fields] node, regardless of their names or values.
 * 3. This operation is destructive, permanently eliminating the selected nodes from the structure at execution time.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Clearing all field definitions in a data schema by removing every child node under [.fields].
 * - Resetting a form or configuration by deleting all current entries within the [.fields] container.
 * - Preparing for a fresh insert of new field nodes by first removing existing ones to avoid duplication.
