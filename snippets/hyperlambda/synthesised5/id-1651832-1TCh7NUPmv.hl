/*
 * 1. The [validators.integer] slot validates that the value of each node matched by the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/max` is an integer within the specified range.
 * 2. The [min] child node sets the minimum allowed value to 1.
 * 3. The [max] child node sets the maximum allowed value to 5000.
 * 4. If any node referenced by the expression has a value outside the range 1 to 5000 (inclusive), an exception will be thrown.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring that a user-supplied "max" argument in an API endpoint is within a safe operational range.
 * - Validating configuration values for pagination or limits to prevent excessively large or small numbers.
 * - Enforcing business rules where a numeric parameter must be constrained between defined boundaries.
