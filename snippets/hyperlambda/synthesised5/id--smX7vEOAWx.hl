/*
 * 1. The [convert] slot is used to transform the value of the [.src] node from its original type, which is a string (since no type is specified), into a decimal type.
 * 2. The [type] child node under [convert] explicitly specifies the target type for the conversion, in this case "decimal".
 * 3. The expression `:x:@.src` points to the value of the [.src] node, ensuring that the conversion operates on its value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Ensuring numeric data retrieved from user input is converted to a decimal before performing mathematical operations or storing it in a strongly typed database column.
 * - Preparing values for math functions that require specific types, such as calculating financial data where decimal precision is important.
 * - Validating and converting data from strings to decimals in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes before further manipulation.
