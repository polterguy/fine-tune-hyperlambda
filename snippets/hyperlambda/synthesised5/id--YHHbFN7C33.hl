/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates over all child nodes of [.data], executing its child lambda for each node found in the result of `:x:@.data/*`.
 * 2. Inside the loop, [log.info] is used to log the value of the current node, which is referenced by [.dp/#]. This means for each child node of [.data], its value is sent to the log.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Outputting the values of a list of items stored under [.data] for debugging or auditing purposes.
 * - Looping through configuration nodes and logging their values for verification.
 * - Monitoring or tracing the processing of data elements one by one in a batch process.
 * - Quickly inspecting all items in a data collection without modifying them.
