/*
 * 1. The [auth.ticket.in-role] slot checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to any of the roles specified in its value, in this case "foo" or "root". It returns true if the user is a member of at least one of those roles, and false otherwise.
 * 2. The [auth.ticket.get] slot retrieves information about the authenticated user, including the username (returned as the slot's value), a [roles] list node containing the user's roles, and any additional claims present in the JWT token.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Conditionally displaying or hiding content in an HTTP endpoint depending on the user's role membership.
 * - Logging or auditing which user accessed a particular resource and what roles they have.
 * - Implementing fine-grained authorization logic where you first verify user roles and then fetch user details for further processing.
 * - Debugging or inspecting the active user's JWT claims during endpoint development or troubleshooting.
 * - Combining role checks with user data retrieval when customizing responses based on the user's role and identity.
