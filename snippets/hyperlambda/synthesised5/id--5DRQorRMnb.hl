/*
 * 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes a connection to the database named "sakila".
 * 2. The [data.transaction.create] slot begins a new database transaction within the context of the open connection.
 * 3. The [data.execute] slot runs a SQL command to delete all records from the [film_actor] table, but does not return any result set.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Performing a bulk delete operation within a transaction, so that changes can be committed or rolled back as needed.
 * - Ensuring data consistency by grouping multiple database operations in a transaction, for example when cleaning up related records.
 * - Testing the effect of a destructive SQL command in a transaction-safe way, since the transaction can be rolled back automatically if not explicitly committed.
 * - Automating administrative tasks on the [sakila] database, like purging data from [film_actor] while retaining control over the transaction boundaries.
