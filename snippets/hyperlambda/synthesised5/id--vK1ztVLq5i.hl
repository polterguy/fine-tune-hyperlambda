/*
 * 1. The [.arguments] node specifies the expected input arguments for the endpoint, in this case a [filter] argument of type string.
 * 2. The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks that the current user has a valid root authentication ticket, enforcing security by requiring root-level access.
 * 3. The [tasks.count] slot counts the number of tasks that match the value provided in the [filter] argument, using the expression `:x:@.arguments/*/filter`.
 * 4. The [unwrap] slot evaluates the next sibling node, which is typically used to execute any expressions or slots that follow it.
 * 5. The [return-nodes] slot returns a result node named [count] whose value is set to the output of the [tasks.count] slot.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Restricting access to a task count endpoint so only users with root privileges can see the count.
 * - Counting tasks based on a dynamic filter provided by the client, such as a specific status or label.
 * - Enabling administrators to quickly query the number of tasks matching given search criteria for reporting or auditing purposes.
 * - Integrating with dashboards that need to display the current number of tasks filtered by a user-supplied search parameter.
