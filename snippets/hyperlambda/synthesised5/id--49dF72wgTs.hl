/*
 * 1. The [cache.set] slot stores a new item in the cache using the key [.cache-item-key], setting its expiration to 5 seconds and assigning the value "Howdy world".
 * 2. The [cache.list] slot retrieves and returns a list of all current items in the cache, which will include the newly stored item if it has not expired.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Quickly testing if a cache entry has been successfully added by listing all items after insertion.
 * - Monitoring the current contents of the cache for debugging or administrative purposes.
 * - Implementing cache management interfaces that show active cache keys and their associated data.
 * - Auditing cache usage to ensure certain keys are being set and retained as expected.
