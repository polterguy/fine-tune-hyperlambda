/*
 * 1. [data.connect] establishes a connection to the "northwind" database using the "generic" connection string and specifies the database type as SQLite.
 * 2. [add] with expression `:x:./*/data.delete/*/where/*/and` injects all nodes from [.arguments] as conditions into the [and] node of the [where] clause for the [data.delete] operation.
 * 3. [data.delete] is configured to delete records from the [Employees] table in the SQLite database, using the dynamically injected [where]/[and] conditions.
 * 4. [add] with expression `:x:./*/sockets.signal/*/args` adds all nodes from [.arguments] as arguments to the [args] node of [sockets.signal].
 * 5. [add] with expression `:x:./*/sockets.signal` adds the result of [auth.ticket.verify] as a child node to [sockets.signal].
 * 6. [set-name] renames the [auth.ticket.verify] node under [sockets.signal] to [roles].
 * 7. [sockets.signal] emits a signal named "northwind.Employees.delete" with the prepared [args] and [roles] nodes.
 * 8. [unwrap] evaluates all immediate children of the current node, ensuring any expressions are resolved.
 * 9. [return] returns a node named [affected] containing the number of records deleted, as reported by [data.delete].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Deleting one or more employees from the [Employees] table in the Northwind database based on dynamic conditions provided as arguments.
 * - Broadcasting a real-time signal to clients or systems after employee records are deleted, including authorization information.
 * - Integrating secure, transactional employee deletion with event-driven notification in a multi-user application.
