/*
 * 1. The [for-each] slot iterates through each child node of [.words], passing each node by reference into a [.dp] node for the inner block to operate on.
 * 2. The [set-value] slot assigns a new value to the currently iterated node, which is referenced by [.dp/#].
 * 3. The [strings.to-lower] slot transforms the value of the current node to all lowercase letters before itâ€™s set back on the node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Automatically convert every word in a list under [.words] to lowercase for case-insensitive processing.
 * - Normalize user input by ensuring all stored words are lowercase.
 * - Prepare a list of words for comparison or searching by eliminating case differences.
