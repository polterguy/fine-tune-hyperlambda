/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.sql] node with the result of its child slot.
 * 2. [strings.concat] is used to concatenate multiple strings and expressions together; here, it builds an SQL fragment.
 * 3. [get-value] retrieves the current value of the [.sql] node, allowing incremental construction of the SQL statement.
 * 4. The static string nodes (.: " from ", .:leads, .:" where keyword_count > 0") are appended in order to form a valid SQL "FROM" and "WHERE" clause.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Dynamically constructing an SQL query string within a Hyperlambda workflow.
 * - Modifying an existing SQL fragment by appending table and filter criteria.
 * - Building complex SQL queries step by step for later execution or debugging.
 * - Reusing or extending an existing SQL statement for different data retrieval scenarios.
