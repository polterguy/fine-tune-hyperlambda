/*
 * 1. The [strings.regex-replace] slot is used to perform a regular expression-based replacement on the value of the [.phrase] node. 
 * 2. The first argument (`"\\bapple\\b"`) defines the regex pattern, matching the exact word "apple" (using word boundaries to avoid matching "apple" inside other words).
 * 3. The second argument (".:fruit") specifies the replacement string, so any occurrence of the word "apple" will be replaced with "fruit" in the original string.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - To replace stand-alone words in a sentence without affecting similar words or substrings.
 * - To sanitize or standardize specific keywords in user input or text data.
 * - To perform advanced search-and-replace operations using regex patterns in strings stored in nodes like [.phrase].
