 * 1. The [cache.set] slot is used to store a cache entry with the key [cache-item-key], a value of "Howdy world", and an expiration time of 5 seconds. 
 * 2. The [cache.count] slot then returns the total number of cache items currently stored.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Cache a response or computed value temporarily and then inspect how many items are in the cache.
 * - Monitor cache growth by counting items after adding entries.
 * - Ensure that cache insertion works as expected by verifying the count increases.
