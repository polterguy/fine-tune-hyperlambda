/*
 * 1. The [if] slot evaluates a condition using the [or] slot. The [or] slot combines two [eq] (equality) expressions, where each [eq] checks if the result of its respective expression matches a given value.
 * 2. If either [eq] condition evaluates to true, the [if] executes its [.lambda] child nodes, meaning the logic inside [.lambda] will run.
 * 3. The [else] slot acts as a fallback and will only execute its child nodes if none of the conditions in [if] are trueâ€”i.e., if both [eq] comparisons fail.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Checking if a user input matches any of two accepted values and running specific logic only if either is matched.
 * - Running a default action when neither of two alternate conditions is met.
 * - Implementing multi-branch conditional logic for configuration or decision flows.
