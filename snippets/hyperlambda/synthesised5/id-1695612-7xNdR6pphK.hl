/*
 * 1. The [eq] slot is used here to compare two values for strict equality.
 * 2. The first argument retrieves the value of the [cache.get] node using the expression `:x:@cache.get`.
 * 3. The second argument is an unnamed node with no value, which in Hyperlambda represents a null or empty value.
 * 4. The [eq] slot will evaluate to true if the value fetched from [cache.get] is exactly equal to null (i.e., if the cache did not contain a value for the specified key).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Checking if a cache lookup missed and returned null, allowing for conditional logic based on cache presence.
 * - Validating whether a cache entry exists before taking some fallback action (e.g., loading data from a database).
 * - Ensuring that code only proceeds if a required value is present in the cache.
