 * 1. The [strings.trim] slot removes all leading and trailing whitespace (or specified characters) from the string value provided as its argument.
 * 2. When executed with the string ["   hello   "], it will return the string with spaces at the beginning and end stripped, resulting in ["hello"].
 * 3. This slot is useful for cleaning up user input or normalizing data by ensuring there are no extraneous spaces or unwanted characters at the start or end of a string.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Removing whitespace from form input before saving to a database.
 * - Normalizing strings when comparing user-submitted values.
 * - Cleaning up CSV or text file entries during data import.
