/*
 * 1. The [.src] node contains a child node named [foo] without a value.
 * 2. The [not-null] slot checks if the expression `:x:@.src/*/foo` yields any nodes that have a value.
 * 3. Since [foo] exists but has no value, [not-null] will return false.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - To verify if a specific child node of a given parent exists and has a value assigned.
 * - As part of validation logic before proceeding with business rules that require non-null data.
 * - To help determine if data has been properly initialized or needs to be set.
