/*
 * 1. The [crypto.password.hash] slot is used to generate a secure password hash from the value provided as its argument. In this case, the value is provided by the expression `:x:-`, which typically refers to the previous node's value in the execution tree.
 * 2. The generated hash uses the Blowfish algorithm, which is designed to be slow and incorporates a per-record salt, making it resistant to brute-force and rainbow table attacks.
 * 3. This hashed value can be stored securely (e.g., in a database) instead of the original password, and later verified using [crypto.password.verify].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Storing user passwords securely in a database by hashing them before persistence.
 * - Generating a hashed password to compare against user input during authentication.
 * - Creating secure password hashes for integration with authentication systems or APIs that require hashed credentials.
