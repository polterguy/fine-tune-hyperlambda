/*
 * 1. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.title2] node by assigning it a new value.
 * 2. The [strings.replace] slot is used to perform a string replacement operation on the current value of the [.title2] node, where all double quote characters (") are replaced with single quote characters (').
 * 3. The first argument to [strings.replace] specifies the string to find (in this case, a double quote), and the second argument indicates what it should be replaced with (a single quote).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Sanitizing string values by converting double quotes to single quotes, for example when processing user-supplied titles.
 * - Preparing text for insertion into a database or output format that requires single quotes instead of double quotes.
 * - Standardizing quote characters in text fields for consistency in a document or application.
