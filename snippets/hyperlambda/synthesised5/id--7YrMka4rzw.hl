/*
 * 1. The [slots.create] slot is used to dynamically define a new slot named [test] that, when invoked, returns a single value "OK" via the [return-value] slot.
 * 2. The [try-signal] slot attempts to invoke the [test] slot that was just created. Unlike [signal], [try-signal] will not throw an error if [test] does not exist, making it safer for optional or conditional slot invocations.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Running a custom logic block only if it was registered previously, without risking an exception if it doesn't exist.
 * - Creating lightweight, extensible plugin points in your application where business logic can be injected dynamically.
 * - Safely testing for the existence and invocation of optional dynamic slots during modular system startup or shutdown.
