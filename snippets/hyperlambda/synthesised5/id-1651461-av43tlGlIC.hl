/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. The expression `:x:@http.get/*/content/*/origin` navigates to the [http.get] node, then to its [content] child, then to any child of [content] named [origin].
 * 3. The result is the value of the [origin] node found within the [content] section of the [http.get] response.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the client's IP address from an HTTP GET response that returns an [origin] field.
 * - Retrieving specific data from a nested HTTP response structure for further processing.
 * - Using the extracted value as input for subsequent logic or to display in a user interface.
