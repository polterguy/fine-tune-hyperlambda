/*
 * 1. The [add] slot is adding child nodes.
 * 2. The expression `:x:../*/return-nodes/*/databases` targets all [databases] nodes found as children of any [return-nodes] node that is a sibling of the parent node.
 * 3. [get-nodes] with the expression `:x:@hyper2lambda/*` retrieves all child nodes of the [hyper2lambda] node and adds them as children to each targeted [databases] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Appending new database definitions (parsed from Hyperlambda) into all [databases] sections within a dynamic slot's return context.
 * - Merging additional data generated from a transformation (such as parsing Hyperlambda code) into the result set before returning it from a dynamic slot.
 * - Dynamically updating the structure of returned data by injecting nodes generated in a previous processing step.
