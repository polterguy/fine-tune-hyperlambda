/*
 * 1. The [throw] slot is used to immediately raise an exception, halting further execution of the current Hyperlambda code.
 * 2. The value of the [throw] node provides the exception message: "You cannot create a database with the name of magic since it is a restricted name".
 * 3. This ensures that any attempt to create a database named "magic" will be explicitly blocked, and a clear error message will be returned to the caller.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Preventing users from creating a database with a reserved or restricted name.
 * - Enforcing naming conventions or restrictions in database management workflows.
 * - Providing immediate feedback to API clients or UI users when they attempt an unsupported operation.
