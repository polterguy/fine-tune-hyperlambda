/*
 * 1. The [math.divide] slot takes multiple numerical arguments and sequentially divides them. In this example, [math.divide] is initialized with a value of 100, and then a child node with a value of 4 is provided. The slot will divide 100 by 4, resulting in 25.
 * 2. Each argument can be provided as a static value (as shown with `:int:4`), or as the result of another slot invocation, making the slot flexible for both static and dynamic values.
 * 3. The resulting value after execution will replace the value of the [math.divide] node with the quotient (25 in this case).
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Calculating unit prices by dividing a total cost by the number of items.
 * - Converting values, such as dividing a distance by time to get speed.
 * - Dynamically processing user inputs where values to divide come from other nodes or computations.
