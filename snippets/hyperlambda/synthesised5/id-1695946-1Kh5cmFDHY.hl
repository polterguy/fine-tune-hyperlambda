/*
 * 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression `:x:@.sql`. This means it searches for the first node named [.sql] in the current context and returns its value.
 * 2. The expression `@.sql` ensures that only the first matching [.sql] node is targeted, not any of its children or siblings.
 * 3. The returned value can be used in subsequent operations, such as logging, assigning to another node, or passing as an argument to another slot.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Extracting the SQL statement generated or stored in a [.sql] node for further processing or debugging.
 * - Using the value of [.sql] as input to another slot that requires a SQL string.
 * - Logging or displaying the SQL query for auditing or review purposes.
 * - Dynamically deciding further workflow steps based on the actual SQL string stored in [.sql].
