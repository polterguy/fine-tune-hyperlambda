/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda. This is crucial for accessing input parameters in a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or slot, allowing for iteration or further filtering.
 * 
 * 3. `order` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "order". It is used to specifically target the "order" argument from the list of all arguments, assuming such an argument exists.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or endpoint to access and manipulate the "order" argument passed to it. For example, it could be used to retrieve an order ID or details from a set of input parameters to process an order in an e-commerce application.
