 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate up one level in the node hierarchy.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access every direct child node.
 * 3. `add` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "add". It is used to specifically target nodes named "add" among the children.
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "add" nodes. It is used to access every direct child node of the "add" nodes.
 * 5. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected nodes. It is used to access every direct child node of the nodes selected in the previous step.
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected nodes. It is used to access every direct child node of the nodes selected in the previous step.
 * 7. `completion` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "completion". It is used to specifically target nodes named "completion" among the children.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to find all "completion" nodes that are deeply nested within a hierarchy starting from a parent node, passing through several levels of "add" nodes and their children. This might be useful in a system where "completion" nodes represent the final result or output of a series of operations or calculations.
