/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards, searching through siblings and ancestors until it finds a node named "session". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing session-related data or configuration in a web application where session management is implemented.
 * - Retrieving user-specific session information for processing or validation purposes in a Hyperlambda script.
