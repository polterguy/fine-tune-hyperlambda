/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to replace occurrences of a string within a node's value using the [strings.replace] slot and then set the modified value back to the node. The [set-value] slot targets the node referenced by [.dp], and [strings.replace] replaces occurrences of a string specified by [get-value] from [.arguments/*/folder] with an empty string. The result is stored back into the original node. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the node referenced by [.dp] to the result of the [strings.replace] operation.
 * 2. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a specified string within the node's value.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the string to be replaced from [.arguments/*/folder].
 * 4. [.] - Represents an empty string used as the replacement value.
