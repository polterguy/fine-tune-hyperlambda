 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet evaluates whether the node's value, referenced by the expression [@.dp/#/*/\@href/[0,1]], is not equal to the value of the unnamed node. The [neq] slot is used to perform this "not equal" comparison. The expression [@.dp/#/*/\@href/[0,1]] navigates through the node structure to find the specific node to compare against the unnamed node's value. If the values are not equal, the [neq] slot will return true.
