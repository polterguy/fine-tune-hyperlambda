/*
 * 1. `@.issuer` - This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "issuer" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways (through siblings) in the node structure to locate the specified node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve configuration or metadata information about the issuer of a document or token in a larger data structure.
 * - It could be used in scenarios where you need to verify or log the issuer details before performing further operations in a Hyperlambda script.
