/*
 * The code snippet uses the [eval] slot to execute all child nodes of the [.onafter] node within the [.arguments] node. This allows for dynamic execution of code segments specified under the [.onafter] node, enabling flexible and modular code execution. 
 * 
 * 1. [eval] - Executes the children nodes of the node referenced in its expression.
 * 2. [x:@.arguments/*/.onafter] - Lambda expression pointing to the [.onafter] node within the [.arguments] node, whose children will be executed by [eval].
