// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [strings.replace] slot to remove occurrences of the substring " unsigned" from the result of a [strings.regex-replace] operation. The [strings.regex-replace] operation is expected to have been executed previously, and its result is being referenced here. The first argument to [strings.replace] is the string to look for (" unsigned"), and the second argument is an empty string, indicating that the matched substring should be replaced with nothing, effectively removing it.
