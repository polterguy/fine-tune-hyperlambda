/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [not] and [eq] slots to check if the value of the [connection-string] node within the [.arguments] node is not equal to an empty string. If the [connection-string] node has a value, the [eq] slot will evaluate to false, and the [not] slot will then negate this result to true, indicating that the [connection-string] is not empty. 
 * 
 * 1. [not] - Negates the boolean result of its child condition.
 * 2. [eq] - Compares two values for equality.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/connection-string] - Retrieves the value of the [connection-string] node within the [.arguments] node.
 * 4. [.:] - Represents an empty string for comparison.
