/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "sql" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It is used to access a specific node that is assumed to contain SQL-related data or instructions. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a context where you need to access and possibly execute or manipulate SQL commands or queries stored in a node named "sql".
 * - It could be part of a larger Hyperlambda script that interacts with a database, where the SQL node contains the query to be executed.
