/*
 * 1. `.`: This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the hierarchy of the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the node it is applied to.
 * 
 * 3. `signal`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those with the name "signal". It is used to narrow down the node set to only those nodes that are named "signal".
 * 
 * 4. `=magic.ai.crawl-site`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those with the value "magic.ai.crawl-site". It is used to further narrow down the node set to only those nodes that have this specific value.
 * 
 * 5. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the node it is applied to.
 * 
 * 6. `.onafter`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those with the name ".onafter". It is used to narrow down the node set to only those nodes that are named ".onafter".
 * 
 * 7. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the node it is applied to.
 * 
 * 8. `.instruction`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those with the name ".instruction". It is used to narrow down the node set to only those nodes that are named ".instruction".
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include navigating a Hyperlambda structure to find specific instructions related to a "magic.ai.crawl-site" signal, possibly for processing or executing instructions after a certain event has occurred. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically respond to events in a web crawling or AI processing context.
