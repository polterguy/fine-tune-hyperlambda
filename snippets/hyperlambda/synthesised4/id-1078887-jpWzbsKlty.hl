/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of its previous result set. It moves to the next node in the Hyperlambda structure, which is useful when you want to process or evaluate nodes sequentially and need to access the next node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all the children of the current node, allowing you to perform operations or evaluations on multiple nodes at the same level.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - The second `*` iterator again retrieves all children nodes, but this time of the nodes retrieved by the first `*`. This allows you to delve deeper into the hierarchy, accessing the grandchildren of the original node.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - The third `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes retrieved by the second `*`, effectively accessing the great-grandchildren of the original node. This is useful for operations that need to traverse multiple levels of a node hierarchy.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used in scenarios where you need to process or evaluate a deeply nested structure, such as a complex configuration or data file, and perform operations on nodes that are several levels deep relative to a starting point.
 * - It can be useful in data transformation tasks where you need to apply changes or extract information from a specific depth in a hierarchical data structure.
