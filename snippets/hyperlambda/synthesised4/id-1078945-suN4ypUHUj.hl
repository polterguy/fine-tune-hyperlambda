/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. In the context of Hyperlambda, this means it will move to the next node below the current one in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the node that comes immediately after the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. After moving to the elder sibling with the `+` iterator, this part will access all direct children of that sibling node. This is useful for operations that need to be applied to all children of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `/*` - This iterator, applied again, retrieves all children nodes of each node found in the previous step. This effectively goes two levels deep from the elder sibling, accessing all grandchildren nodes. This is useful for operations that need to be applied to all nodes two levels down from a specific starting point.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to gather or manipulate data from a specific structure where you need to access nodes two levels down from the next sibling of a current node. For example, if you have a list of sibling nodes each representing a category, and each category has subcategories and items, this expression could help in accessing all items under the subcategories of the next category in the list.
