/*
 * 1. `@.invoke` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named "invoke" in the current context. It searches for this node within the current node's siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you want to locate a specific node named "invoke" that might be part of a larger structure or sequence of operations.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "invoke" node. It is useful for accessing all the elements or operations that are part of the "invoke" node, allowing you to perform actions or checks on each child node.
 * 
 * 3. `.finish_reason` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "finish_reason" among the children of the "invoke" node. It is useful for extracting specific information related to the completion or termination of a process, such as understanding why a particular invocation finished or ended.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to log or analyze the reasons for the completion of various invoked processes. For example, in a workflow automation system, you might want to track why certain tasks were completed to optimize or debug the workflow.
 * - Another use case could be in an API response handling mechanism, where you need to extract and handle the reason for the completion of an API call to determine subsequent actions or error handling procedures.
