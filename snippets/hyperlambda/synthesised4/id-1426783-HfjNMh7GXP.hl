// The Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and retrieve the value of the node located at the path specified by the expression "x:+/*/*/*/content". This expression navigates through the node hierarchy, starting from the current node, moving to the next sibling, and then traversing through multiple levels of children nodes until it reaches a node named "content". The [unwrap] slot ensures that the value of this "content" node is evaluated and returned before the execution continues.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*/content
