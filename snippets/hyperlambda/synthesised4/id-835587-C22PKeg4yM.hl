// The code uses the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the value of the [aggregate_function] node within the [.arguments] node is one of the predefined legal values: "min", "max", "sum", or "avg". If the value does not match any of these options, an exception will be thrown. This validation ensures that only allowed aggregate functions are used in the context where this validator is applied.
