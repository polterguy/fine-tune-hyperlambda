/*
 * 1. `@.tail`: This iterator searches for the first node named "tail" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node that might not be a direct child or sibling but exists somewhere in the current scope.
 * 
 * 2. `+`: This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the node found by the previous iterator. It moves downwards in the hierarchy to find the next node at the same level. This is particularly useful when you want to access a node that is positioned immediately after a known node, allowing you to perform operations or retrieve values from it.
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression could include scenarios where you need to process or manipulate data in a sequence, such as iterating over a list of nodes and performing actions on each subsequent node relative to a known reference point.
