// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to append a node to a specific location within a Hyperlambda graph. It navigates through a data connection and reading structure to the [where] clause, and within it, to an [and] condition, where it adds a new node with the name [embedding.eq]. This operation is useful for dynamically constructing or modifying query conditions in a data reading process.
