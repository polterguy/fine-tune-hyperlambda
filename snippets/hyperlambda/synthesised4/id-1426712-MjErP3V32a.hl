// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. It sets the value of the [.tmp-completion] node to the value of the [.result] node, but only if none of the preceding conditional slots (like [if] or [else-if]) evaluate to true. This ensures that [.tmp-completion] is only updated as a last resort, reflecting the outcome when no other conditions are met.

   set-value:x:@.tmp-completion
      get-value:x:@.result
