// The code snippet uses the [not] slot to evaluate the negation of an equality condition. It checks if the [content] node, which is a child of the node preceding the current node, does not have an empty value. The [eq] slot compares the value of the [content] node obtained using [get-value] with an empty string, and [not] negates this result.
