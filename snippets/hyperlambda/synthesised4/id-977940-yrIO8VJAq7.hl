// The code iterates over each child node of [.payload] using [for-each], retrieves the name of each node with [get-name], and evaluates the node's children using [unwrap]. It then adds a new node to [.summary] with the key being the name of the current node. The process effectively summarizes the payload by capturing the names of its elements.
