// 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before in its hierarchy that matches the given name, which in this case is "sql". It searches upwards in the hierarchy from the current node to find the first occurrence of a node named "sql". This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is an ancestor or sibling of the current node, allowing you to reference data or settings that are defined higher up in the structure.
