 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [Extra] node, which is a child of the node referenced by [.dp], is equal to the string "DEFAULT_GENERATED". If the values are equal, the [eq] slot will evaluate to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [eq] - Compares two values for equality.
 * 2. [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/Extra] - Retrieves the value of the [Extra] node, which is a child of the node referenced by [.dp].
 * 3. [.:DEFAULT_GENERATED] - Static string value to compare against.
