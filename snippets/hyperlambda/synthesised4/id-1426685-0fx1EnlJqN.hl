/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to retrieve the first non-null value from a set of potential values. It first attempts to get the value of the "theme" node within the ".arguments" node. If this value is null, it defaults to the static value "modern". This pattern is useful for setting default values when certain arguments might not be provided. 
 * 
 * 1. [get-first-value] - Retrieves the first non-null value from its children or expression.
 * 2. [get-value] - Attempts to get the value of the "theme" node within ".arguments".
 * 3. [.] - Provides a default value of "modern" if the first attempt returns null.
