/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and it will find the first occurrence of `.arguments` in the current node hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It allows access to each child node under `.arguments`, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `email` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `email`. It selects nodes from the children of `.arguments` that specifically have the name `email`.
 * 
 * This expression is useful for extracting an `email` node from a set of arguments, typically in a context where `.arguments` contains input parameters or data passed to a function or endpoint.
