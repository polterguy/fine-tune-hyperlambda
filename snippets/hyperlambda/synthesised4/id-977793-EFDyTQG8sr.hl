// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database and executes a SQL query to count the number of records in the "users" table where the "created_at" field matches the current date. The result is returned as a scalar value, which is typically used for aggregate results. The [data.scalar] slot is used to execute the SQL query and return a single value.
data.scalar:select count(*) from users where DATE(created_at) = CURRENT_DATE
