// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, [unwrap] is used to evaluate the expression at the current node level, ensuring that any expressions are resolved before further processing. This is useful for dynamically determining values or nodes in a Hyperlambda graph before they are explicitly invoked or used.
