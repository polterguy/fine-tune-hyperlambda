/*
 * This expression is a lambda expression with a single iterator. Below is an explanation of the iterator used in the expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@lambda2hyper`: This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "lambda2hyper" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that the search is for a node by name. It will return the first occurrence of a node named "lambda2hyper" within the current node's siblings and its descendants.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve a specific configuration or data node named "lambda2hyper" within a larger Hyperlambda graph. 
 * - It might be useful in scenarios where you need to access or modify the properties or values associated with a node named "lambda2hyper" in a dynamic or complex Hyperlambda structure.
