/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates a loop using the [while] slot, which continues iterating as long as the value of [times] is less than 3. Within each iteration, it adds a [message] node with the value "hello" to the [greetings] node, and increments the [times] node by 1. 
 * 
 * 1. [while] - Initiates a loop that continues as long as the condition is true.
 * 2. [lt] - Checks if the value of [times] is less than 3.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the current value of [times].
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code block to execute during each iteration.
 * 5. [add] - Adds a new [message] node to [greetings].
 * 6. [message] - The node added with the value "hello".
 * 7. [math.increment] - Increments the value of [times] by 1.
