/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before in its hierarchy that matches the given name. In this case, it looks for the first node named "result" in the hierarchy. This is useful for quickly accessing a specific node by name without traversing all nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use case: If you have a complex Hyperlambda structure and you need to quickly access a node named "result" to either read its value or modify it, this expression allows you to do so efficiently.
