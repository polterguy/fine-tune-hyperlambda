/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to modify the value of a node by replacing a specific substring within it. The code utilizes the [strings.replace] slot to perform the replacement operation. Here's a breakdown of the code:
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - This slot is used to change the value of the node specified by its expression, which in this case is [.result].
 * 2. [strings.replace] - This slot replaces occurrences of a specified string within another string. It is used here to replace a substring within the [.result] node's value.
 * 3. [extra] - This is a placeholder for the substring that needs to be replaced within the [.result] node's value.
 * 4. [get-value] - This slot retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression. In this case, it retrieves the value of the [extra] argument passed in as part of [.arguments].
 * 
 * The code effectively replaces the substring specified by [extra] within the [.result] node's value with the value of the [extra] argument.
