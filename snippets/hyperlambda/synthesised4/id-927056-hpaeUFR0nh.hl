// The code uses the [cache.try-get] slot to attempt retrieving an item from the cache using a specified key. If the item is not found, it executes the [.lambda] block, which returns "Howdy world", stores this value in the cache with the given key, and then returns the created item to the caller. This ensures that expensive operations to create cache items are executed only once, preventing race conditions.
