// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to assign a value to a node. It sets the value of the [.result] node to the value obtained from evaluating the expression within the [get-value] slot. The [set-value] slot takes an expression pointing to the destination node, and a source expression or static value as its child, to update the destination node's value.
