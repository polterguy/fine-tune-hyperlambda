// The code evaluates a logical condition using [and] and [or] slots. It checks if either the [not] condition of [exists] on [semantics] is true or the value of [semantics] is true, and if an [exists] condition on an [article] node within the [body] of an [html] structure is true. If both conditions are true, the [and] slot evaluates to true.
