// Retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate the node that is immediately below the current node in the Hyperlambda hierarchy. For example, if you are iterating through nodes and need to compare or combine data from adjacent nodes, this iterator can help you efficiently access the next sibling node.
