/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the name of a node matches a concatenated string consisting of a "/" and the value of a "path" node within the current iteration context. If the condition is true, it sets the value of the [.exists] node to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Starts a conditional check.
 * 2. [eq] - Compares two values for equality.
 * 3. [get-name] - Retrieves the name of the current node.
 * 4. [strings.concat] - Concatenates strings to form a single string.
 * 5. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the "path" node within the current iteration.
 * 6. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 7. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.exists] node to true if the condition is met.
