// This Hyperlambda code snippet appends a SQL query fragment to an existing SQL string. It uses the [set-value] slot to update the [.sql] node by concatenating its current value with additional strings using [strings.concat]. The concatenated strings include a static "from" clause, the table name "tasks", and a "where" condition filtering rows with a "keyword_count" greater than 0.
