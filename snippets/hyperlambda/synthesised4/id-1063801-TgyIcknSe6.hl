/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is useful when you need to access nodes from the top level of the structure, regardless of the current node's position in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it will retrieve all children of the root node.
 * 
 * 3. `return` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "return". It is used to locate specific nodes by name within the current context.
 * 
 * 4. `0` - This iterator retrieves the first child of its previous result set. It is used to select a specific node when multiple nodes are present, based on their order.
 * 
 * 5. `-` - This iterator retrieves the previous sibling (the node above) of its previous result set. It is used to navigate to nodes that are siblings of the current node.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it will retrieve all children of the node that is the previous sibling of the first "return" node.
 * 
 * 7. `snippets` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "snippets". It is used to locate specific nodes by name within the current context.
