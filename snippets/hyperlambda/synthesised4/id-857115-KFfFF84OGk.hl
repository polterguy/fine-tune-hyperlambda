// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between tables using the [join] slot. It specifies a left join on the Employees table, with an alias [as] for EmployeeID, and defines the join condition using the [on] slot, ensuring that EmployeeTerritories.EmployeeID matches EmployeeID.EmployeeID. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple join conditions.
join:Employees
   as:EmployeeID
   type:left

      and
         EmployeeTerritories.EmployeeID:EmployeeID.EmployeeID
