// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] logical operator in Hyperlambda, which evaluates to true only if all its child conditions are true. Here, it is used with a single condition [country.eq:France], which checks if the value of the [country] node is equal to "France". If this condition is true, the [and] operator will evaluate to true.
