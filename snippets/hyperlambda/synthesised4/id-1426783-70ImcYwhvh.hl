 * The provided Hyperlambda code is a logical condition using the [and] slot to evaluate two sub-conditions. It checks if the string value of the [result] node contains the substring "FUNCTION_INVOCATION[" and if the value of the [has-sent-waiting] node is not equal to true. If both conditions are met, the [and] slot evaluates to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.contains] - Checks if the [result] node contains the substring "FUNCTION_INVOCATION[".
 * 2. [neq] - Checks if the [has-sent-waiting] node is not equal to true.
