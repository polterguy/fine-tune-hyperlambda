// This Hyperlambda code checks if the [.status] node's value is "active" using the [eq] slot. If the condition is true, it executes the [.lambda] block, which sets the [.message] node's value to "System is running". The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, and [set-value] updates the node's value.
