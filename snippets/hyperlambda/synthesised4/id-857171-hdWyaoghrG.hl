// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate multiple strings into a single SQL query string. It retrieves the value of the [.sql] node, appends the string " from ", followed by the table name "activities", and finally adds the condition " where keyword_count > 0". This results in a complete SQL query string being constructed.
strings.concat:x:@.sql
   get-value:x:@.sql
   .:" from "
   .:activities
   .:" where keyword_count > 0"
