// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a node to the [.fibonacci_return] node, which is a child of the parent node of the current node's parent. The value added is retrieved from the [.next.int] node, indicating that it is likely part of a Fibonacci sequence calculation where the next integer in the sequence is being appended to a result list. The [add] slot is used to append nodes to a specified location in the node graph.
