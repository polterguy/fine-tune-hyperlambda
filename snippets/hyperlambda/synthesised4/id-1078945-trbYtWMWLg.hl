/*
 * 1. `@.prompt`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "prompt" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches through the current node's siblings and ancestors to find a node named "prompt". 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access or manipulate a node named "prompt" that is defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure, such as fetching a prompt message or configuration setting that is used in subsequent logic.
