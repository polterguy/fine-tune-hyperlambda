// The [data.create] slot is used to insert a new record into the specified database table. In this example, the [table] argument specifies the target table as "users_extra", while the [values] node is intended to contain the fields and their corresponding values for the new record. This slot ensures that any dynamic data is safely handled to prevent SQL injection attacks.
