// The [unwrap] slot is used to forward evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the expression "x:+/*/*" is evaluated, and the resulting nodes are unwrapped into the current node's context. This allows for dynamic manipulation of the node structure by evaluating and inserting nodes at the point of invocation. The [unwrap] slot is particularly useful when dealing with lambda objects that require pre-evaluation of expressions.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
