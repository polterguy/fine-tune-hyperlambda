/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the node named [max_context_tokens] within the [model] node to the result of a division operation. The division operation's result is retrieved using the [get-value] slot, pointing to a previously executed [math.divide] operation. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [max_context_tokens] node.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the result from a [math.divide] operation.
