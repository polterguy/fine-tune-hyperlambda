/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access all the arguments that have been passed to the slot or function.
 * 
 * 3. `stream` - This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes that have the name "stream". It is useful for specifically accessing the "stream" argument among potentially many other arguments.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases**:
 * - This expression can be used to access a specific argument named "stream" that has been passed to a function or slot, which might be used for streaming data operations or handling data streams in a Hyperlambda application.
 * - It can be used in a validation or processing step where only the "stream" argument is needed from a set of arguments.
