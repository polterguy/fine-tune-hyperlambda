// This Hyperlambda code uses an [if] statement to check if the value of the [value] node is equal to 1 using the [eq] slot. If the condition is true, it sets the value of the [result] node to "Value is 1" using the [set-value] slot. The [if] slot evaluates the condition and executes the [.lambda] block if the condition is met.
