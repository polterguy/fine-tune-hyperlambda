// This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database named "messaging_db" and reads from the "chat_logs" table. It selects the count of all records, aliasing it as "count", and limits the result to a single record. The [data.connect] slot establishes the connection, while [data.read] specifies the table and columns to retrieve. The [limit] slot restricts the number of records returned to one.
