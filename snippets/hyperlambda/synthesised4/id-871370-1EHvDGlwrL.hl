// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform SQL joins using the [data.read] slot with a SQLite database. It joins the "Orders" table with the "Employees" and "Shippers" tables using left joins, specifying join conditions with the [on] and [and] slots. The [columns] slot includes a distinct count function with an alias, and the [where] slot is prepared for additional conditions.
