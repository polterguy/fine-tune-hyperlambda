// This Hyperlambda code uses the [crypto.hash] slot to generate a hash of the data located at [.data]. The hash is returned in a "fingerprint" format, which is more human-readable and suitable for use as a key reference in databases or for network transmission. The [format] child node specifies the desired output format of the hash.
