// This Hyperlambda code checks multiple conditions using logical operators. It verifies that the [anchor] node is not null and not equal to an empty string, and ensures that the [url] node does not contain the "#" character. The [and] slot ensures all conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. The [not-null] and [neq] slots check the presence and non-emptiness of [anchor], while [not] and [strings.contains] ensure [url] lacks a specific character.
