 * The code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.url] node. It retrieves the value from a specified path using [get-value], which points to the first node in a collection within the [.dp] node's hierarchy. This operation effectively updates the [.url] node with a specific value extracted from a nested structure. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.url] node.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value from a specified path within the [.dp] node's hierarchy.
