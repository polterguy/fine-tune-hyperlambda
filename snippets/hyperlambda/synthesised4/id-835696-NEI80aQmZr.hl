// This Hyperlambda code uses the [auth.ticket.verify] slot to ensure that the currently authenticated user belongs to the "guest" role. If the user does not belong to this role, an exception will be thrown, effectively preventing unauthorized access to the resource or endpoint. This is typically used to secure endpoints by enforcing role-based access control.
