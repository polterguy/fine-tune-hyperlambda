// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.create] slot to insert a new record into the "customers" table. It specifies the table name as "customers" and uses the [values] node to define the fields to be inserted. The fields "name" and "org_no" are set using lambda expressions that reference arguments passed into the Hyperlambda, ensuring dynamic value assignment for these fields. This approach helps in preventing SQL injection by using parameterized values.
data.create
   table:customers
   values
      name.eq:x:@.arguments/*/name
      org_no.eq:x:@.arguments/*/org_no
