// The code uses the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes into a destination node. It targets the result of a [for-each] loop, specifically focusing on the nodes returned by [return-nodes]. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves nodes referenced by [.dp], which is the current node in the iteration, and these nodes are added to the destination node specified by the expression in [add].
