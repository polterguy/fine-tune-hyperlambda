// The code uses the [yield] slot to return the result of a PostgreSQL create operation, specifically the new product ID, from a dynamically executed SQL statement. The [pgsql.create] slot is responsible for inserting a new record into a PostgreSQL database, and the [yield] slot ensures the new product ID is returned as part of the lambda execution result.
