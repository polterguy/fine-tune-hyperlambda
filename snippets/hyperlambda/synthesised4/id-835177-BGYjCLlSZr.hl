// This code checks if there are any child nodes under the current node referenced by [.dp] and if such nodes exist, it sets a warning message. The warning indicates that complex objects are present, and manual editing of expressions might be necessary to reference these nodes. The [if] slot evaluates the condition using [exists], and if true, the [.lambda] block is executed to set the warning message using [set-value].

         .:Warning, some of your actions, and/or arguments, are returning complex objects, and we cannot automatically create candidate expressions for these. You will have to manually edit some of your expressions if you want to reference these nodes in your actions.
