// This Hyperlambda code snippet appends nodes from the [urls] node to the children of the [urls] node inside the [return] node. It uses [add] to dynamically add nodes, and [get-nodes] to retrieve nodes from the specified [urls] path. The [add] slot takes an expression leading to the destination node, while [get-nodes] retrieves nodes from the specified source path.
add:x:./*/return/*/urls
   get-nodes:x:@.urls/*
