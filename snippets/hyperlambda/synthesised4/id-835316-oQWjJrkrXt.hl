// This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the value of the node [function-result] to the value obtained from the node [lambda2json]. The [set-value] slot is used to assign a new value to a node, and [get-value] retrieves the current value of the specified node. The expression in [set-value] points to [function-result], while [get-value] points to [lambda2json], effectively copying the value from [lambda2json] to [function-result].
set-value:x:@.function-result
   get-value:x:@lambda2json
