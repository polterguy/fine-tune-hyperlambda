/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. It's used to access the arguments passed into a function or slot, typically at the root level of an HTTP endpoint or a dynamically executed slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of `.arguments`, allowing for iteration or further filtering.
 * 
 * 3. `/offset` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `offset`. It is used to specifically access the `offset` argument within the `.arguments` node, which might represent a pagination offset or a similar parameter in the context of the function or endpoint.
