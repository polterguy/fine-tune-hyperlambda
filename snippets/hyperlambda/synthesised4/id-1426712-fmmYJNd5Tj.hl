/*
 * The Hyperlambda code uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a signal to a specific session, with an argument [args] containing a key-value pair where the key is "function_error" and the value is "Too many function invocations". This is typically used to notify a client connected through a WebSocket about an error related to excessive function calls. 
 * 
 * 1. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to a specified session.
 * 2. [args] - Contains the arguments to be sent with the signal, in this case, an error message.
 * 3. [function_error] - The key in the [args] node, indicating the type of error being reported.
 * 4. [Too many function invocations] - The value associated with the [function_error] key, describing the specific error.
