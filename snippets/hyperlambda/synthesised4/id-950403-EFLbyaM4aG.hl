// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the node referenced by [@.value] is equal to 10 using the [eq] slot. If the condition is true, it executes the [.lambda] block, which logs the message "Value is 10" using the [log.info] slot. The [if] slot is used to perform this conditional check and execute the subsequent actions.
