/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert a node named "references" as a child of all nodes named "return" within the current node's parent. 
 * 
 * 1. [add:x:../*/return] - This slot is used to add new nodes. The expression "x:../*/return" specifies that the new node should be added as a child to all nodes named "return" that are siblings of the current node's parent.
 * 2. [.] - This node acts as a container for the node(s) to be added.
 * 3. [references] - This is the node being added as a child to the specified "return" nodes.
