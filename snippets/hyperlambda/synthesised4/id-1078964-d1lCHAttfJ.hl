/*
 * 1. `@xml2lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `xml2lambda` in the current context. It's used to locate the starting point for further navigation within the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the `xml2lambda` node. It's useful for accessing any direct child nodes without filtering by name.
 * 
 * 3. `sitemapindex` - This filters the previously retrieved children nodes to only include those named `sitemapindex`. It narrows down the selection to nodes of interest.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the `sitemapindex` node. This allows access to any direct descendants of the `sitemapindex`.
 * 
 * 5. `sitemap` - Filters the children nodes to only include those named `sitemap`. This step focuses on nodes that are specifically `sitemap` nodes.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the `sitemap` node. This step is necessary to access further nested nodes within each `sitemap`.
 * 
 * 7. `[0,25]` - This retrieves a subset of the children nodes, starting from the first node and including up to 25 nodes. This is useful for limiting the number of nodes processed, potentially for performance reasons or to adhere to specific requirements.
 * 
 * 8. `loc` - Filters the subset of nodes to only include those named `loc`. This step targets nodes that contain location information.
 * 
 * 9. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the `loc` node. This is used to access any further nested nodes within each `loc`.
 * 
 * 10. `#text` - This retrieves the value of the node, assuming the value is a node itself. It's used here to extract the text content of the `loc` node, which is likely a URL or location string.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to extract the first 25 URLs from a sitemap XML structure, which is useful for applications like web crawlers or SEO tools that need to process or display a subset of sitemap entries.
 * - It could also be used in a validation or monitoring tool to ensure that the first 25 entries in a sitemap are correctly formatted or accessible.
