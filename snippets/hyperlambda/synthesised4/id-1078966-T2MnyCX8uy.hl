/*
 * 1. `@.api-key`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "api-key" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a match. This is useful for accessing configuration or sensitive information like an API key that might be stored in a higher-level node for security or organizational purposes.
 * 
 * Potential use case: Retrieving an API key stored in a configuration node to authenticate API requests.
