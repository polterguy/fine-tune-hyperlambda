/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.url] node by concatenating the values retrieved from two different sources: the [.base] node and a specific node referenced by a complex expression. The [strings.concat] slot combines these values into a single string, which is then assigned to [.url] using [set-value]. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.url] node to the result of the [strings.concat] operation.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates the values retrieved from its child nodes.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.base] - Retrieves the value of the [.base] node.
 * 4. [get-value:x:"@.dp/#/*/\\@src/[0,1]"] - Retrieves the value of a node specified by a complex expression, which involves dereferencing and filtering nodes.
