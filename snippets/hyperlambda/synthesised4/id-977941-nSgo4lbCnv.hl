/*
 * The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes from one part of the node structure to another. It specifically adds all child nodes of the [settings] node from the [.original] node to the [settings] node under the [.clone] node. The [get-nodes] slot is used to retrieve the nodes to be added. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the destination node specified in its expression.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves the nodes specified in its expression to be added to the destination.
