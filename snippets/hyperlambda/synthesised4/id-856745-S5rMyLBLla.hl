/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to determine the Hyperlambda type of a node's value. It first declares a node [.foo] with an integer type and value of 57. The [type] slot is then used with an expression pointing to the previous node to retrieve its type, which will be "int" after execution. This showcases type introspection in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer type and value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the Hyperlambda type of the previous node's value.
