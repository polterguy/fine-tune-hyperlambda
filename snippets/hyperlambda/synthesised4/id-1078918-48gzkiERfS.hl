/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot, especially in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints.
 *    
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of `.arguments`.
 * 
 * 3. `render_button` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `render_button` among the children of `.arguments`. It is used to specifically target an argument or parameter named `render_button`.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a dynamic slot or HTTP endpoint to retrieve the value of an argument named `render_button` that is passed to it. This is useful when you need to perform operations based on the presence or value of a `render_button` argument, such as rendering a button on a web page or UI component.
