// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [not] slot to negate the result of an [eq] (equality) comparison. It checks if the value obtained from the [get-value] slot, which points to a node named [whitelist], is not equal to a null value. If the value is not equal to null, the [not] slot will return true, indicating the condition is met.
