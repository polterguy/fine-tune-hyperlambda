/*
 * The code snippet uses the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot. It targets the children of the [where] node within a [data.read] operation, adding nodes from the [.arguments] node. This effectively merges argument nodes into the query's where clause, allowing dynamic query customization based on input arguments. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified location.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] path to be added.
