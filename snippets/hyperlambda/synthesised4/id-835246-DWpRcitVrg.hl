// This code snippet uses [get-first-value] to retrieve the first non-null value from a series of evaluations. It first attempts to get a value from the [http.post] response's content, specifically targeting the finish reason of the first choice. If this value is null, it defaults to "unknown". This approach is useful for handling optional data with fallback values.
