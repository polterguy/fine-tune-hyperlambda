 * The code checks if the value of the [connection-string] node within the [.arguments] node is equal to an empty string. It uses [eq] to compare the value retrieved by [get-value] with an empty string, returning true if they are identical. 
 * 
 * 1. [eq] - Compares two values for equality.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [connection-string] node within [.arguments].
 * 3. [.] - Represents an empty string for comparison.
