// The code snippet uses the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot to a specific location in the node structure. The [get-nodes] slot fetches all nodes under [.arguments], and these nodes are then added to the path specified by the [add] slot, which is within the [where] section of a [data.read] operation. This setup allows for dynamic construction of query criteria based on input arguments.
