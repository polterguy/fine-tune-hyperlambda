// 1. `@.url`: This iterator looks for the first node named "url" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the name "url". This is useful when you need to retrieve a specific configuration or setting that is defined higher up in the node structure, such as a base URL for making HTTP requests or accessing resources.
