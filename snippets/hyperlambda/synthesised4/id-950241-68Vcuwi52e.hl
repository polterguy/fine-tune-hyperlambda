// This Hyperlambda snippet uses [set-value] to change the value of the current node to the content of a file. It retrieves the filename from the [.arguments] node using [io.file.load] to load the file's content. The [set-value] slot assigns this content to the current node, effectively replacing its existing value with the loaded file content.
