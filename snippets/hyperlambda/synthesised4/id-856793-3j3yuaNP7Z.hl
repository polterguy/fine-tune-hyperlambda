// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the name of a node to its lowercase equivalent. The [set-name] slot is used to modify the name of the node referenced by the expression [@.dp/#]. It uses [strings.to-lower] to convert the current name, obtained by [get-name], to lowercase before setting it as the new name.
set-name:x:@.dp/#
   strings.to-lower:x:@get-name
