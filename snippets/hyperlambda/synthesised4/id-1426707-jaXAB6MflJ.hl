// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append a node with a specific value to a node set. It targets the node set specified by the expression in its value, which is [@.arguments], and adds a new node with the name and value of [completion:completion] to it. The [add] slot is used to dynamically modify the structure of the node set by adding new nodes as specified.
