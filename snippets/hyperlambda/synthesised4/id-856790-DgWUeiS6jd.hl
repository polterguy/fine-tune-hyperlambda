// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [signal] slot to invoke a dynamic slot named [strings.concat]. It passes in three arguments: [connection-string], [database], and [table], each retrieved using lambda expressions. The [database] argument is specifically fetched from the [for-each] loop's current node, utilizing the [.dp] reference to access its children.
signal:x:@strings.concat
   connection-string:x:@.connection-string
   database:x:@for-each/@.dp/#/*/name
   table:x:@.dp/#/*/table
