// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a "users" table, applying a filter condition to match the "username" field with a provided argument. The [data.read] slot is used to query the database, and the [where] clause specifies the condition using [and] and [eq] to ensure that only records with a "username" equal to the supplied argument are returned.
data.read
   table:users
   where
      and
         username.eq:x:@.arguments/*/username
