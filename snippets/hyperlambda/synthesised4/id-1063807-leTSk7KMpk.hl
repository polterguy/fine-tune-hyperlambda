/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name `.dp` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.dp` specifies the exact name of the node it is looking for. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by its name within the current scope.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node obtained from the previous result set. In this context, it assumes that the value of the `.dp` node is itself another node, and it returns this node by reference. This is particularly useful when you want to manipulate or access the actual node that is stored as a value within another node, allowing you to modify the original node directly rather than working with a copy.
