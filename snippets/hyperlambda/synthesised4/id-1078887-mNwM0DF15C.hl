/*
 * 1. `@.url`: This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context with the name "url". The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and the `.` before "url" specifies that it should start the search from the current node's parent. This is useful when you want to access a specific node by name within the current scope, such as retrieving a URL configuration or endpoint from a set of parameters or settings in a Hyperlambda script. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a URL node in a configuration file to dynamically set endpoints for HTTP requests.
 * - Retrieving a URL from a set of parameters passed to a function or script for further processing or validation.
