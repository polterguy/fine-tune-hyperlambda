// The [type] slot in Hyperlambda is used to determine the type of a node's value. By specifying the type as "uint", it indicates that the node's value is an unsigned integer (System.UInt32). This is useful for ensuring that the data type is explicitly defined and understood within the Hyperlambda code, allowing for type-specific operations and validations.
