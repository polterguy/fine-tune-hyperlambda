// The code snippet uses the [time] slot to create a time span object, which is useful for performing arithmetic operations with date and time objects. It then uses the [math.subtract] slot to subtract a specified time duration from a given date or time value. The [time] slot can accept arguments such as [days], [hours], [minutes], [seconds], and [milliseconds] to define the time span.
