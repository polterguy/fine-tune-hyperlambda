// This Hyperlambda code snippet replaces occurrences of the string "[[copy_button]]" in the [.result] node with "false". It uses the [strings.replace] slot to perform the replacement operation, and the [set-value] slot to update the [.result] node with the modified string. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the string to be replaced, and the second is the replacement string.
set-value:x:@.result
   strings.replace:x:@.result
      .:[[copy_button]]
      .:false
