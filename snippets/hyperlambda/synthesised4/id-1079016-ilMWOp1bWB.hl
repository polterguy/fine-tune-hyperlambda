/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to navigate to the top of the node hierarchy from the current node. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate nodes at the root level, regardless of the current position in the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children of the root node. This is useful for iterating over or accessing all nodes directly under the root.
 * 
 * 3. `return` - This iterator filters the previous result set to include only nodes with the name "return". It is used to specifically target nodes named "return" among the children of the root node. This is useful when you want to perform operations on or retrieve information from nodes specifically named "return".
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "return" nodes. It is used to access the children of the "return" nodes, allowing further navigation or manipulation of these nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `references` - This iterator filters the previous result set to include only nodes with the name "references". It is used to specifically target nodes named "references" among the children of the "return" nodes. This is useful when you want to perform operations on or retrieve information from nodes specifically named "references".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to gather all "references" nodes that are children of "return" nodes, which are themselves children of the root node. This might be useful in a context where "references" nodes contain important data or metadata related to the "return" nodes, such as references to external resources or documentation links.
