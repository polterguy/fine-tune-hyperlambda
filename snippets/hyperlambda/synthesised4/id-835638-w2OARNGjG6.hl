// The code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of a specific node within a Hyperlambda graph. It targets a node within a data connection and reading operation, specifically the second column's alias, and sets its value to the result of a [get-value] operation that retrieves the value of an [aggregate_function] argument. This allows dynamic assignment of an alias to a column based on input parameters.
set-value:x:@data.connect/*/data.read/*/columns/1/*/as
