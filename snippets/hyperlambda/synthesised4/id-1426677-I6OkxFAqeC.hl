/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to determine the type of a node's value. The [type] slot returns the Hyperlambda type name of the specified value. In this example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to retrieve the type of the value of the node directly above it, which is [.foo]. After execution, the value of the [type] slot will be "int", indicating that the type of the [.foo] node's value is an integer.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type of the value of the node directly above it.
