// The code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a database table named "employees" using the [data.read] slot. It selects the "birth_day" column and applies a [where] condition to filter rows where the "username" column equals the value provided in the [.arguments] node under "username". The [where] condition uses the [and] slot to ensure the filtering criteria are met.
