/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [case] slot to handle multiple conditions and return a result based on the first matching condition. The [switch] slot is used to evaluate the value of the [case:nvarchar] node, and based on its value, the corresponding [case] block is executed. Each [case] block checks for a specific string value, and if a match is found, it sets the [.result] node to a predefined string. If no match is found, the [default] block sets the [.result] node to a default string. This approach allows for flexible and readable conditional branching based on string values.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Evaluates the value of the [case:nvarchar] node.
 * 2. [case] - Checks for specific string values and executes the corresponding block if a match is found.
 * 3. [default] - Executes if no [case] block matches, setting the [.result] node to a default value.
 * 4. [.result] - Stores the outcome of the executed [case] or [default] block.
