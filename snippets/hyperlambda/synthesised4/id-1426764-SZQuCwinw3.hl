// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the node named "Extra" that is a child of the node referenced by the [.dp] node. The [.dp] node is assumed to be passed in by reference, often within a loop or dynamic context, allowing you to access and manipulate the "Extra" node's value dynamically.
