// This Hyperlambda code checks if the [done_reason] node exists and is not null within the [json2lambda] node. If both conditions are true, it sets the value of [.finish_reason] to the value of [done_reason], unwraps the subsequent nodes, and sends a signal through a socket connection using the session identifier, passing the [finish_reason] as an argument.
