/*
 * The code demonstrates a switch-case structure in Hyperlambda, where it evaluates the value of the [h2] node and executes a corresponding block of code based on the matched case. It includes a [default] case to handle any unmatched values. The code is structured as follows:
 * 
 * 1. [h2] - The node being evaluated in the switch-case structure.
 * 2. [switch] - Initiates the switch-case logic.
 * 3. [case] - Defines a specific value to match against the [h2] node.
 * 4. [default] - Provides a block of code to execute if no [case] matches.
