/*
 * 1. `@.session` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node named "session". This is useful when you need to access session-related data that is stored in a node named "session" somewhere in the hierarchy above the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access user session data, such as user authentication status or session-specific variables, that is stored in a node named "session" within the current Hyperlambda execution context.
