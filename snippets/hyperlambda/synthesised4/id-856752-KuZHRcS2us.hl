 * The Hyperlambda code logs an error message "Something went wrong while invoking OpenAI" using the [log.error] slot and captures additional error details from the [lambda2hyper] slot. The [lambda2hyper] slot is used to convert a lambda object into a Hyperlambda string, which is then logged as part of the error details. 
 * 
 * 1. [log.error] - Logs an error message.
 * 2. [error] - Captures additional error details from the [lambda2hyper] slot.
