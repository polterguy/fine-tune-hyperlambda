// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Employees" and its alias "ReportsTo", based on a condition where the "ReportsTo" column in the "Employees" table matches the "EmployeeID" in the "ReportsTo" table. The [join] slot specifies the table to join, [as] assigns an alias to the joined table, [type] defines the join type as left, and [on] contains the condition for the join using the [and] slot to ensure both columns are compared.
join:Employees
   as:ReportsTo
   type:left
   on
      and
         Employees.ReportsTo:ReportsTo.EmployeeID
