// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [data.delete] slot to remove a record from the "vss_ml_training_snippets" table. It specifies a [where] clause that uses the [and] slot to ensure the deletion is conditional, specifically targeting records where the "rowid" matches the "id" argument provided. This approach ensures that only the intended record is deleted from the database.
