// The [case] slot is used within a [switch] block to define a specific condition to match against the evaluated value of the [switch] node. If the value of the [switch] node matches the value of the [case] node, the associated lambda object is executed. The [case] node must have a value, which can be a constant or an expression, and it is used to determine if the associated lambda should be executed.
