/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (the next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda) of its previous result set. It is used to move downwards in the hierarchy to the next sibling node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access the children of the current node, allowing traversal deeper into the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator again retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to further traverse into the hierarchy, accessing the children of the nodes retrieved by the previous `*` iterator.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator once more retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to continue the traversal into the hierarchy, accessing the children of the nodes retrieved by the previous `*` iterator.
 * 
 * 5. `content` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "content". It is used to specifically target nodes named "content" within the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve all nodes named "content" that are three levels deep in the hierarchy of the elder sibling of the current node. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to extract specific data from a structured document or configuration file, such as retrieving all "content" sections from a sibling node's structure.
