/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by selecting the first node in the current context that has the name "arguments". The `@` symbol indicates that it should look for a node with this specific name, and the `.` ensures it starts from the current node's context. This is useful in scenarios where you need to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot, which are typically encapsulated within an "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected "arguments" node. It allows you to access each argument individually, regardless of how many there are. This is particularly useful when you need to process or evaluate each argument separately.
 * 
 * 3. `prompt`: This final iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "prompt" among the children of the "arguments" node. This is useful when you specifically need to access or manipulate the "prompt" argument, perhaps to use it in a subsequent operation or to evaluate its value.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases**: 
 * - Extracting a specific argument named "prompt" from a set of arguments passed to a function or slot, possibly for further processing or evaluation.
 * - In an HTTP endpoint, this expression could be used to retrieve a "prompt" parameter from the request's arguments to dynamically generate a response based on its content.
