/*
 * 1. `@data.select` - This iterator looks for the first node with the name "data.select" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards and sideways in the hierarchy until it finds a match. This is useful for locating a specific node within a complex structure where the node might not be a direct child.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "data.select" node. It is used to access each child node directly under "data.select", which can be helpful when you need to process or evaluate all immediate descendants.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children of each node obtained from the previous step. This allows you to access a deeper level within the hierarchy, specifically targeting nodes that are two levels below the "data.select" node.
 * 
 * 4. `keyword_count` - This iterator filters the results from the previous step to only include nodes named "keyword_count". It is used to narrow down the node set to those specifically named "keyword_count", which is useful when you need to perform operations or evaluations on nodes with this specific name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * 
 * - Extracting or counting the number of "keyword_count" nodes within a specific section of a data structure, which can be useful in data analysis or reporting tasks.
 * - Performing operations or transformations on each "keyword_count" node, such as aggregating their values or applying specific business logic.
