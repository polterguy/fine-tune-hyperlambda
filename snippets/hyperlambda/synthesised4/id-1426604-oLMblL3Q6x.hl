/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the name of all nodes referenced by the expression [@.prop/*] to the value obtained from the node referenced by [@.dp/#/*/name]. The [set-name] slot is used to rename nodes, and [get-value] retrieves the value of the node specified in its expression. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the name of nodes referenced in its expression.
 * 2. [@.prop/*] - Expression pointing to nodes under [.prop].
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified in its expression.
 * 4. [@.dp/#/*/name] - Expression pointing to the value of the node named [name] under the node referenced by [.dp].
