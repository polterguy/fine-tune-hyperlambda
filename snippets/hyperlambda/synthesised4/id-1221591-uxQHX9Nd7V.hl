// Retrieves the younger sibling of the current node. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the node that is immediately below the current node in the Hyperlambda hierarchy. For example, if you are iterating through nodes and need to perform an operation on the next node in sequence, this expression helps in navigating to that node.
