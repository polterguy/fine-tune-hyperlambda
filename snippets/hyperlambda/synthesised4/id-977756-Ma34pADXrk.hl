// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [data.delete] slot to remove a record from the "customers" table. The deletion is conditional, specified by the [where] clause, which ensures that only the record with a "customer_id" equal to 42 is deleted. The [and] node allows for multiple conditions to be combined, but in this case, only one condition is used.
data.delete
   table:customers

      and
