/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert new nodes into a specified location within a Hyperlambda graph. It adds two nodes, [uri] and [filename], as children to the nodes referenced by the expression in the [add] slot. The values for these nodes are dynamically retrieved using expressions. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts new nodes into the specified location in the Hyperlambda graph.
 * 2. [uri] - Adds a node named [uri] with a value dynamically retrieved from the expression.
 * 3. [filename] - Adds a node named [filename] with a value dynamically retrieved from the expression.
