// 1. `@.fields`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "fields" that is found by traversing upwards from the current node in the hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves up through its ancestors and siblings until it finds the first occurrence of a node named "fields". This is useful when you want to access a specific node that is not a direct child of the current node but exists somewhere higher in the hierarchy.
