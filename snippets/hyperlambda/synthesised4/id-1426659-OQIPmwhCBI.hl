/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate a series of strings and values into a single string. It retrieves the value of the first completion node from a list of snippets, appends a newline and an exclamation mark, and then constructs a Markdown image link using the first non-null value from an alternative text node or a default "Image" text, followed by a URL. The resulting string is a Markdown-formatted image link. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.concat] - Concatenates a list of strings and values into a single string.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the first completion node from a list of snippets.
 * 3. [get-first-value] - Retrieves the first non-null value from an alternative text node or defaults to "Image".
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the URL to be used in the Markdown image link.
