// This Hyperlambda code uses the [data.execute] slot to execute a SQL DELETE statement that removes records from the "vss_ml_training_snippets" table. The deletion targets rows where the "rowid" matches the "id" from the "ml_training_snippets" table, filtered by a specific "type" and "uri" provided as arguments. The [data.execute] slot is used here because the operation does not expect any result to be returned, only the execution of the SQL statement. The arguments [@type] and [@url] are dynamically inserted into the SQL query to specify the conditions for deletion.
data.execute:@"
   delete from vss_ml_training_snippets
      where rowid in (select id as rowid from ml_training_snippets where type = @type and uri = @url)"
   @type:x:@.arguments/*/type
   @url:x:@.arguments/*/url
