/*
 * 1. `@.username`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "username" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards, checking each node's name until it finds a match. 
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is useful when you need to access a specific node named "username" that is located somewhere above the current node in the hierarchy, such as when you need to retrieve a user's name or identifier that was previously defined in the structure.
