// The Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [return-nodes] slot to return multiple nodes from a dynamically created slot. It returns nodes with integer values, specifically a [users] node with a value of 3 and a [timeout] node with a value of 30. This slot is typically used inside a dynamic slot or context that supports returning nodes.
