// The code demonstrates how to execute a batch of SQL statements using the [data.select] slot in Hyperlambda. It connects to a database and executes two SQL queries to select all records from "table1" and "table2". By setting [multiple-result-sets] to boolean true, it enables the retrieval of multiple result sets, returning an array of arrays where each sub-array corresponds to the result of one SQL statement.
data.select:select * from table1; select * from table2;
   multiple-result-sets:bool:true
