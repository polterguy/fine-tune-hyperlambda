// The code snippet demonstrates the use of a [case] node within a [switch] statement to handle specific conditions. When the [switch] evaluates to "medium", the [case] node executes, returning the string "Size is medium". This is part of a conditional branching mechanism in Hyperlambda, where different [case] nodes execute based on the evaluated value of the [switch].
case:medium
   return:Size is medium
