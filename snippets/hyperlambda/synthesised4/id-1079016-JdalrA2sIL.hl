/*
 * 1. `@signal`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "signal" from the current context. It is used to locate a specific node within the hierarchy that matches the given name.
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node(s). In this case, it retrieves all children of the "signal" node.
 * 3. `snippets`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those with the name "snippets". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes specifically named "snippets".
 * 4. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected "snippets" node(s). It is used to access all the children of the "snippets" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to gather all snippet-related data or configurations under a "signal" node, which might be part of a larger system for handling signals or events.
 * - It could be useful in a context where you need to process or analyze all code snippets associated with a particular signal in a software application.
