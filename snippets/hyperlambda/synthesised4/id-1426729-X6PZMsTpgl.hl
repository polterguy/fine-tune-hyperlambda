/*
 * The Hyperlambda code adds a new snippet to an existing collection of snippets. It does this by using the [add] slot to append a new node to the [.snippets] node. The new node contains two child nodes: [prompt] and [completion], which are populated with values from existing nodes in the graph. This structure is typically used for storing prompt-completion pairs, possibly for machine learning or automation tasks.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends a new node to the [.snippets] collection.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the new snippet node being added.
 * 3. [prompt] - Retrieves and assigns the value from the [.prompt] node.
 * 4. [completion] - Retrieves and assigns the value from the [.completion] node.
