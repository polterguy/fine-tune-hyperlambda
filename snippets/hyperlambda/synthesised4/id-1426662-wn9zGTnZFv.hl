/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes to a specified location within a lambda object. It uses the [add] slot to append a new node structure under a targeted path, which is determined by a lambda expression. The snippet creates a new node named [foo] with two child nodes, [loc] and [files], whose values are dynamically retrieved using lambda expressions.
 * // 1. [add] - Adds a new node structure to the specified location in the lambda object.
 * // 2. [.] - Represents the root node for the new structure being added.
 * // 3. [foo] - The name of the new node being added.
 * // 4. [loc] - A child node of [foo], with its value set by a lambda expression.
 * // 5. [files] - Another child node of [foo], also with its value set by a lambda expression.
