/*
 * 1. `@.fields`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `fields` within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it should search for a node by name, and the `.` symbol specifies that it should start the search from the current node's level in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression is useful for retrieving a specific node named `fields` that is a sibling or a direct child of the current node, which could be used to access or manipulate data stored within that node.
