/*
 * 1. `@.has-sockets`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "has-sockets" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It stops as soon as it finds the first match. This is useful for checking if a certain feature or configuration (in this case, "has-sockets") is present in the hierarchy, which might be used to determine if certain functionality should be enabled or if specific logic should be executed based on the presence of this node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to verify if a certain configuration (like socket support) is enabled in a broader context, such as a server or application settings, before proceeding with operations that require socket connections.
