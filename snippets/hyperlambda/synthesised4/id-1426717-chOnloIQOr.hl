// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node exists at a specific path, ensures that a "cached" child node is not null, and verifies that the integer value of the "cached" node is greater than zero. It uses the [and] slot to combine these conditions, returning true only if all are satisfied. Specifically, it performs the following checks: 1) [exists] checks for the presence of a node at [@.scan/0], 2) [not-null] ensures the "cached" node under [@.scan/0/*] is not null, and 3) [mt] compares the integer value of the "cached" node to zero, confirming it is greater.
