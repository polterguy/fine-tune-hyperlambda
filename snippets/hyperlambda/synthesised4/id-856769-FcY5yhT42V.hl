// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes into a destination node. The code adds a node with a name determined by the value of the [prefix-url] argument to the children collection of the [data.select] node, which is a child of the [data.connect] node. The [add] slot evaluates its children before appending them, allowing for dynamic node creation based on expressions.
