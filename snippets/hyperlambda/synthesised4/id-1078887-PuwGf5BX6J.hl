/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by locating the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for the node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. The [.arguments] node typically contains the arguments passed to a function or slot, making this a common starting point for accessing input parameters.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or slot, allowing the subsequent iterators to filter or manipulate these nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `max` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named [max]. It is used to specifically target a node named [max] among the children of the [.arguments] node, which is likely intended to represent a maximum value or limit parameter.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - The expression can be used in a function or slot to retrieve the value of a [max] parameter passed as an argument. This could be useful in scenarios where a maximum limit needs to be enforced, such as limiting the number of iterations in a loop or constraining a numerical value within a certain range.
