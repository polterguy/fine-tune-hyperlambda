/*
 * 1. `@http.post` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "http.post". It is used to locate the starting point of the expression within the Hyperlambda structure, specifically targeting the "http.post" node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "http.post" node. It is used to access any child nodes under "http.post", regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `content` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "content". It is used to narrow down the search to nodes specifically named "content" among the children of "http.post".
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "content" node. It is used to access any child nodes under "content", regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 5. `error` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "error". It is used to narrow down the search to nodes specifically named "error" among the children of "content".
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "error" node. It is used to access any child nodes under "error", regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 7. `message` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "message". It is used to locate the specific node named "message" among the children of "error".
 * 
 * Use cases: 
 * - This expression can be used to extract error messages from an HTTP POST response in a Hyperlambda structure. It is useful for logging, debugging, or displaying error messages to users when handling HTTP responses.
