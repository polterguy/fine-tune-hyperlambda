 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet updates the value of a node named [.url] with the value retrieved from a specific node in the current context. It uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of [.url] to the value obtained from the [get-value] slot, which references a node with an attribute [href] in the current context.
 * // 1. [set-value:x:@.url] - Changes the value of the [.url] node to the result of its child node.
 * // 2. [get-value:x:"@.dp/#/*/\\@href"] - Retrieves the value of a node with an attribute [href] from the current context, specifically from a node referenced by [.dp].
