/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "signal" from the current context. It is used to locate a specific node in the hierarchy based on its name.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. It allows you to access every direct child of the "signal" node, regardless of their names.
 * 3. `snippets` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "snippets" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It ensures that only nodes named "snippets" are selected from the children of the "signal" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to gather all "snippets" nodes under a specific "signal" node in a Hyperlambda graph. For example, it could be part of a process to extract code snippets associated with a particular signal for further processing or display.
 * - Another use case might be in a logging or monitoring system where "snippets" represent log entries or alerts associated with a "signal," and you need to collect and analyze these entries.
