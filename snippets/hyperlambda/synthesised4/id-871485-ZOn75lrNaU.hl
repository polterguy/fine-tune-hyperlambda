// The Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database to read data from the "Doctors" table. It specifies columns to select, including an aggregate function aliased as "result". A "where" condition is included, and the query limits the result to one record. The [database-type] slot specifies the database type, [table] indicates the table name, [columns] defines the columns to select, [where] sets conditions, and [limit] restricts the number of records returned.
