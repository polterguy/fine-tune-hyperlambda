// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] statement to define a specific condition to match against. When the value of the [switch] expression matches the value of a [case] slot, the associated lambda block is executed. This allows for conditional branching based on multiple potential values, similar to a switch-case construct in other programming languages.
