/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current context. It starts the expression by locating this node, which serves as the base for subsequent iterations. This is useful when you want to start your search from a specific node within your structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. It expands the search to include every child node under "signal", allowing the expression to consider all possible paths for further filtering. This is useful when you need to process or evaluate all elements under a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `private-key` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to only include those named "private-key". It narrows down the search to nodes specifically named "private-key", effectively isolating these nodes from others. This is useful in scenarios where you need to access or manipulate specific data elements, such as retrieving a private key for encryption or decryption purposes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include accessing a private key stored within a "signal" node for cryptographic operations, ensuring secure data handling, or managing encryption keys in a structured data format.
