// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database table named 'clients'. It specifies the use of a distinct function on the columns, renaming the result to a default alias. The [where] clause is prepared for additional conditions using logical [and] operations, allowing for refined query filtering.
