// The Hyperlambda code sets an HTTP response header to control caching behavior. It uses the [response.headers.set] slot to specify a "Cache-Control" header with a value of "public, max-age=300", indicating that the response can be cached by any cache and should be considered fresh for 300 seconds. This is useful for optimizing performance by reducing server load and improving response times for frequently accessed resources.
