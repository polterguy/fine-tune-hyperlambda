// The [not] slot negates the boolean result of its child condition, which in this case is an [eq] slot. The [eq] slot checks if the value obtained from the [get-value] slot, which points to the [dflt_value] node under the [.dp] node, is equal to an empty value. If they are equal, [eq] returns true, but [not] negates this result, effectively checking if the value is not equal to an empty value.
