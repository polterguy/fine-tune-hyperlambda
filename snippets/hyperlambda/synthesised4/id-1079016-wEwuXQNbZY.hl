/*
 * 1. `@.prompt`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "prompt" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it should search for a node with the specified name, and the `.` implies that it should start the search from the current node's parent. This is useful when you want to retrieve a specific node that is a sibling or a direct child of the current node's parent. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a configuration or setting node named "prompt" that is defined at the same level as the current node.
 * - Accessing a node that contains instructions or metadata relevant to the current operation, which is stored alongside the current node in a structured data format.
