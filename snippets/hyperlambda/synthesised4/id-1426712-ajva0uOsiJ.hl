// This Hyperlambda code checks if any child node under the [data] node within the [.arguments] node has a non-null value. If at least one child node has a value, the [not-null] slot will evaluate to true; otherwise, it will evaluate to false. This is useful for validating that certain data has been provided as part of the arguments.
