// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to query a MySQL database. It specifies the table "transactions" and limits the result set to 20 records. The results are sorted by the "transaction_date" column in ascending order. The [database-type] slot ensures the query is compatible with MySQL syntax.
data.read
   database-type:mysql
   table:transactions
   limit:20
   sort:transaction_date
