/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" from the current node's context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or a slot in Hyperlambda. This is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate input parameters for a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It allows you to access each argument passed into the function or slot, regardless of their names. This is useful for iterating over all arguments or performing operations on them collectively.
 * 
 * 3. `prefix` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "prefix" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target an argument named "prefix" to retrieve its value or perform operations on it.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used in a dynamic slot or HTTP endpoint to retrieve the value of an argument named "prefix" that has been passed into the function. This is useful when you need to perform operations or validations specifically on the "prefix" argument, such as appending it to another string or using it as a key in a data structure.
