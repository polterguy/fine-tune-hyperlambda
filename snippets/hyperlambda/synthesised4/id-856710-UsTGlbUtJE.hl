// This Hyperlambda code snippet increments the value of the node pointed to by [.loc] by the count of all descendant nodes of the node returned by the [hyper2lambda] slot. The [math.increment] slot is used to increase the value in place, while [get-count] calculates the number of descendant nodes from the result of [hyper2lambda].
