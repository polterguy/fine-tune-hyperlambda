/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator looks for the first node named `.dp` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors and siblings.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the `.dp` node is itself a node, and it returns this node by reference. This allows for modifications to be made directly to the original node, rather than a copy of it.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is typically used in a [for-each] loop where `.dp` is a placeholder for the currently iterated node. The `#` iterator is used to access the node's value directly, allowing for operations or modifications to be performed on the actual node being iterated over.
