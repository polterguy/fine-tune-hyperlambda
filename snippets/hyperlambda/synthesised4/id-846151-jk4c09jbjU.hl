// This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL read operation on the "users" table, joining it twice with the "users_extra" table using aliases "ue1" and "ue2". It selects specific columns, including "username" and "password" from "users", and values from "users_extra" as "email" and "name". The [where] clause filters results based on conditions, ensuring "ue1.type" is "email", "ue2.type" is "name", and "users.username" matches the authenticated user's username.
