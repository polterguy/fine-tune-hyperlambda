/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It's used to navigate up the hierarchy to find the "arguments" node, which typically contains input parameters or configuration settings for the current context.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each parameter or configuration setting provided under the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `filter-on-url` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "filter-on-url". It is used to specifically target and retrieve the node that contains the "filter-on-url" parameter or setting.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda script to dynamically access and process a specific configuration or input parameter named "filter-on-url" from a set of arguments. This might be useful in scenarios where the script needs to apply filtering logic based on a URL pattern or parameter provided as input.
