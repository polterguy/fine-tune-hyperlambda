/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions. The first condition checks if the [has-sitemap] node under [signal] is false using [eq]. The second condition verifies if the count of nodes under [urls] is zero using [get-count] and [eq]. Both conditions must be true for the [and] slot to evaluate to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Combines multiple conditions, evaluating to true only if all conditions are true.
 * 2. [eq] - Checks if the value of [has-sitemap] is false.
 * 3. [get-count] - Counts the number of nodes under [urls].
 * 4. [eq] - Checks if the count of nodes under [urls] is zero.
