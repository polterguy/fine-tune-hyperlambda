// This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL query on a SQLite database, joining the "Appointments" table with "Patients" and "Doctors" tables using left joins. It selects specific columns from each table, including "AppointmentID", "PatientID", "DoctorID", "AppointmentDate", and "Reason" from "Appointments", and the first names from "Patients" and "Doctors", using aliases for the latter. The query includes a [where] clause for filtering results, but the specific conditions are not provided. The [database-type] is specified as SQLite, indicating the database being queried.
