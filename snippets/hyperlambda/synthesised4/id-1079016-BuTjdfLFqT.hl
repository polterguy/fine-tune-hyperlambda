/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node. It moves one level down in the hierarchy to the next node, which is useful when you want to access the node that follows the current node in the same parent context.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. After moving to the elder sibling with the `+` iterator, `*` will get all the children of that sibling node. This is useful for accessing all elements or properties under a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - The second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the result set obtained from the first `*`. This allows you to access all descendants two levels deep from the elder sibling node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to navigate through a structured data set where you need to process or analyze elements that are two levels deep under the next sibling node. For instance, in a configuration file or data structure where settings or parameters are nested, this expression could help in extracting or modifying those nested elements.
