/*
 * This Hyperlambda code processes files with specific conditions, checking if a file path ends with ".md" and contains "/ts-templates/". If true, it loads the file, splits its content by newline, and extracts the first line as a "prompt". The remaining content is joined back into a "completion". Both "prompt" and "completion" are trimmed of whitespace, and the result is added to a ".result" node. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if both conditions in its children are true.
 * 2. [and] - Combines multiple conditions to be true.
 * 3. [strings.ends-with] - Checks if the file path ends with ".md".
 * 4. [strings.contains] - Checks if the file path contains "/ts-templates/".
 * 5. [load-file] - Loads the file content if conditions are met.
 * 6. [strings.split] - Splits the file content by newline.
 * 7. [.prompt] - Creates a node for the prompt.
 * 8. [set-value] (prompt) - Sets the first line as the prompt after trimming.
 * 9. [.completion] - Creates a node for the completion.
 * 10. [remove-nodes] - Removes the first line from the split content.
 * 11. [set-value] (completion) - Joins the remaining lines into a completion.
 * 12. [strings.trim] - Trims whitespace from the completion.
 * 13. [unwrap] - Evaluates expressions within the completion.
 * 14. [add] - Adds the prompt and completion to the result node.
