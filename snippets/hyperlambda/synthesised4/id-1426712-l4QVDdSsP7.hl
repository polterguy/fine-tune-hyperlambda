// This Hyperlambda code snippet retrieves the value of the [api_key] node from the [.arguments] node collection. The [get-value] slot is used with an expression to navigate the node hierarchy and extract the value associated with the [api_key] node, which is assumed to be a child of the [.arguments] node. This is useful for accessing specific argument values passed into a Hyperlambda function or endpoint.
