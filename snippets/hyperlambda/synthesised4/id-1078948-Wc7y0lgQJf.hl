/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is used to locate the `.arguments` node, which typically contains arguments or parameters passed into a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each individual argument or parameter node contained within the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `.callback` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `.callback`. It is used to specifically locate a node named `.callback` among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where a callback function or handler is passed as an argument to a slot or function, and the expression is used to retrieve this callback for execution or further processing.
 * - It might be used in an event-driven architecture where different callbacks are registered and need to be dynamically accessed and invoked based on certain conditions or events.
