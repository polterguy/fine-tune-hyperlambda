// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [data] exists within the [.arguments] node, is not null, and is not equal to an empty value. The [and] slot ensures all these conditions are true for the block to evaluate to true. The [exists] slot checks for the presence of the node, [not-null] ensures it has a value, and [neq] confirms the value is not empty.
