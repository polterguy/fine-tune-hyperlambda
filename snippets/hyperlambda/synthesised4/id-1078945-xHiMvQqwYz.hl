 * 1. `@.no-invocation`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no-invocation" in the current node's hierarchy, starting from the current node and moving upwards. It does not traverse sibling nodes, only direct ancestors. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - To check if a specific node named "no-invocation" exists in the hierarchy, which might be used as a flag or configuration setting.
 * - To retrieve configuration or metadata information stored in a node named "no-invocation" that affects the current operation or logic.
