// 1. `@.database-type`: This iterator searches for the first node named "database-type" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, checking each node's name until it finds a match. This is useful when you need to retrieve configuration or metadata that is defined higher up in the node structure, such as a database type setting that might be used across multiple parts of an application.
