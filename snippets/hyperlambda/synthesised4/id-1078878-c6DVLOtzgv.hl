/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is often used to access the top-level node of the current context, which can be useful for operations that need to evaluate or modify the root node or its descendants.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it is used to access all children nodes of the root node. This is useful when you want to perform operations on all child nodes without filtering by name.
 * 
 * 3. `return` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "return". It is used to specifically target nodes named "return" among the children of the root node.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "return" nodes. It is used to access all children of the "return" nodes, which might contain additional data or nodes that need to be processed.
 * 
 * 5. `candidates` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "candidates". It is used to specifically target nodes named "candidates" among the children of the "return" nodes.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "candidates" nodes. It is used to access all children of the "candidates" nodes, which might contain further nested data or nodes.
 * 
 * 7. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access all children of the nodes retrieved so far, allowing for deeper traversal into the node hierarchy.
 * 
 * 8. `expression` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "expression". It is used to specifically target nodes named "expression" among the deeply nested children nodes.
 * 
 * 9. `={@.x}` - This is a value comparison iterator that retrieves nodes with a value equal to the value of the node referenced by `@.x`. It is used to find nodes whose value matches a specific dynamic value, which is useful for conditional logic or filtering based on dynamic criteria.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include searching for specific "expression" nodes within a deeply nested structure where the value of these nodes matches a dynamically determined value. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to extract or process specific expressions from a complex data structure based on runtime conditions.
