// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the node referenced by the [.dp] node to "selected". The [.dp] node is typically used in iteration contexts, such as [for-each], to represent the current node being processed. The [set-value] slot modifies the value of the referenced node, which is passed by reference using the [#] iterator.
