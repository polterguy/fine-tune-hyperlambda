/*
 * 1. `@.feedback-channel`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "feedback-channel" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. This is useful for retrieving configuration or context-specific data that is defined higher up in the node hierarchy, such as a feedback channel setting that might be used for logging or user feedback purposes. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a configuration setting for a feedback channel that is defined at a higher level in the hierarchy.
 * - Accessing a common resource or setting that multiple nodes need to reference, ensuring consistency across different parts of the application.
