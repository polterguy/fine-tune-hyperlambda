/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate upwards in the hierarchy to access the parent node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "data.read" from the previous result set. It is used to filter nodes by their name, specifically looking for nodes named "data.read".
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Similar to the second item, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node, which in this case are the children of the "data.read" node.
 * 
 * 5. `where` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "where" from the previous result set. It is used to filter nodes by their name, specifically looking for nodes named "where".
 * 
 * 6. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node, which in this case are the children of the "where" node.
