// This Hyperlambda code snippet updates the value of a node by appending a string to its current value. The [set-value] slot is used to modify the node's value, and [strings.concat] concatenates the current value of the node with the string " - needs restocking". The [get-value] slot retrieves the current value of the node being referenced.
