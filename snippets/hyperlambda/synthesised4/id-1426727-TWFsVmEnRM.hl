// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied with an expression that uses the "+" iterator, which retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node. The "/**" part is a wildcard that retrieves all descendant nodes of the elder sibling. This setup allows for evaluating and processing all descendant nodes of the next sibling node before proceeding with further execution.
unwrap:x:+/**
