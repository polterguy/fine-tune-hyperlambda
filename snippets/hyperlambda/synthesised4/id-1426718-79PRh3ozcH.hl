 * This Hyperlambda code deletes a specified file, where the file path is dynamically determined by the value of the [.filename] node. It will throw an exception if the file does not exist. The [io.file.delete] slot is used to perform the deletion, with its expression pointing to the [.filename] node to retrieve the file path.
 * 
 * 1. [io.file.delete] - Deletes the file specified by the path retrieved from the [.filename] node.
 * 2. [x:@.filename] - Expression to dynamically retrieve the file path from the [.filename] node.
