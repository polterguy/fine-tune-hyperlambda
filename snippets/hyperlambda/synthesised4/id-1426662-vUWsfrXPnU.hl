/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code iterates over each node resulting from the expression [@signal/*]. For each node, it checks if the node's value ends with ".hl". If the condition is true, it converts the node's value from Hyperlambda text to a semantic lambda object using [hyper2lambda]. It then increments the value of [.loc] by the count of nodes in the resulting lambda object and increments the value of [.files] by one. This code is useful for processing a collection of nodes, converting specific ones to lambda objects, and keeping track of the number of lines of code and files processed. 
 * 
 * 1. [for-each] - Iterates over each node resulting from the expression [@signal/*].
 * 2. [if] - Checks if the current node's value ends with ".hl".
 * 3. [strings.ends-with] - Determines if the current node's value ends with ".hl".
 * 4. [hyper2lambda] - Converts the current node's value from Hyperlambda text to a semantic lambda object.
 * 5. [math.increment] - Increments the value of [.loc] by the count of nodes in the resulting lambda object.
 * 6. [get-count] - Retrieves the count of nodes in the resulting lambda object.
 * 7. [math.increment] - Increments the value of [.files] by one.
