/*
 * The code demonstrates how to use the [case] slot with a [rowversion] column in a SQL query. It shows how to handle conditional logic within SQL statements using Hyperlambda, allowing for dynamic SQL generation based on specific conditions. This approach is useful for managing concurrency and versioning in database operations.
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Initiates a conditional logic block for SQL generation.
 * 2. [rowversion] - Specifies the column type being used in the conditional logic, typically for concurrency control.
