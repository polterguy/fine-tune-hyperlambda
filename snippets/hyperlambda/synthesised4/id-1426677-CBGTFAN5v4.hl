// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied with an expression that uses the "+" iterator, which refers to the elder sibling of the current node. The "/*" part indicates that all children nodes of the elder sibling should be unwrapped. This means that before the node containing this [unwrap] invocation is reached, all children nodes of the elder sibling will be evaluated, and their values will be available for use in the current context. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions within a lambda object before execution.
