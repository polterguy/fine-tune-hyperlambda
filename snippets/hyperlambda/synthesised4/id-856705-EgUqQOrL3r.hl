// The code uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace newline characters ("\n") with spaces (" ") in the string located at the [.anchor] node. This operation effectively removes line breaks from the specified string, consolidating the text into a single line. The first argument specifies the target string, while the second and third arguments define the substring to find and its replacement, respectively.
