/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] in the current execution context. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot, especially in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. This is useful for iterating over or accessing all argument nodes provided to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `from` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [from] among the children of the [.arguments] node. It is used to specifically access the value of the [from] argument if it exists.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing the "from" argument in a dynamic slot or HTTP endpoint to determine the origin of a request or operation.
 * - Filtering or processing data based on the "from" argument provided in a function call.
