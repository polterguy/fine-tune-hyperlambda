// The code uses the [remove-nodes] slot to delete all nodes within the current context that match the specified expression. It targets nodes that are descendants of the [signal] node, specifically those with a child node named [db] having a value of "mysql". This operation effectively cleans up or filters out specific nodes based on their value within a hierarchical structure.
