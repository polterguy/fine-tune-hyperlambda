// The Hyperlambda code performs a SQL query on a SQLite database, joining the "Medications" table with the "Patients" table using a left join on the "PatientID" column. It selects an aggregated column, renaming it as "result", and applies a where clause with unspecified conditions. The query limits the result to one record. Key slots include [data.read] for reading data, [join] for table joining, [columns] for selecting specific columns, and [limit] for restricting the number of returned records.
