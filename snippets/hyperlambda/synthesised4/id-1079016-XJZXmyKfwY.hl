/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "result" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node named "result". This is useful when you want to access a specific node's value or properties that have been defined earlier in the Hyperlambda code.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve the result of a computation or operation that was stored in a node named "result" earlier in the code. For example, if a series of calculations were performed and the final output was stored in a "result" node, this expression would allow you to access that output for further processing or validation.
