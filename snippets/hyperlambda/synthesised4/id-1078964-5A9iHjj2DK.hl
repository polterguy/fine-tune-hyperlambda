/*
 * 1. `@.return` - This iterator starts with an `@`, which means it looks for the first node with the name "return" in the current context. The `.` before "return" indicates that it should start the search from the current node's parent, moving upwards in the hierarchy. This expression will return the first "return" node it encounters in the current context. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access or modify the value of a "return" node within a Hyperlambda graph, particularly in a dynamic slot or a function where the "return" node is used to yield a result.
