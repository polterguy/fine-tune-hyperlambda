// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to create a new record in the "Customers" table of a SQLite database using the [data.create] slot. The [database-type] specifies the type of database, which is SQLite in this case, and the [table] specifies the table name where the record will be inserted. The [values] node will contain the fields and their corresponding values for the new record.
