/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append a new node with the name "parameters" to all children of the nodes referenced by the expression "@.buffer/*/*". The [add] slot is used to dynamically modify the structure of a Hyperlambda node tree by adding new nodes to it. In this example, the expression "@.buffer/*/*" targets all grandchildren nodes of the [.buffer] node, and the new node "parameters" is added as a child to each of these targeted nodes.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends a new node to the nodes specified by the expression.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the new node to be added, named "parameters".
