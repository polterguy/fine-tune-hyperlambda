// This Hyperlambda code updates the value of the [.result] node by concatenating its current value with the SQL statements retrieved from a [data.select] operation. The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine these values, appending a newline character at the end. The [get-value] slots fetch the current [.result] value and the SQL statements from the [data.select] operation, ensuring that the final [.result] value includes all concatenated SQL statements separated by a newline.
