/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named ".arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda, especially in the context of HTTP endpoints or dynamic slot executions.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the ".arguments" node. It is used to access all the argument nodes that are direct children of the ".arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `/username` - This iterator filters the result set to include only the nodes named "username" among the children of the ".arguments" node. It is useful for extracting a specific argument value, in this case, the "username" argument, from the list of arguments.
