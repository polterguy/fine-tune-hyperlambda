/*
 * This Hyperlambda code concatenates the string "Bearer " with the value retrieved from the configuration file using the key "magic:openai:key". The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine these two strings, where the first part is a static string and the second part is dynamically fetched from the configuration settings. The result is typically used for constructing an authorization header for HTTP requests, where the concatenated string represents a Bearer token. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.concat] - Concatenates a list of strings specified as children nodes.
 * 2. [.] - Static string "Bearer " to be concatenated.
 * 3. [config.get] - Retrieves the value associated with the key "magic:openai:key" from the configuration file.
