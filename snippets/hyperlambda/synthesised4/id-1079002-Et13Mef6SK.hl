/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator searches for the first node named [.dp] in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you want to work with a specific node that might be a sibling or an ancestor of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the [.dp] node. It assumes that the value of [.dp] is another node, and it retrieves this node by reference. This is often used when you want to modify or access the original node rather than a copy of it.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It is used here to access all child nodes of the node that was de-referenced in the previous step. This is useful when you want to perform operations on or analyze all children of a specific node.
 * 
 * 4. `data_type` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named [data_type]. It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes with a specific name, which is useful when you are interested in nodes that represent a particular type of data or category.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to analyze or manipulate nodes of a specific data type within a dynamically passed node (via [.dp]), such as when processing a collection of data entries and filtering them based on their type.
 * - It could also be used in a validation routine to ensure that all nodes of a certain type meet specific criteria or to extract and process them in a particular way.
