/*
 * 1. `@data.select` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "data.select" in the current context. It's useful for pinpointing a specific node by name, especially when you know the exact name of the node you're looking for.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node(s). In this context, it fetches all children of the "data.select" node. It's commonly used to explore or operate on all direct descendants of a node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of each node returned by the previous `*` iterator. This effectively means it's fetching all grandchildren of the "data.select" node. This is useful when you need to delve deeper into a node hierarchy to access nested structures.
 * 
 * 4. `keyword_count` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "keyword_count". It's used to narrow down the node set to those that match a specific name, allowing for precise targeting of nodes within a larger structure.
