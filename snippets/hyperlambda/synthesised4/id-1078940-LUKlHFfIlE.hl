/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" from the current context. The ".dp" node is typically used in loops or iterations to refer to the current node being processed. In this context, it is likely used to access a specific node structure that is being iterated over or evaluated.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the ".dp" node, which is expected to be another node. This allows the expression to work with the actual node referenced by the value of ".dp", rather than just a copy of it.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous step. It is used to access the entire set of child nodes under the de-referenced node.
 * 
 * 4. `"{@.arguments/*/prompt}"` - This is an extrapolated expression that evaluates to a specific value. The expression `@.arguments/*/prompt` retrieves the value of the "prompt" node within the ".arguments" node. The result of this evaluation is used as a dynamic filter to match nodes with names equal to the evaluated value.
 * 
 * 5. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node matched by the dynamic filter in the previous step. It is used to further drill down into the structure to access deeper nested nodes.
 * 
 * 6. `\#text` - This iterator retrieves the node with the name "#text" among the children of the previously matched nodes. It is used to access a specific node, likely containing text data or a string value.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * 
 * - Extracting a specific piece of text from a complex data structure where the path to the text is dynamically determined by a "prompt" argument. This could be useful in scenarios where the structure of the data is known, but the exact node to be accessed is determined at runtime.
 * - Implementing a dynamic content retrieval system where the content to be extracted is specified by a user or external input, allowing for flexible data processing based on user-defined criteria.
