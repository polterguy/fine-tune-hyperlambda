// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda, which executes its child nodes when none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are met. In this case, the [else] block contains a [throw] slot, which throws an exception with a message taken from the value of the node referenced by the expression [x:@.dp/#]. This approach is useful for handling default cases or errors when no other conditions are satisfied.
