// The [add] slot is used to append nodes to a specified destination node's children collection. In this example, it adds all child nodes of the [.src] node to the [.dest] node's children collection by using [get-nodes] to retrieve the source nodes. The [add] slot evaluates the children nodes of the [get-nodes] invocation before appending them to the destination.
