 * The provided Hyperlambda code changes the name of all nodes referenced by its main expression to the value retrieved from the specified argument. The [set-name] slot targets nodes using an expression, while [get-value] fetches the value of the [group_column] argument, which is then used as the new name for the targeted nodes. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the name of nodes referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [group_column] argument.
