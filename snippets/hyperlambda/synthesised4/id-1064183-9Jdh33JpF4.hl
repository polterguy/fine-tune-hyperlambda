/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda HTTP endpoint or a dynamically executed slot, where arguments are passed in as children of this node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument passed into the Hyperlambda function or endpoint, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `aggregate_column` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `aggregate_column` from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically access the argument or parameter named `aggregate_column`, which might be used for operations like aggregation in the context of data processing or querying.
