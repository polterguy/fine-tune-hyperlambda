// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a table named "ml_training_snippets" using the [data.read] slot. It specifies multiple columns to be selected, including an alias for the "embedding" column as "embedding_vss". The [where] clause is prepared for filtering conditions using logical operators [and] and [or], allowing for complex query conditions. The code is structured to retrieve specific fields from the database table, potentially for use in machine learning model training or analysis.
