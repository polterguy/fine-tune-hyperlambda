/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context that has the name "arguments". It is used to access the [.arguments] node, which typically contains parameters or data passed into a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any parameters or data that are direct children of the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "session". It is used to specifically access the "session" node within the children of the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a web application to retrieve session-related data passed into an HTTP endpoint, allowing the endpoint to perform operations based on the current session's state or data. 
 * - It might also be used in a function to access session-specific parameters for processing or validation purposes.
