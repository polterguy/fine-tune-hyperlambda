/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the [system_message] node within the [.arguments] node is not null and not equal to an empty string. If both conditions are true, it unwraps the content from a specific path and adds a new node to the [.session] node with a role of "system" and the content from the [system_message]. The code uses [if] for conditional execution, [and] for combining conditions, [not-null] and [neq] for checking the presence and value of [system_message], [unwrap] for evaluating expressions, and [add] to append a new node to the session. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional block that executes if the condition is true.
 * 2. [and] - Combines multiple conditions that must all be true.
 * 3. [not-null] - Checks if the [system_message] node is not null.
 * 4. [neq] - Checks if the [system_message] node is not equal to an empty string.
 * 5. [.lambda] - Contains the operations to execute if the condition is true.
 * 6. [unwrap] - Evaluates expressions to retrieve content.
 * 7. [add] - Appends a new node to the [.session] node.
 * 8. [role] - Sets the role of the new node to "system".
 * 9. [content] - Sets the content of the new node to the value of [system_message].
