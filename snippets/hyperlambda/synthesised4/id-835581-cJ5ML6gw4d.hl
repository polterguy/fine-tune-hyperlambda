/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a collection. It retrieves nodes specified by expressions pointing to [order] and [direction] within the [.arguments] node using [get-nodes], and appends them to the [data.read] node. The process involves fetching specific nodes and adding them to another node's children.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified node.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes based on the expression provided.
 * 3. [order] - Node being retrieved from [.arguments].
 * 4. [direction] - Another node being retrieved from [.arguments].
