// The code demonstrates the use of the [strings.mixin] slot, which combines and evaluates inline Hyperlambda expressions within a string. It takes arguments [arg1] and [arg2], and the result of the inline Hyperlambda is mixed into the surrounding string, allowing dynamic string composition.
strings.mixin:x:-
   arg1:int:2
   arg2:int:3
