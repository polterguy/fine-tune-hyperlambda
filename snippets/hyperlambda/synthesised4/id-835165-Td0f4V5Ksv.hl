// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to authenticate a user using the [magic.auth.authenticate] slot. It extracts the username and password from the [.arguments] node, which are expected to be provided as arguments, and uses these credentials to perform the authentication process. If successful, it returns authentication details.
execute:magic.auth.authenticate
   username:x:@.arguments/*/username
   password:x:@.arguments/*/password
