 * 1. The first iterator, [+], retrieves the next sibling node (the node immediately below the current node at the same indentation level).
 * 2. The second iterator, [*], retrieves all children of the previously selected sibling node.
 * 3. The third iterator, [*], retrieves all children of each of those child nodes.
 * 
 * The overall effect is to select all grandchildren (children of children) of the next sibling node relative to the current node.
