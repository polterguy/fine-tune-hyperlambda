/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if the number of child nodes under the [.urls] node is less than 10,000. It uses the [get-count] slot to count the nodes and the [lt] slot to compare the count with 10,000. 
 * 
 * 1. [lt] - Compares two values and returns true if the first is less than the second.
 * 2. [get-count] - Returns the number of nodes pointed to by its expression.
 * 3. [@.urls/*] - Expression pointing to all child nodes of the [.urls] node.
 * 4. [int:10000] - The integer value 10,000 used for comparison.
