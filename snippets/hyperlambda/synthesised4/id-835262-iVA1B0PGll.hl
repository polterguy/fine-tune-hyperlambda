// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [validators.default] slot to ensure default values for specific arguments within a node collection. It checks if the nodes [images], [lists], and [code] exist as children of the node collection specified by the expression. If any of these nodes do not exist, they are appended with a default boolean value of true. If they exist but have a null value, their value is set to true. This ensures that these nodes always have a valid boolean value, facilitating consistent behavior in subsequent operations that depend on these settings.
