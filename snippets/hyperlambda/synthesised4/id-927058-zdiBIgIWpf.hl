// The code demonstrates the use of an [if] slot to evaluate a condition and execute a lambda object if the condition is true. In this example, the [if] slot checks a boolean condition which is set to false. Since the condition is false, the lambda object containing the [set-value] slot to update the [.result] node with the value "One" will not be executed.
