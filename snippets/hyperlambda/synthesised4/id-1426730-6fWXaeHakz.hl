// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the first node resulting from a [strings.split] operation. The [get-value] slot is used with an expression pointing to the first element (index 0) of the node set produced by [strings.split]. This allows you to access and utilize the first segment of a string that has been split into multiple parts.
get-value:x:@strings.split/0
