// The [unwrap] slot in this Hyperlambda code is used to forward evaluate the expressions specified in its value. It processes the nodes pointed to by the expression, evaluating them before the current node is reached during execution. The expression "x:+/*/*" navigates the node structure to determine which nodes to evaluate. This is useful for pre-evaluating expressions in a lambda object, ensuring that their values are resolved before the lambda object is executed.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
