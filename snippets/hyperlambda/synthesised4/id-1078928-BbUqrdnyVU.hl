/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary, but it will not traverse siblings.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. It is used to access the next level of nodes directly under "signal".
 * 
 * 3. `snippets` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "snippets" from the previously retrieved children nodes of "signal".
 * 
 * 4. `0` - This iterator retrieves the first child node of the "snippets" node. In a zero-based index system, this means it selects the first node in the list of children under "snippets".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access a specific snippet of code or data stored under a "signal" node, particularly when dealing with a collection of snippets and you are interested in the first one.
 * - It might be used in a logging or debugging context where the first snippet of a signal needs to be evaluated or processed.
