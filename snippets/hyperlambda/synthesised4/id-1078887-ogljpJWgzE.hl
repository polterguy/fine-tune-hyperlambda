// 1. `@.cur`: This iterator searches for the first node named "cur" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, checking each node's name. This is useful for retrieving a specific node that is expected to be found in the current context or its ancestors, such as when you need to access configuration or state information stored in a node named "cur".
