/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the hierarchy of the current node structure.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children nodes of the parent node obtained from the previous iterator.
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "data.read" from the children nodes retrieved by the previous iterator. 
 * 
 * This expression is used to navigate from the current node to its parent, retrieve all children of that parent, and then filter those children to find a node named "data.read". This could be useful in scenarios where you need to access or manipulate data specifically associated with a "data.read" node within a larger node structure.
