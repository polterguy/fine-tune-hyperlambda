// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [math.increment] slot to increase the value of a node. The [math.increment] slot takes an expression pointing to a node, in this case, [.even-count], and increments its value by 1. This operation modifies the value of the node in place, effectively increasing the count or number stored in [.even-count] by one.
math.increment:x:@.even-count
