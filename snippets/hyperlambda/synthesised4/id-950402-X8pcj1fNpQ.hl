// The code demonstrates the use of the [if] slot in Hyperlambda to evaluate a boolean condition. If both conditions evaluate to true, the [set-value] slot is executed, setting the value of the [.result] node to "OK". The [if] slot requires two arguments: the condition and the [.lambda] block, which is executed if the condition is true.
if
   .:bool:true
   .:bool:true
   .lambda
      set-value:x:../*/.result
         .:OK
