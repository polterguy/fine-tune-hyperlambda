// This Hyperlambda code snippet performs a loop to insert records into the "vss_ml_training_snippets" table from the "ml_training_snippets" table, where the "embedding" is not null, and a specific "type" is provided. It continues executing until fewer than 500 records are inserted in one batch, at which point it stops the loop. The code uses [while] to iterate, [data.connect] to establish a connection, [data.execute] to run the SQL command, [if] to check the number of inserted records, and [set-value] to update the loop condition.
