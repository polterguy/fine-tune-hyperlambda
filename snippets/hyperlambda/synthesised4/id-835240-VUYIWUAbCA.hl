 * The code reads a stream from a file, converts the JSON content of the stream into a lambda object, and appends it to a node. It uses [io.stream.read] to read the file stream, [json2lambda] to convert JSON to lambda, and [add] to append the converted data to [file-data]. 
 * 1. [io.stream.read] - Reads the stream from the file argument.
 * 2. [json2lambda] - Converts the JSON content from the stream into a lambda object.
 * 3. [add] - Appends the converted lambda object to the [file-data] node.
