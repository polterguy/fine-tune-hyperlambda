// This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a placeholder string within a target string. The [strings.replace] slot targets the node referenced by [@.result] and replaces occurrences of the string "[[greeting]]" with the value obtained from the [get-value] slot pointing to [@.greeting]. The process involves retrieving the value of the [greeting] node and substituting it into the specified location within the result node.
strings.replace:x:@.result
   .:[[greeting]]
   get-value:x:@.greeting
