 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to access the arguments node, which typically contains input parameters or data for the current operation.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It allows you to access each argument passed to the current operation.
 * 3. `file` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "file". It is used to specifically target the "file" argument, which might contain a file path, name, or other file-related data.
