// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda to handle a default case. If none of the previous conditions are met, it sets the value of the [response] node to "Unsupported request" using the [set-value] slot. This ensures that a response is always provided, even if no specific conditions are satisfied.
