// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to construct a SQL "WHERE" clause using the [and] slot to combine conditions. It checks if the value of a column named "column1" is equal to null using the [eq] slot. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple conditions, and the [eq] slot is used for equality comparison, specifically checking if "column1" is null.
and
   column1.eq:null
