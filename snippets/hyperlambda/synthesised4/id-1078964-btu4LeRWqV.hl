/*
 * 1. `@.has-sitemap`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "has-sitemap" starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy. It stops as soon as it finds the first match. This is useful for checking if a specific node exists in the hierarchy, which could be used to determine if a sitemap is present in the current context or configuration. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a web application to verify if a sitemap is configured or available for a particular section of the site, allowing for conditional logic based on the presence or absence of the sitemap.
