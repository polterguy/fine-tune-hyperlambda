/*
 * 1. `@.no-invocation`: This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "no-invocation" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name, especially when its position in the hierarchy is not fixed.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving configuration settings or parameters stored in a node named "no-invocation" that might be located at various levels of the hierarchy.
 * - Accessing a node that contains metadata or control information relevant to the current execution context.
