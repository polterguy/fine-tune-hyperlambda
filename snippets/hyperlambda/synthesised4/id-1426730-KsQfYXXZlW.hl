// The [case:*] node in Hyperlambda acts as a wildcard case within a [switch] statement, matching any value that hasn't been explicitly matched by other [case] nodes. This allows for a flexible default behavior when no specific case is met, similar to a [default] node but can be used alongside other [case] nodes with specific values.
