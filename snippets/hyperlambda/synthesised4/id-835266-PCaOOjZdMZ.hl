// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node it's referenced in is reached, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, [unwrap] is used to evaluate the expression [x:+/**] before the node is executed, ensuring the node's value is set to the evaluated result.
unwrap:x:+/**
