// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database named "accountsdb" and reads from the "users" table. It filters the records to find a user with an ID equal to 42, limiting the result to a single record. The [data.connect] slot establishes the connection, while [data.read] specifies the table and conditions for the query. The [where] clause with [id.eq] ensures only the user with the specified ID is selected.
