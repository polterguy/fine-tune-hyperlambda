// The code uses the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve all nodes that are the result of a [sort] operation. The [get-nodes] slot takes an expression pointing to the nodes to be retrieved, which in this case are the nodes sorted by the [sort] slot. This allows for further manipulation or inspection of the sorted nodes.
