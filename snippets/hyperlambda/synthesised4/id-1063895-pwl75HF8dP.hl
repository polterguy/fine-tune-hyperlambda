// 1. `-`: This iterator retrieves the previous result set's younger sibling, which is the node directly above it in the Hyperlambda structure. It is used to navigate to the previous node at the same hierarchical level. This can be useful when you want to access or manipulate a node that is a sibling of the current node, allowing you to traverse the structure horizontally.
