/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using a left join between the "EmployeeTerritories" and "Employees" tables in an SQLite database. It specifies the join condition on the "EmployeeID" field and selects distinct values from the result set. The code also sets up a placeholder for additional conditions in the "where" clause. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.read] - Initiates a read operation from a database.
 * 2. [database-type] - Specifies the type of database being used, in this case, SQLite.
 * 3. [table] - Indicates the primary table, "EmployeeTerritories", for the query.
 * 4. [join] - Defines a left join with the "Employees" table.
 * 5. [as] - Aliases the join with "EmployeeID".
 * 6. [type] - Specifies the join type as "left".
 * 7. [on] - Sets the join condition.
 * 8. [and] - Combines multiple join conditions.
 * 9. [columns] - Lists the columns to be selected.
 * 10. [distinct_functor] - Selects distinct values from the result set.
 * 11. [as] - Aliases the distinct values.
 * 12. [where] - Placeholder for additional filtering conditions.
 * 13. [and] - Combines multiple conditions in the "where" clause.
