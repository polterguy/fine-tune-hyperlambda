/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "endswith" in the current node's hierarchy, starting from the current node and moving upwards. It will not traverse sibling nodes, only direct ancestors. This is useful for finding configuration or context nodes that are defined higher up in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - To check if a specific configuration or setting named "endswith" exists in the current context or any of its parent contexts.
 * - To retrieve a value or node associated with a specific operation or condition named "endswith" that might be defined at a higher level in the hierarchy.
