// This Hyperlambda code is executed as part of an `else` block, which performs the following operations: 1. It initializes an [embedding] node. 2. It sets the value of the [embedding] node by concatenating a string representation of an array, where the elements are joined from the [embedding] nodes within the HTTP POST response. 3. It connects to a database using [data.connect] with a specified connection string, and updates the [ml_training_snippets] table by setting the [embedding] column to the value of the [embedding] node for the row where the [id] matches the current data point. 4. It increments the value of a [success] node by one.
