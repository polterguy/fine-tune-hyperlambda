// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node. The expression [set-value:x:@.dp/#] targets the node referenced by [.dp] and updates its value to "found". The [#] iterator is used to dereference the node value, allowing direct modification of the original node.
set-value:x:@.dp/#
   :found
