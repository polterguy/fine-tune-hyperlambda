// This Hyperlambda code snippet is used to handle a specific case, identified by the node name [case] with a value "js". It sets the value of the [.handle] node to true, indicating that the case is being handled. Then, it appends the string "Programming language: JavaScript" to the existing value of the [.file-meta] node using the [strings.concat] slot. This effectively updates the metadata to include information about the JavaScript programming language.
