/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of a specific node within a data structure to the value of an argument. It navigates through a node hierarchy starting from [data.connect], accessing the second column's alias in a SQL query, and assigns it the value of the [aggregate_function] argument. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of a node.
 * 2. [x:@data.connect/*/data.read/*/columns/1/*/as] - Expression pointing to the node whose value is being set.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a node.
 * 4. [x:@.arguments/*/aggregate_function] - Expression pointing to the [aggregate_function] argument whose value is retrieved.
