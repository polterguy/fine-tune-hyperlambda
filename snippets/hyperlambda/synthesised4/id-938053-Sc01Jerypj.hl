// The provided Hyperlambda code uses the [yield] slot to return the nodes obtained from the [data.read] operation. The [yield] slot is typically used within dynamic slots or files to return values or node lists, and in this case, it returns all records fetched by the [data.read] operation, which is referenced by the expression `x:@data.read/*`.
