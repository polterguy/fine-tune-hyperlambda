/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. It is used to access the arguments node, which is typically used to pass parameters or data into a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument passed into the function or slot, allowing for iteration or further filtering.
 * 
 * 3. `foreignTable` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "foreignTable". It is used to specifically target the "foreignTable" node among the children of [.arguments], which could represent a specific parameter or data structure related to a foreign table in a database context.
