 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context that matches the specified name. In this case, it looks for the first node named "num" within the current scope or hierarchy.
 * 2. `.num` - This specifies the name of the node that the `@` iterator is searching for. It indicates that the expression is looking for a node named "num" at the current level or higher in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * This expression is useful for accessing a specific node named "num" within a Hyperlambda graph, allowing you to retrieve or manipulate its value or children nodes.
