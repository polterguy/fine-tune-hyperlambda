/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy. It's useful for accessing the arguments node in a Hyperlambda structure, often used in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints to retrieve input parameters.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current result set, which in this case is the "arguments" node. It's used to access all the parameters or settings defined under the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `folder` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "folder". It's used to specifically target and retrieve the "folder" parameter or setting from the list of arguments.
