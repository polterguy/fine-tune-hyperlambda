/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "result" that is located before the current node in its hierarchy. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node named "result". This is useful for accessing a specific node that holds a result value, which might be needed for further processing or evaluation in the Hyperlambda code. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing the result of a previously executed operation to use it in subsequent calculations or logic.
 * - Retrieving a result value to log it or return it as part of a response in a web service.
