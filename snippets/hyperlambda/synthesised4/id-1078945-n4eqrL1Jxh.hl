/*
 * 1. `@.tmp-completion`: This iterator looks for the first node named "tmp-completion" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards through its ancestors and siblings. This is useful when you need to find a specific node by name that is not necessarily a direct child or descendant of the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve a temporary result or data stored in a node named "tmp-completion" that is part of a larger operation or process, allowing you to access or manipulate this data further.
