// The [and] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate multiple boolean conditions, returning true only if all conditions are true. It short-circuits, meaning it stops evaluating further conditions once a false condition is encountered. This slot is useful for creating complex logical expressions by combining multiple conditions that must all be true for the overall expression to evaluate to true.
