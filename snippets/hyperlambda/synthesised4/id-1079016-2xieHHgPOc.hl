/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator searches for the first node named "session" within the current execution context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful for accessing session-related data that might be stored in a node named "session" within the current Hyperlambda graph. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving session information such as user credentials or session-specific settings.
 * - Accessing session variables that are used to maintain state across different parts of a Hyperlambda application.
