// The code snippet demonstrates how to add a node to a session object in Hyperlambda. It uses the [add] slot to insert a new node into the [.session] node. The newly added node contains a [.role] child node with the value "system" and a [content] node whose value is retrieved from a [context] node within a [signal]. The [add] slot facilitates the modification of the session object by appending new data to it.
add:x:@.session

         role:system
         content:x:@signal/*/context
