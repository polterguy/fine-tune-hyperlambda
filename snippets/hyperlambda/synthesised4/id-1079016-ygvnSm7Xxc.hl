/*
 * 1. `@json2lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "json2lambda" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by its name.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node (in this case, the "json2lambda" node). It is used to access all direct descendants of a node.
 * 
 * 3. `done_reason` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to return only those with the name "done_reason". It is used to find specific nodes among the children of "json2lambda" that have the name "done_reason".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to extract the "done_reason" information from a JSON structure that has been converted to a Hyperlambda node structure, particularly useful in scenarios where you need to understand why a certain process or operation was completed.
 * - It could be used in logging or debugging to capture and analyze the reasons for completion of various tasks or processes represented in a JSON-like structure.
