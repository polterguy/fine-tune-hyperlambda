// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-name] slot to change the name of all nodes referenced by its expression [x:@.prop/*] to the value obtained from the [get-value] slot, which retrieves the name of the node currently iterated by reference through [.dp]. The [get-value] slot expression [x:@.dp/#/*/name] accesses the name of the node being iterated over, allowing dynamic renaming based on existing node values.
set-name:x:@.prop/*
   get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/name
