/*
 * 1. `@lambda2json` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "lambda2json" in the current context. It is used to directly access a node by its name, starting from the current node and moving through its siblings and their descendants.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve the "lambda2json" node from a Hyperlambda structure, which might contain data or logic related to converting a lambda structure into JSON format. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to serialize a Hyperlambda node structure into JSON for data interchange or storage.
