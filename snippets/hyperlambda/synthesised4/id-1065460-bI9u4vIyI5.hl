// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it should search for a node by name, and the "." implies that it should start the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate a specific node named "sql" within the current scope of your Hyperlambda code.
