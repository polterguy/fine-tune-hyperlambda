/*
 * 1. `@data.read`: This iterator looks for the first node named "data.read" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards and sideways in the hierarchy to find the node with this specific name. This is useful when you want to start your search from a specific node in the hierarchy that might not be a direct parent or sibling.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.read" node. It is used to navigate deeper into the hierarchy, allowing access to any direct children nodes under "data.read".
 * 
 * 3. `*`: The second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of each node found by the previous iterator. This allows for a deeper traversal into the hierarchy, accessing grandchildren nodes of "data.read".
 * 
 * 4. `name`: This iterator filters the results from the previous step to only include nodes named "name". It selects nodes with this specific name from the set of grandchildren nodes under "data.read".
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to extract all "name" nodes that are grandchildren of a "data.read" node. This might be useful in scenarios where "name" nodes contain specific information or identifiers that need to be processed or displayed, such as extracting user names from a data structure representing a collection of user profiles.
