// The [return-nodes] slot is used to return a collection of nodes from a dynamic slot or a context that explicitly supports returning nodes. In this example, it returns all nodes that are the result of evaluating the expression [@data.read/*/*], effectively returning all child nodes of each node under [data.read].
