// This Hyperlambda code snippet retrieves the fingerprint and public key from a previously created RSA key pair. The [return] slot is used to return these values, where [fingerprint] points to the fingerprint of the public key, and [public_key] retrieves the public key itself from the RSA key creation process.
return
   fingerprint:x:@crypto.rsa.create-key/*/fingerprint
   public_key:x:@crypto.rsa.create-key/*/public
