// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert nodes into an existing node structure. It targets a specific node using an expression and adds two new child nodes: [tokens] with an integer value of 4096, and [chat] with a boolean value of false. This allows for dynamic modification of the node graph by appending new data elements.
