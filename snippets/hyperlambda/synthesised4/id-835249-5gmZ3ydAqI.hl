// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes from a JSON converted to lambda structure into a file execution context. It retrieves nodes using [get-nodes] from the result of a [json2lambda] conversion and adds them to the execution context of a file specified by [execute-file]. This allows for dynamic inclusion of JSON data into a Hyperlambda execution flow.
