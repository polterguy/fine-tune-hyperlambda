// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else-if] slot in Hyperlambda to compare two values. If the left-hand side (LHS) value is greater than the right-hand side (RHS) value, the [else-if] condition evaluates to true, and the lambda object is executed, setting the [.result] node's value to 1. This is part of a conditional branching structure where multiple conditions are evaluated in sequence.
