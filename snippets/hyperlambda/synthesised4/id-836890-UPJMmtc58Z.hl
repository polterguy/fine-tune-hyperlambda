// This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database and performs a read operation on the "opportunities" table, joining it with the "clients" table using a left join on the "client_id" field. It selects the count of records and limits the result to one record. The code also dynamically adds nodes to the "where" clause from the arguments and returns the nodes from the read operation. Key slots include [data.connect] for establishing the connection, [data.read] for querying, and [return-nodes] for returning the query results.
