// The [unwrap] slot is used to forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied as a value to unwrap itself. In this case, it evaluates the expression to retrieve the task ID from a specific path in the node structure. The expression `x:./*/tasks.create/*/*/.task-id` navigates through the node hierarchy to find and return the value of the [.task-id] node within a [tasks.create] node.
unwrap:x:./*/tasks.create/*/*/.task-id
