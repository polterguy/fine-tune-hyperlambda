/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a new node to the "candidates" node under the "return" node. It creates a new node with children nodes "name" and "expression", both of which have their values set to the value of the node referenced by the expression "@.x". Additionally, it includes a "complete" node with a boolean value of true.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node to the specified location.
 * 2. [name] - Sets the name of the new node to the value of the node referenced by "@.x".
 * 3. [expression] - Sets the expression of the new node to the value of the node referenced by "@.x".
 * 4. [complete] - Sets the "complete" node's value to true.
