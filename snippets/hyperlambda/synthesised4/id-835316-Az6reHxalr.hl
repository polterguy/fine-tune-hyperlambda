// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this case, it evaluates the expression [x:+/*/*/*/content], which navigates through the node structure to find and unwrap the value of the [content] node. This allows the [content] node's value to be accessed and used before the execution reaches the node.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*/content
