// 1. `@.database-type`: This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "database-type" within the current node's context. The `@` symbol indicates that it should search for a node by name, and the `.` symbol specifies that it should start the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate the value of a specific node named "database-type" within the current scope of your Hyperlambda code.
