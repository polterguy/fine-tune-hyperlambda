// This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates a conditional check using the [if] slot to compare two values. It uses the [lt] slot to determine if the value of [.lhs] is less than [.rhs]. If true, it sets the [.result] node's value to -1 using [set-value]. This is typically part of a sorting mechanism to indicate the order of elements.
