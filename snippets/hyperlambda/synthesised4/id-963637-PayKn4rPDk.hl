// This Hyperlambda code connects to the "sakila" database and executes a SQL SELECT query to retrieve the first and last names of actors whose first names match a specified filter. The filter is dynamically set using a value from the arguments node. The results of the query are then returned using the yield slot.
data.connect:sakila
   data.select:SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor WHERE first_name LIKE @filter
      @filter:x:@.arguments/*/name
