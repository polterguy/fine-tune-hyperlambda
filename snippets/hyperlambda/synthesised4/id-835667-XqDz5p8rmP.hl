// The code changes the name of all nodes referenced by the expression to a concatenated string. The [set-name] slot targets nodes using the expression [x:+/+/*/*], and [strings.concat] combines a static string "p" with the value obtained from [get-value:x:@.no]. The result is used as the new name for the targeted nodes.
