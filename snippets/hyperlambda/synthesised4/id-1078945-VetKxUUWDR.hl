/*
 * 1. `@execute` - This iterator looks for the first node named "execute" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by its name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "execute" node. It is used to access the children of a node, allowing further traversal or operations on those child nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `result` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find nodes specifically named "result". It is used to narrow down the node set to only those nodes that have the name "result".
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "result" nodes. It allows access to the children of the "result" nodes, enabling further operations or data extraction from those child nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to extract or manipulate data from the children of "result" nodes that are themselves children of an "execute" node. This might be useful in scenarios where the "result" nodes contain specific output or data that needs to be processed or evaluated further.
