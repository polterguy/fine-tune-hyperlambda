/*
 * This expression is a Hyperlambda expression that navigates through a node structure. Let's break down each part of the expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@sqlite.select`: This part of the expression starts by looking for the first node named `sqlite.select`. The `@` symbol indicates that it should find the first occurrence of a node with this specific name in the current context or hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: The asterisk `*` is a wildcard iterator that retrieves all children of the node found in the previous step. In this case, it retrieves all children nodes of the `sqlite.select` node.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: The second asterisk `*` is another wildcard iterator that retrieves all children of each node retrieved in the previous step. This means it goes one level deeper, retrieving all children of each child node of `sqlite.select`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to extract all nested data within a `sqlite.select` node, which might be useful when processing SQL query results or configurations stored in a Hyperlambda structure.
 * - It can be used to gather and manipulate all sub-elements of a SQL selection operation, possibly for logging, debugging, or further data transformation tasks.
