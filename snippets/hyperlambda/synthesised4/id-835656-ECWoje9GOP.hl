// This Hyperlambda snippet changes the names of nodes located at a specific path to a concatenated string. The [set-name] slot targets nodes at the path [./*/data.read/*/columns/*/aggregate_functor] and assigns them a new name created by concatenating the value of [aggregate_function] and [aggregate_column] from [.arguments], separated by parentheses. The [strings.concat] slot is used to perform the concatenation.
