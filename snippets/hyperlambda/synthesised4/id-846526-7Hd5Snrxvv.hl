// This Hyperlambda code snippet iterates over a set of nodes and changes their values to lowercase. It uses [set-value] to modify the value of each node referenced by [.dp] to the result of [strings.to-lower], which converts the current node's value to lowercase. The [strings.to-lower] slot is applied to the value of the node currently being iterated over, ensuring all characters are transformed to lowercase.
