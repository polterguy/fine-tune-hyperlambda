/*
 * 1. `@.function-result`: This iterator searches for the first node named "function-result" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and the `.` before "function-result" specifies that it should start the search from the current node's level in the hierarchy. This expression is often used to retrieve the result of a function or operation that has been stored in a node named "function-result".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the output of a previously executed function or operation within a Hyperlambda script.
 * - Accessing the result of a computation or process that has been stored in a node named "function-result" for further processing or evaluation.
