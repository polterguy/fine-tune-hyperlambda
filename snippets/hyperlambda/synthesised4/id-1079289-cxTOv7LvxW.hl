/*
 * 1. `@.no` - This iterator searches for the first ancestor node with the name "no". It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node named "no". This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is guaranteed to be an ancestor of the current node, such as when you have a nested structure and you want to retrieve a configuration or setting node that applies to the current context. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: If you have a configuration node named "no" that contains settings relevant to the current operation, you can use this expression to retrieve those settings regardless of the current depth in the node hierarchy.
