/*
 * 1. `@.text`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "text" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It begins its search from the current node's position and moves upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a match. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a specific piece of text data that has been defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure.
 * - Retrieving configuration or metadata information that is stored in a node named "text" and needs to be used in subsequent operations.
