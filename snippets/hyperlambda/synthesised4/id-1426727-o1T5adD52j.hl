// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [type] slot to retrieve the type of a node's value. In this example, a node named [.foo] is declared with an integer type and a value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to determine the type of the node directly above it, which in this case is [.foo]. The result of executing the [type] slot will be the string "int", indicating that the type of the [.foo] node is an integer. This can be useful for dynamically checking or validating the types of values within a Hyperlambda script.
