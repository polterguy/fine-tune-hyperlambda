/*
 * This Hyperlambda code changes the name of nodes within a specific path in a data structure. It uses [set-name] to modify the name of nodes located at [@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column] to the value obtained from [get-value] at [@.arguments/*/group_column]. This operation is useful for dynamically renaming nodes based on argument values, allowing for flexible data manipulation and transformation. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the name of nodes specified by its expression.
 * 2. [@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column] - Path expression pointing to the nodes to be renamed.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 4. [@.arguments/*/group_column] - Path expression pointing to the argument value used for renaming.
