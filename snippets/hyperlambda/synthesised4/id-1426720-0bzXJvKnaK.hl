/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.token] node to the value retrieved from the [api_key] node located within the data structure accessed by the [data.read] slot. The [set-value] slot is used to assign the retrieved value to [.token], while the [get-value] slot is used to fetch the [api_key] value. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.token] node to the value retrieved by the [get-value] slot.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value from the [api_key] node within the data structure accessed by [data.read].
