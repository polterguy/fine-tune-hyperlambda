/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named [.arguments] starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is used to locate the [.arguments] node, which typically contains the input parameters or arguments for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access the individual argument nodes within the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `user_id` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [user_id]. It is used to specifically target the [user_id] argument within the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to retrieve the value of the [user_id] argument passed to it. It is useful for operations that require user identification, such as authentication, authorization, or logging user-specific actions.
