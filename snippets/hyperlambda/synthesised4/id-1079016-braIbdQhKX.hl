/*
 * 1. `@.to` - This iterator looks for the first node with the name "to" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it starts the search from the current node. This is typically used to retrieve a specific node when you know its name and want to access its value or children nodes directly.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a node named "to" to retrieve its value, which could be an email address or a recipient in a messaging system.
 * - Navigating to a specific node in a configuration or data structure where the node's name is known.
