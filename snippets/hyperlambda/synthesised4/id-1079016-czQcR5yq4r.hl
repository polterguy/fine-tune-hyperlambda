/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda. This is often the starting point for accessing input parameters in a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument passed to the function or slot, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `stream` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes that have the name "stream". It is used to specifically target a parameter or argument named "stream" within the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or HTTP endpoint to access a specific argument named "stream" that is passed to it. This is useful in scenarios where you need to perform operations on a data stream or handle streaming data as part of the slot's logic.
