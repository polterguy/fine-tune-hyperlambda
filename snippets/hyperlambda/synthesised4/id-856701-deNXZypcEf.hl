// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [not] slot to negate the result of a [strings.ends-with] operation. It checks if the value of the node referenced by [@.token] does not end with the string obtained from [@.endswith]. If the string does not end with the specified sequence, the [not] slot will evaluate to true.
