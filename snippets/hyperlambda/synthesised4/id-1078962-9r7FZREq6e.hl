/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument provided to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `html` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "html". It is used to specifically target the "html" argument among potentially many arguments.
 * 
 * **Use Cases:**
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to access an "html" argument that was passed in, allowing the function to perform operations specifically on the HTML content provided.
 * - It could be used in an HTTP endpoint to retrieve and process HTML content passed as an argument, such as rendering a template or sanitizing the HTML for security purposes.
