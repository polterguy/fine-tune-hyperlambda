// 1. `@.json`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "json" from the current context. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy until it finds a node named "json". This is useful for accessing configuration or data nodes that are named "json" in a structured data set, especially when dealing with JSON data representations in Hyperlambda. A potential use case might be extracting a JSON configuration node to use its value for further processing or manipulation within the Hyperlambda script.
