// This Hyperlambda code iterates over the results of a [strings.split] operation, trimming whitespace from each element, and then adds each trimmed email address to the "to" field of an SMTP email message. It uses [for-each] to loop through each split string, [strings.trim] to remove leading and trailing spaces, [unwrap] to evaluate nested expressions, and [add] to append the processed email addresses to the email's recipient list.
