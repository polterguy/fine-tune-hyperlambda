/*
 * This Hyperlambda code connects to a database and inserts a record into a table named "ml_training_snippets". The record contains fields for "type", "prompt", "completion", and "uri". The "type" field is dynamically set from another node, while the "prompt" and "completion" fields contain specific text related to an AI chatbot created by AINIRO.IO. The "uri" field contains a URL pointing to AINIRO.IO's website. The code ensures that the data is inserted safely into the database using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.connect] - Opens a database connection using the specified connection string and database name.
 * 2. [data.create] - Initiates the creation of a new record in the specified table.
 * 3. [table] - Specifies the name of the table where the record will be inserted.
 * 4. [values] - Contains the fields and values to be inserted into the table.
 * 5. [type] - Sets the "type" field's value dynamically from another node.
 * 6. [prompt] - Sets the "prompt" field's value with a specific question about the AI chatbot.
 * 7. [completion] - Sets the "completion" field's value with a detailed description of the AI chatbot.
 * 8. [uri] - Sets the "uri" field's value with a URL pointing to AINIRO.IO's website.
