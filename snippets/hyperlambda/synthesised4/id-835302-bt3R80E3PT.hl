/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a specific node's child named [is_nullable] has a value of "NO". If the condition is true, it adds a new node with a [nullable] child set to false to the [.tmp] node. The code uses [if] for conditional execution, [eq] for equality comparison, and [add] to append a new node structure. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Executes its child nodes if the condition is true.
 * 2. [eq] - Checks if the value of [is_nullable] is "NO".
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [is_nullable] node.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 5. [add] - Adds a new node to the [.tmp] node.
 * 6. [nullable] - Sets the [nullable] node's value to false.
