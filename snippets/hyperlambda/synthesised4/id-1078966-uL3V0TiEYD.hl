/*
 * 1. `@.urls` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named "urls" that is an ancestor of the current node. It will traverse upwards in the hierarchy to locate this node. This is useful when you want to access a specific node that may not be a direct parent but is somewhere up in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - Once the "urls" node is found, this iterator retrieves all of its children nodes. This is useful when you want to perform operations on all child nodes of a specific parent node, such as iterating over them or extracting their values.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a collection of URLs stored as child nodes under a parent node named "urls", and you want to retrieve and process each URL individually. For example, you might use this expression to iterate over a list of URLs to check their validity or to fetch data from each URL.
