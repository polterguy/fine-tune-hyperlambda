/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "new-prompt" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will not traverse sibling nodes, only direct ancestors. This is useful when you want to find a specific node that is an ancestor of the current node, ensuring that you are referencing the correct part of the graph structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving configuration or settings stored in a parent node named "new-prompt".
 * - Accessing a common data node that is shared among multiple sibling nodes but is defined as an ancestor.
