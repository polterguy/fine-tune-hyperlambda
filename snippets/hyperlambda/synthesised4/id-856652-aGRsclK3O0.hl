// The code retrieves the value of a node specified by its expression. It uses the [get-value] slot to access a node's value, navigating through a series of iterators to pinpoint the exact node. The expression starts at the [.dp] node, dereferences its value, and then traverses through its children to find a node named "verb". This allows for dynamic retrieval of node values within a structured data graph.
get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/verb
