// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.select] slot to execute a SQL query that retrieves the first and last names from the "actor" table where the first name matches a specified pattern. The pattern is provided through the [@filter] argument, which is dynamically set to the value of the [name] node from the [.arguments] node. This allows for flexible querying based on user input or other dynamic data sources.
data.select:SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor WHERE first_name LIKE @filter
   @filter:x:@.arguments/*/name
