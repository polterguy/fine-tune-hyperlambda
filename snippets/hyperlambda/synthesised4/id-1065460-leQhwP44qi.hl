/*
 * 1. `@data.connect` - This iterator searches for the first node named "data.connect" in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further navigation within the node structure. This is useful when you want to perform operations or retrieve information starting from a specific node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "data.connect" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "data.connect" node, allowing you to perform operations on or retrieve information from each of these child nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `data.select` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "data.select" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to narrow down the node set to those specifically named "data.select", which is useful when you need to perform operations or retrieve information from nodes with this specific name.
