// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [eval] slot to execute a lambda object. The [eval] slot takes an expression pointing to a node, in this case, [.process], and executes all of its children nodes sequentially. This allows for dynamic execution of code blocks defined elsewhere in the Hyperlambda graph, facilitating modular and reusable code structures.
