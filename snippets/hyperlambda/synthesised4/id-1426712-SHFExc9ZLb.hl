/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sends a SignalR event using the [sockets.signal] slot to notify all connections associated with the current session. The event includes an argument [function_error] with the message "Too many function invocations". This is useful for alerting clients about specific issues or states related to their session, such as exceeding a limit on function calls. The [args] node contains the data to be transmitted to the subscribers as a JSON string. 
 * 
 * 1. [sockets.signal] - Sends a SignalR event to all connections associated with the current session.
 * 2. [args] - Contains the data to be transmitted with the event.
 * 3. [function_error] - A key-value pair within [args] indicating an error message about too many function invocations.
