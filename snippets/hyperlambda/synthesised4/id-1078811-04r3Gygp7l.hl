/*
 * 1. `@.corrupt`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "corrupt" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for locating specific nodes in a complex structure, such as when you need to check or modify the value of a node named "corrupt" that might be located at various levels within the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases include:
 * - Checking if a node named "corrupt" exists in a data structure to determine if data corruption has occurred.
 * - Accessing the "corrupt" node to retrieve or modify its value, such as resetting it or logging its state for debugging purposes.
