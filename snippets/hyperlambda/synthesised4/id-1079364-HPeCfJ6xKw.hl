// 1. `@.no` - This iterator looks for the first node with the name "no" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first occurrence of such a node it finds. This is useful when you need to access a specific ancestor node named "no" without traversing siblings, only direct ancestors. A potential use case could be to check or retrieve a configuration or setting that is defined higher up in the hierarchy, such as a flag or a parameter that determines whether a certain feature or functionality should be enabled or not.
