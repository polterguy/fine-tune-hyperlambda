// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to modify the value of a node by trimming whitespace from both ends of a string. It uses the [strings.trim] slot to perform the trimming operation on the node referenced by the expression in [set-value]. The result is that the node's value is updated to the trimmed version of its original string.
