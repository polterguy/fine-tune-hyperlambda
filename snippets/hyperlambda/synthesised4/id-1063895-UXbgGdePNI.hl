/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named [.arguments] starting from the current node and traversing upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda HTTP endpoint or a dynamic slot, where input parameters are stored.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any parameter nodes that might be passed as arguments to the slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `/databaseName` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find the first node with the name [databaseName]. It is used to specifically access the value of the [databaseName] argument, which might be required for operations involving database connections or queries.
