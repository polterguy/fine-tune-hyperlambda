/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else-if] slot to evaluate a condition. It checks if the value of the [.value] node is equal to 2 using the [eq] slot. If the condition is true, it executes the [.lambda] block, setting the [.result] node's value to "Two". The [else-if] slot is typically used after an [if] or another [else-if] block to provide additional conditional logic. 
 * 
 * 1. [else-if] - Evaluates the condition only if previous conditions were false.
 * 2. [eq] - Checks if the value of [.value] is equal to 2.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [.value] node.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 5. [set-value] - Sets the value of [.result] to "Two" if the condition is met.
