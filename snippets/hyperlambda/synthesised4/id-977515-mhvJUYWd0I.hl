// This Hyperlambda code connects to a PostgreSQL database named "inventory_db" and inserts a new record into the "products" table. It specifies the database type as PostgreSQL for both the connection and the data creation operation. The record includes fields for "product_id", "name", "price", and "stock", with respective values of 2005, "Laptop", 999.99, and 50. The [data.connect] slot establishes the connection, and the [data.create] slot performs the insertion.
