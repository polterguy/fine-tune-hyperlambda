// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the node referenced by the expression [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/Key] is equal to the static string "PRI". If the value matches, the [eq] slot will evaluate to true. The code is typically used to perform conditional checks based on the value of a specific node within a data structure.
