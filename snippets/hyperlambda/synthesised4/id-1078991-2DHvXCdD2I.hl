/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. It is often used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda script, which typically contains input parameters or configuration settings for the script.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access all the nodes that are direct children of the `.arguments` node, which might represent individual arguments or parameters passed to the script.
 * 
 * 3. `pkLength` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `pkLength`. It is used to find a specific argument or parameter named `pkLength` among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda script to retrieve the value of a specific argument named `pkLength` that is passed to the script. This might be useful in scenarios where the script needs to perform operations based on the length of a primary key or some other parameter defined by `pkLength`.
