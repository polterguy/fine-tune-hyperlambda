// The code demonstrates the use of the [if] slot in Hyperlambda to evaluate a condition. It checks if the condition is true, and if so, executes the lambda object that sets the value of the [.result] node to "Condition is true". The [if] slot requires a boolean condition and a [.lambda] node containing the actions to perform if the condition is met.
