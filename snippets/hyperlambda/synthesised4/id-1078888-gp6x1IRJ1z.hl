/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" from the current context. It is often used to access a specific node that is expected to be present in the current scope, typically used in loops or dynamic slot executions to reference the current node being processed.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator dereferences the value of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is another node or a reference to a node, allowing direct access to this referenced node. This is useful when the value of a node is a complex object or another node structure that needs to be accessed.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing operations or further filtering on these children nodes.
 * 
 * 4. `\@href` - This iterator retrieves all nodes with the name "href" from the result set of the previous iterator. It is used to filter out nodes that do not match the specified name, focusing on nodes that are specifically named "href". This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to extract specific attributes or elements from a collection of nodes, such as extracting all hyperlink references from a set of HTML elements.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting all hyperlink references from a dynamically generated list of HTML elements, where each element is represented as a node in a Hyperlambda structure.
 * - Processing a collection of data nodes where each node may contain a reference or URL that needs to be accessed or validated.
