/*
 * 1. `@.cur`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "cur" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will not traverse siblings but will only check the current node and its ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific node named "cur" that might be defined at a higher level in the node hierarchy, such as a configuration or a context-specific value that is set earlier in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: Retrieving a configuration value or a context-specific variable that is set at a higher level in the hierarchy, such as a currency code or a current user session identifier.
