// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] slot to evaluate multiple conditions. It checks if the condition [enabled.eq] is true, which implies that the [enabled] node's value is equal to true. The [and] slot will only evaluate to true if all its child conditions are true. In this case, it evaluates a single condition, making it effectively a simple equality check.
