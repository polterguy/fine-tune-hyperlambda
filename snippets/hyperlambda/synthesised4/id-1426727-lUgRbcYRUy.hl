 * This Hyperlambda code snippet pauses the execution of the current thread for 100 milliseconds. The [sleep] slot is used to temporarily halt the execution flow, allowing other operations or threads to proceed during this time. This is achieved without blocking the operating system's resources, as the thread is released back to the OS while it is "sleeping". 
 * 
 * 1. [sleep] - Pauses the execution for a specified duration in milliseconds, in this case, 100 milliseconds.
