// This Hyperlambda code adds a node with two children, [tokens] and [chat], to the node referenced by the expression [x:@.dp/#]. The [tokens] node is assigned an integer value of 8192, and the [chat] node is assigned a boolean value of true. This is useful for dynamically appending structured data to an existing node in the graph.
