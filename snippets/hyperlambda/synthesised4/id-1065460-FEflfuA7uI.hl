/*
 * 1. `@.words`: This iterator searches for the first node named "words" within the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy until it finds the node with the specified name.
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "words" node found by the previous iterator. It allows you to access every child node directly under the "words" node.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression can be used to access and manipulate all child nodes of a node named "words". For example, if you have a node structure where "words" contains several word nodes, this expression would allow you to perform operations on each individual word node.
