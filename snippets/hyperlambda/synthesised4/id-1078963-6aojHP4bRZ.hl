/*
 * 1. `@.sitemap` - This iterator starts by locating the first node named "sitemap" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the "." indicates it starts from the current node's context. This is useful when you want to focus on a specific section of your data structure that is labeled with a known name.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "sitemap" node. The asterisk (*) is used to access all direct descendants of a node, which is useful when you want to process or analyze all elements contained within a specific parent node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include generating a list of all URLs or pages defined within a sitemap for a website, or iterating over a collection of items that are organized under a "sitemap" node in a data structure to perform operations like validation or transformation.
