// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to create a new record in a SQLite database table named "comments" using the [data.create] slot. The [database-type] is specified as "sqlite", indicating the type of database being used. The [table] slot specifies the target table for the record insertion. The [values] slot, which is not shown here, would typically contain the fields and corresponding values to be inserted into the "comments" table. This setup is part of a CRUD operation to add new data to the database.
