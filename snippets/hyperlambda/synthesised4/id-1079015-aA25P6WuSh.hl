/*
 * 1. `@.page`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "page" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is located higher up in the node tree, such as retrieving configuration or metadata information stored in a "page" node that applies to the current context. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing page-level metadata or settings in a web application.
 * - Retrieving a common ancestor node that holds shared data for multiple child nodes.
