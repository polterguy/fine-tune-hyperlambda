/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" in the current hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for the node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy. This is useful in scenarios where you need to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot within a Hyperlambda script. It allows you to retrieve and manipulate the arguments provided to a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing and validating input arguments for a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint.
 * - Retrieving argument values to perform operations or calculations based on user input or external data.
