/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet is used to add nodes to a destination node's children collection. 
 * // It uses the [add] slot to append nodes to the [.remaining] node. 
 * // The [get-nodes] slot retrieves nodes from the current node being iterated in a [for-each] loop, 
 * // which is passed by reference as [.dp]. The [#] iterator de-references the value of [.dp], 
 * // allowing [get-nodes] to retrieve the children of the node currently being iterated. 
 * // This construct is typically used in loops to dynamically build or modify node collections.
 * // 1. [default] - This is the root node of the snippet.
 * // 2. [add] - Appends nodes to the [.remaining] node's children collection.
 * // 3. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the current node being iterated, referenced by [.dp].
 * // 4. [x:@.dp/#] - Expression to de-reference and point to the children of the current node being iterated.
