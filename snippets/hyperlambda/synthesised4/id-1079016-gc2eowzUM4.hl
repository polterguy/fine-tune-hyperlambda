// 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" that is found by traversing upwards in the hierarchy from the current node. It looks for a node named "session" among the current node's ancestors and their siblings. This is useful for accessing session-related data or configurations that are stored higher up in the node hierarchy, such as user session information or application state that needs to be accessed from various parts of the application.
