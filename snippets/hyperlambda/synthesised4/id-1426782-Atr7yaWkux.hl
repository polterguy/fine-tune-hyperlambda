// This Hyperlambda code checks if the node referenced by [.dp/#/*/short_description] is not null and its value is not equal to an empty string. If both conditions are true, the [and] slot will evaluate to true. The code uses [not-null] to ensure the presence of a value and [neq] to verify that the value is not an empty string.
