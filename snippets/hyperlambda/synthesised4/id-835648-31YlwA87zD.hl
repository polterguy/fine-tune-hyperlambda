// The Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using the [data.read] slot, specifying a SQLite database type. It selects columns from the "Shippers" table, applying an aggregate function with an alias "result" and includes a [where] clause with an [and] condition. The query groups the results by "group_column". The slots used are: [data.read] for reading data, [database-type] to specify the database, [table] to indicate the table name, [columns] to define selected columns, [aggregate_functor] for aggregation, [as] for aliasing, [where] for conditions, [and] for logical conjunction, and [group] for grouping results.
