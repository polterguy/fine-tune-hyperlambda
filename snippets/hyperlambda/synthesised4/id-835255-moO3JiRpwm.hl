/*
 * The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.create] slot to insert a new record into the "ml_training_snippets" table. It specifies the table name and provides a [values] node with child nodes representing the fields to be inserted. Each field uses an expression to retrieve its value dynamically, except for the [meta] field, which has a static value. This approach ensures that the data is dynamically populated and inserted into the database.
 * 
 * 1. [data.create] - Initiates the creation of a new record in the specified table.
 * 2. [table] - Specifies the name of the table where the record will be inserted.
 * 3. [values] - Contains the fields and their corresponding values to be inserted into the table.
 * 4. [type] - Retrieves the value for the "type" field dynamically using an expression.
 * 5. [uri] - Retrieves the value for the "uri" field dynamically using an expression.
 * 6. [prompt] - Retrieves the value for the "prompt" field dynamically using an expression.
 * 7. [completion] - Retrieves the value for the "completion" field dynamically using an expression.
 * 8. [meta] - Sets a static value "imported" for the "meta" field.
