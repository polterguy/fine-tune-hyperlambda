// This Hyperlambda code checks if the result of retrieving a cache item using the [cache.get] slot is not null. If the cache item exists and has a value, the [not-null] slot will evaluate to true. If the cache item does not exist or has a null value, it will evaluate to false. This is useful for conditionally executing logic based on the presence of a cached item.
