// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.type] node by concatenating a string that combines the primary key type and length from the [.arguments] node, with additional static text to form a SQL primary key declaration. It uses [strings.concat] to join the primary key type and length with parentheses and appends "not null primary key" to the resulting string. The slots used are: [set-value], [strings.concat], and [get-value].
set-value:x:@.type
   strings.concat
      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/pkType
      .:(
      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/pkLength
