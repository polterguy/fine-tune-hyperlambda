/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [arguments] within the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot, as [arguments] nodes typically contain the input parameters for a Hyperlambda execution context.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [arguments] node. It is used to access each individual argument passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `tableName` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named [tableName] from the previously retrieved children nodes of [arguments]. This is typically used to access a specific argument named [tableName] within the [arguments] node, which might represent the name of a database table or similar entity in the context of the Hyperlambda execution.
