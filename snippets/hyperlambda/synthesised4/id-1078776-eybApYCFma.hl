/*
 * This expression is a Hyperlambda expression that retrieves a node by its name. Let's break it down:
 * 
 * 1. `@` - This is the "name" iterator. It retrieves the first node in the current context that matches the specified name. In this case, it looks for a node named `crypto.get-key`.
 * 
 * The expression `@crypto.get-key` is used to access the first node named `crypto.get-key` within the current execution context. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to retrieve a cryptographic key from a previously defined node named `crypto.get-key`.
 * - It might be used in a larger Hyperlambda script that involves encryption or decryption processes, where accessing the cryptographic key is necessary for the operation.
