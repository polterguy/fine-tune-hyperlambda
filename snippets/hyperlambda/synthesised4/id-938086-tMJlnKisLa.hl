// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the node named [.len] using the [get-value] slot. The [get-value] slot takes an expression pointing to the node whose value you want to retrieve. In this case, the expression uses the "@" iterator to locate the [.len] node, and the [get-value] slot returns its value.
