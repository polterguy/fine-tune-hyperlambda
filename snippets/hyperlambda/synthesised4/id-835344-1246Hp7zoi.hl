// This Hyperlambda code deletes records from the "users_roles" table where the user matches the currently authenticated user, and the role is neither "guest" nor "root". The [data.delete] slot specifies the table, and the [where] clause contains conditions using [and] to combine multiple checks: [user.eq] ensures the user matches the authenticated user, while [role.neq] ensures the role is not "guest" or "root".
