/*
 * 1. `@.handle` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "handle" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches upwards and among siblings to find the first occurrence of a node named "handle". This can be useful in scenarios where you need to access a specific node that has been defined earlier in the structure, such as retrieving a configuration or a state that has been set previously. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to access a handle or identifier that was set earlier in the code, allowing subsequent operations to reference or manipulate the same entity or resource.
