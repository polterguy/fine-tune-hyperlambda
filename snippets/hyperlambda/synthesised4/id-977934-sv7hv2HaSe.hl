// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specified node set. It retrieves the name of a node using [get-name] and assigns it as the label, while the value of the node is obtained using [@.dp/#] and assigned as the value. The [add] slot is used to dynamically build a structure by adding nodes with specific labels and values.
