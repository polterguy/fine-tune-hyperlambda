/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve the type of a node's value. It creates a node named [foo] with an integer value of 57, and then uses the [type] slot to obtain the type of the node's value. The [type] slot is invoked with an expression pointing to the previous node, and it returns the type name of the node's value, which in this case is "int". The result of the [type] invocation is the type name of the value of the node it points to.
 * 
 * 1. [foo] - Declares a node with an integer value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type name of the value of the node it points to.
