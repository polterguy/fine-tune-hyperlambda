// This Hyperlambda code uses the [not] slot to logically invert the condition that checks if the HTTP POST response status code is between 200 and 299. The [and] slot combines two conditions: [mte] checks if the status code is more than or equal to 200, and [lt] checks if it is less than 300. If both conditions are true, the [not] slot will invert the result, effectively returning true if the status code is not within the range of 200 to 299, indicating an unsuccessful HTTP request.
