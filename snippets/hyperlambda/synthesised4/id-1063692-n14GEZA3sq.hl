// 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name that appears before it in the hierarchy. In this context, it looks for the first node named "arguments" that is an ancestor or a sibling of the current node. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is not a direct parent or child, but is located somewhere earlier in the hierarchy.
