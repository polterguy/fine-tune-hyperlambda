// Executes a Hyperlambda file specified by the concatenated string path, allowing dynamic file path generation through string concatenation. The [io.file.execute] slot runs the file as if it were a dynamic slot, using the concatenated path as the file location. [strings.concat] is used to build the file path dynamically before execution.
