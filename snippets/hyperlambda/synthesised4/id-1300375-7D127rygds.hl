// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using the [data.read] slot, tailored for a SQLite database. The query targets the "Customers" table and specifies a column operation named [aggregate_functor], which is aliased as "result". This implies an aggregate function, such as COUNT or SUM, is being used to compute a summary value over the specified column(s). The [where] clause contains an [and] node, indicating that multiple conditions can be applied to filter the results, although the specific conditions are not detailed in the snippet. The [group] node, containing [group_column], suggests that the results will be grouped by this column, allowing for aggregate calculations over each group. Finally, the [return-nodes] slot is used to return all nodes resulting from the [data.read] operation, effectively capturing the query's output for further processing or display. This setup is useful for generating summarized reports or statistics from a database table, leveraging grouping and aggregation capabilities.
