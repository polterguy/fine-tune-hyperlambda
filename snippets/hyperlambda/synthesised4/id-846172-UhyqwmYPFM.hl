// This Hyperlambda code uses the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions. The first condition checks if the lowercase version of a string is equal to "integer" using the [eq] and [strings.to-lower] slots. The second condition verifies if the value of a specific node, accessed through a lambda expression, is equal to the integer 1. Both conditions must be true for the [and] slot to evaluate to true.
