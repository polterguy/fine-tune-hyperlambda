/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if a node named [.onafter] exists within the [.arguments] node. If it does, it evaluates the [.onafter] node as a lambda object. The [if] slot is used to conditionally execute the [eval] slot, which processes the [.onafter] node's children if the condition is met. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if the [.onafter] node exists within [.arguments].
 * 2. [exists] - Evaluates to true if the [.onafter] node is present.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 4. [eval] - Executes the children of the [.onafter] node as a lambda object.
