// This Hyperlambda code snippet connects to the "appdb" database and reads data from the "users" table. It applies a filter to select records where the "id" field is equal to 1. The [data.connect] slot establishes the database connection, while the [data.read] slot specifies the table and the condition for filtering records. The [where] clause uses an [and] condition to ensure the "id" equals 1, with [id.eq] performing the equality check.
data.connect:appdb
   data.read
      table:users
      where
         and
            id.eq:int:1
