/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [remove-nodes] slot to delete specific nodes within a Hyperlambda graph. It targets and removes all [.callback] nodes that are children of any [invoke] nodes, which are themselves children of any node in the current context. This operation effectively cleans up or prunes the graph by eliminating unnecessary or unwanted callback nodes under invoke nodes.
 * 
 * 1. [remove-nodes] - Removes all [.callback] nodes under [invoke] nodes in the current context.
