// This Hyperlambda code checks if the result of the [cache.get] slot is not null. If the cache contains an item with the specified key, [not-null] will evaluate to true, indicating that the cache retrieval was successful and the item exists. If the cache does not contain the item, [not-null] will evaluate to false. The code is useful for verifying the existence of a cached item before proceeding with further operations.
