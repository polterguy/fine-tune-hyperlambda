/*
 * 1. `@.fixed`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "fixed" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It will not search among siblings or descendants. This is useful when you need to find a specific configuration or constant value that is defined in a parent node, ensuring that the search is limited to the hierarchy above the current context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a configuration value or constant that is defined at a higher level in the hierarchy, such as a global setting or a fixed parameter that applies to multiple nodes.
 * - Accessing a parent node's attribute that should not be overridden by sibling nodes, ensuring consistency in the use of certain values throughout a section of the Hyperlambda graph.
