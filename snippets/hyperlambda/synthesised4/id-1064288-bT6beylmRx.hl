 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [arguments] in the current context. It is used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot, which are typically organized under an [arguments] node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [arguments] node. It is used to access each individual argument node that is a direct child of the [arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `aggregate_column` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [aggregate_column]. It is used to specifically target and retrieve the [aggregate_column] node from the list of argument nodes.
