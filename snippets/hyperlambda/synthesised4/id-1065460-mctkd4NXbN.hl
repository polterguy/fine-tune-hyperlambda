 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` within the current context. It is used to locate a specific node that is expected to contain arguments for further processing.
 *    
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access the individual argument nodes that are children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `query` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `query`. It is used to specifically target the `query` node among the children of the `.arguments` node, assuming such a node exists.
