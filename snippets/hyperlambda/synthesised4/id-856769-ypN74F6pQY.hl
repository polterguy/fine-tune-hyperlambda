// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] to a specified location within a data structure. It first retrieves nodes using [get-nodes] from the [data.select] node, and then appends these nodes to the path specified by the expression in [add], which is within the [data.connect] node structure. This operation effectively transfers or duplicates nodes from one part of the data structure to another.
