// This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database named "messaging_db" and retrieves the latest 100 records from the "chat_logs" table, ordered by the "timestamp" column in descending order. The results of the SQL query are then added to a node named [result] using the [add] slot, which aggregates the retrieved records.
