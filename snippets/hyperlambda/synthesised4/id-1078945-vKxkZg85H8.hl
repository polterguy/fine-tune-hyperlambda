/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (the next node below in the Hyperlambda hierarchy) of the node that was previously selected. It is useful when you want to move to the next node at the same level in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is useful for accessing all immediate descendants of a node.
 * 
 * 3. `/*` - This second `/*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes selected by the previous `/*`. It allows for deeper traversal into the hierarchy, accessing grandchildren nodes.
 * 
 * 4. `/*` - This third `/*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes selected by the previous `/*`. It allows for even deeper traversal, accessing great-grandchildren nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `/content` - This iterator filters the current node set to only include nodes with the name "content". It is useful for selecting specific nodes based on their name.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to navigate a complex hierarchical data structure where you need to find the "content" node that is a great-grandchild of the elder sibling of the current node. This might be useful in scenarios where you have a structured document or configuration file and need to extract or manipulate specific data nested deep within the structure.
