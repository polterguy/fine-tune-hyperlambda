/*
 * 1. `@.result` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "result" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches upwards and includes siblings and their children. This is useful for accessing a specific node's children or descendants when you know the node's name but not its exact location relative to the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "result" node. It is used to access all direct children of a node, which is useful when you need to process or evaluate each child node individually.
 * 
 * 3. `references` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved node set to include only nodes with the name "references". It is used to narrow down the node set to specific nodes of interest, allowing you to perform operations or evaluations on these nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing and processing all "references" nodes that are direct children of a "result" node, such as when you need to aggregate or analyze reference data.
 * - Retrieving specific data points within a larger data structure for further computation or transformation.
