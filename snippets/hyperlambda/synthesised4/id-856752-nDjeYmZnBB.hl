// This Hyperlambda code snippet modifies JSON data by replacing occurrences of "},{" with "}\n{" to format the JSON for better readability. The [set-value] slot updates the [.file-data] node with the result of the [strings.replace] operation, which processes the JSON string converted from a lambda object using [lambda2json]. The replacement inserts a newline between JSON objects, enhancing the visual structure of the JSON data.
