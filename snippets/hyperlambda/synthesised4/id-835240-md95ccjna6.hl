// The code snippet uses the [io.stream.read] slot to read data from a stream. The stream is accessed through a lambda expression pointing to the [stream] node within the [file] node, which is a child of the [.arguments] node. This setup is typically used to read data from a stream passed as an argument to a Hyperlambda function or endpoint.
io.stream.read:x:@.arguments/*/file/*/stream
