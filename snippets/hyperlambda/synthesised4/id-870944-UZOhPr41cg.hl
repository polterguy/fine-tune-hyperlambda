/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append a new node structure to a specified location in the node graph. It retrieves the [url] and [title] from a referenced node and adds them as children to a newly created node under [snippets]. The [add] slot targets the [return] node, and the use of expressions allows for dynamic referencing and manipulation of nodes.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends a new node structure to the specified location in the node graph.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the root of the new node structure being added.
 * 3. [.] - Represents the parent node of [url], [title], and [snippets].
 * 4. [url] - Retrieves the URL from a referenced node and adds it as a child.
 * 5. [title] - Retrieves the title from a referenced node and adds it as a child.
 * 6. [snippets] - A new node added as a sibling to [url] and [title].
