// The code uses a [switch] statement to determine the value of the [activity] node based on the value of the [day] node. It checks for specific days of the week, such as "monday", "wednesday", and "friday", and assigns corresponding activities like "Meeting", "Coding", and "Planning". If the [day] node does not match any of the specified cases, the [default] case assigns "Regular work" to the [activity] node.
