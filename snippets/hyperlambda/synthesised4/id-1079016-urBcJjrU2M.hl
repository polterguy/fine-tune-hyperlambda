// 1. `@.fixed` - This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which is used to find the first node with the specified name. In this case, it looks for the first node named `.fixed` within the current context. This is useful when you need to directly access a specific node by its name without traversing through siblings or children. A potential use case for this expression is when you have a configuration or a constant value stored in a node named `.fixed` and you need to retrieve it for further processing or validation.
