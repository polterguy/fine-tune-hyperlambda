// This Hyperlambda code adds a new node structure to the [.summary] node. It creates an [item] node with two children: [label], which gets its value from the name of the current node, and [data], which retrieves the value of the current node being iterated by reference. The [add] slot is used to append this structure to the [.summary] node, effectively summarizing data with labels and corresponding values.
