/*
 * 1. `@.no-invocation`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no-invocation" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It does not traverse child nodes but looks upwards in the hierarchy from the current node. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be defined earlier in the structure or at the same level, ensuring that you are referencing the correct node without going into deeper nested structures.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to check if a specific configuration or flag node named "no-invocation" exists at the current level or higher in the hierarchy, which might control whether certain operations should be executed or skipped.
