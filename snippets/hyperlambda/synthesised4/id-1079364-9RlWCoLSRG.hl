/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name. The `.` indicates that it will start the search from the current node's parent, meaning it will look for a sibling node named "sql". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve a SQL query or command stored in a node named "sql" that is a sibling to the current node. This could be useful in scenarios where you are dynamically constructing or executing SQL commands within a Hyperlambda script.
