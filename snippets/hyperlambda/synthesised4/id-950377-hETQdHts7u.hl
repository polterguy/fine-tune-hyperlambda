// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates a conditional structure using the [if] slot combined with the [and] slot. It checks if two conditions are true: the first condition compares the result of [SOME_EXPRESSION] with [SOME_VALUE], and the second condition compares the result of [SOME_OTHER_EXPRESSION] with [SOME_OTHER_VALUE]. If both conditions are true, the code within the [.lambda] block will be executed. This structure is useful for executing code only when multiple conditions are met simultaneously.
