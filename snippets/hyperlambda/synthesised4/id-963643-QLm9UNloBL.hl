// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes to a specified destination. It targets nodes within the [return-nodes] path and adds structured data elements such as [title], [link], [snippet], [thumbnail], [date], and [source] to each node. The [add] slot takes a destination expression and appends the specified child nodes, which are derived from the current node's data path using lambda expressions.
