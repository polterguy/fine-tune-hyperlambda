/*
 * This Hyperlambda code iterates over each file in a specified directory and deletes each file except for one specific file. It uses a [for-each] loop to iterate through the files, an [if] statement to check if the current file is not the specified file, and [io.file.delete] to delete the file if the condition is met. 
 * 
 * 1. [for-each] - Iterates over each file in the directory specified by [io.file.list].
 * 2. [if] - Checks if the current file is not the specified file.
 * 3. [neq] - Compares the current file's path to the specified file path.
 * 4. [io.file.delete] - Deletes the current file if it is not the specified file.
