// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced, effectively "unwrapping" the value. In this example, the expression `x:+/*/*/*` is evaluated, and the result is assigned to the node where [unwrap] is invoked. This allows for dynamic evaluation and assignment of values within the Hyperlambda graph.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*
