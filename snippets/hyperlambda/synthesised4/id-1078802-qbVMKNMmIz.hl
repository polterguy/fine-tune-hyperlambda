/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named `hyper2lambda` in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy to find the first matching node. This is useful when you want to reference a specific node by name, regardless of its position relative to the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the `hyper2lambda` node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the node, which can be useful for iterating over or processing all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `.lambda` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to only include those named `.lambda`. It is used to narrow down the node set to only those nodes that are specifically named `.lambda`, which might represent a specific type of data or functionality within the context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to locate and process all `.lambda` nodes that are children of a `hyper2lambda` node. This might be useful in a scenario where `.lambda` nodes represent specific executable code blocks or configurations that need to be executed or analyzed.
 * - Another use case could be in a system where `hyper2lambda` nodes represent modules or components, and `.lambda` nodes within them represent specific functions or operations that need to be invoked or validated.
