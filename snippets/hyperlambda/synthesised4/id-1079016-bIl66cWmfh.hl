/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "session" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings but looks for a node with the specified name among its direct ancestors. This is useful when you need to access session-related data or settings that are defined higher up in the node hierarchy, such as user session information or configuration settings that are shared across multiple parts of the Hyperlambda code. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing user session data to check authentication or authorization status.
 * - Retrieving configuration settings that are stored in a session node to apply them in different parts of the application.
