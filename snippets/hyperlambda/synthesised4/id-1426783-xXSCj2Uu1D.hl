// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and replace the value of a node with the result of a lambda expression that traverses the node hierarchy. The expression "+/*/*" is used to navigate through the node structure, and the [unwrap] slot ensures that this expression is evaluated before the node is processed, effectively "unwrapping" the node's value based on the specified path.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
