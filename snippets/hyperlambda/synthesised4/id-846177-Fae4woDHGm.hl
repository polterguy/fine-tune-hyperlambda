/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement with [case] slots to handle different conditions based on the value of a [mediumblob] node. The [switch] slot evaluates the value of the [mediumblob] node and executes the corresponding [case] block if a match is found. If no match is found, the [default] block is executed. This structure allows for conditional branching based on the value of a specific node.
 * 
 * 1. [mediumblob] - The node whose value is evaluated by the [switch] statement.
 * 2. [switch] - Initiates the conditional branching based on the value of [mediumblob].
 * 3. [case] - Represents a specific condition to match against the value of [mediumblob].
 * 4. [default] - Executes if no [case] matches the value of [mediumblob].
