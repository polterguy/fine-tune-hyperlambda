// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied to the current node's elder sibling, as indicated by the "+" iterator. The "/*" part suggests that all children of the elder sibling will be evaluated. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions inside a lambda object before it is executed.
