/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate upwards in the hierarchy to access the parent node of the node from which the expression is being evaluated.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it will retrieve all children of the parent node identified by the previous `.` iterator.
 * 
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "signal". It will select nodes named "signal" from the children of the parent node.
 * 
 * 4. `[1,2]` - This iterator retrieves a subset of the previous result set. Specifically, it retrieves the second and third nodes (since indexing starts at 0) from the nodes named "signal". This is useful for selecting specific nodes when there are multiple nodes with the same name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to access specific "signal" nodes within a parent node, perhaps to process or evaluate them in a sequence where only the second and third "signal" nodes are relevant.
 * - It might be used in a scenario where a parent node contains multiple "signal" nodes, and only a specific subset (the second and third) needs to be manipulated or checked for certain conditions.
