/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. It is often used to access the arguments section of a Hyperlambda graph, which typically contains input parameters for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each individual argument passed into the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `max_tokens` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [max_tokens]. It is used to specifically access the value of the [max_tokens] argument, which might be used to specify a limit on the number of tokens or iterations in a process.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function to dynamically adjust the number of tokens processed based on user input or configuration settings.
 * - It might be used in a context where the number of tokens needs to be limited, such as in a natural language processing task or API call that requires a token limit for performance or cost reasons.
