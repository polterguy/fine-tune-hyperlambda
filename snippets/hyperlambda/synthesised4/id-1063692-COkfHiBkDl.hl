/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current node's hierarchy, starting from the current node and moving upwards. It's commonly used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any node that is a direct child of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `username` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "username" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target the "username" argument passed to a function or slot.
