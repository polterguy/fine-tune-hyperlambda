// The code snippet uses the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions: it checks if the string in [.result] contains the substring "FUNCTION_INVOCATION[" using [strings.contains], and it verifies that [.has-sent-waiting] is not equal to true using [neq]. The [and] slot will only evaluate to true if both conditions are satisfied.
