/*
 * This expression is a Hyperlambda expression used to retrieve a node with a specific name. Let's break down the expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@config.get`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "config.get" from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that the expression is looking for a node by name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to access configuration settings within a Hyperlambda application. By retrieving the "config.get" node, the application can obtain specific configuration values needed for its operation.
 * - It might be used in a scenario where dynamic configuration retrieval is necessary, allowing the application to adapt to different environments or settings without hardcoding values.
