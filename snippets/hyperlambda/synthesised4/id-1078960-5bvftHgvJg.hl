/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "signal" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy until it finds a node named "signal". This is useful for locating specific nodes in a complex structure where the node might not be a direct child or sibling.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator. In this context, it will get all child nodes of the "signal" node. This is useful when you need to process or evaluate all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `crawl-delay` - This iterator filters the result set from the previous iterator to only include nodes named "crawl-delay". It is used to find specific nodes among the children of the "signal" node that have the name "crawl-delay".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a web crawler configuration to retrieve the "crawl-delay" settings from a "signal" node, allowing the crawler to adjust its delay between requests accordingly.
 * - It could also be used in a monitoring system to check for specific delay configurations within a set of signals, ensuring that operations adhere to defined timing constraints.
