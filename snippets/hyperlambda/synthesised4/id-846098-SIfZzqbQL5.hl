// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of the string value obtained from the node [[chat]] within the node referenced by [.result] with the string "false". The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the target substring to be replaced, and the second is the replacement string.
strings.replace:x:@.result
   .:[[chat]]
