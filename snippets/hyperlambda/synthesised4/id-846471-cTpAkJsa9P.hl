// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Employees" and "ReportsTo". The join condition is specified such that the "ReportsTo" alias is used for the "Employees" table, and the join is based on matching the "ReportsTo" column from the "Employees" table with the "EmployeeID" column from the "ReportsTo" alias. The use of the "as" keyword allows for aliasing the "Employees" table as "ReportsTo" in the join operation.
