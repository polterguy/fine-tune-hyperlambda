/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to navigate to the top of the node hierarchy from the current position.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it is used to get all the children of the root node.
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "signal". It is used to find specific nodes named "signal" among the children of the root node.
 * 
 * This expression is used to navigate from the current node to the root of the Hyperlambda structure, retrieve all its children, and then filter out those children to find nodes specifically named "signal". This can be useful in scenarios where you need to process or evaluate nodes with a specific name at the root level of your Hyperlambda document.
