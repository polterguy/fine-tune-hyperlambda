// The code uses the [strings.regex-replace] slot to remove a specific pattern from the value of a node. It targets the [data_type] node within the current [.dp] node's children, replacing any occurrence of the pattern " ([0-9,]+)" with an empty string. This effectively removes any numeric sequences enclosed in parentheses from the node's value.
