/*
 * The code snippet takes the JSON output from a [lambda2json] operation and replaces occurrences of "},{" with "}\n{", effectively adding a newline between JSON objects. This is done using the [strings.replace] slot, and the result is stored in the [.file-data] node using the [set-value] slot. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.file-data] node.
 * 2. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of "},{" with "}\n{" in the JSON string.
 * 3. [lambda2json] - Provides the JSON string to be manipulated.
