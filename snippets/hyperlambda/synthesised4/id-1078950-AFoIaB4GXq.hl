/*
 * 1. `@.embeddings-model`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "embeddings-model" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, to find the specified node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access configuration or settings related to an "embeddings-model" that might be defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure. 
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to fetch and utilize parameters or values associated with an embeddings model for further processing or decision-making within the same Hyperlambda execution context.
