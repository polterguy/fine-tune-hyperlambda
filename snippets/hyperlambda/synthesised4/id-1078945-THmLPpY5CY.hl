/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It searches for the node named "arguments" that is closest to the current node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access the immediate children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `user_id` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "user_id". It selects the node named "user_id" from the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * **Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used to extract the "user_id" from a set of arguments passed to a function or an endpoint. It is useful in scenarios where you need to validate or process the user ID provided in the input arguments.
 * - It can also be used in logging or debugging to retrieve and log the user ID from a request or operation context.
