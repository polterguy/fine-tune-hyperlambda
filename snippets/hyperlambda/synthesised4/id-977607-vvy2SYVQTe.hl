// The code snippet demonstrates how to add a time span to a current date and time value. It uses the [math.add] slot to add a time span of 2 hours and 30 minutes, created by the [time] slot, to the value retrieved from the [.now] node using [get-value]. This operation effectively calculates a future date and time by adding the specified duration to the current time.
