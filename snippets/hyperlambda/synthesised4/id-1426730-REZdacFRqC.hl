// This Hyperlambda code retrieves all child nodes of the [headers] node within the [.arguments] node. It uses the [get-nodes] slot to access these nodes, allowing further manipulation or inspection of the headers in the context of an HTTP request or similar operation. The expression `@.arguments/*/headers` specifies the path to the [headers] node, and the [get-nodes] slot returns all its children.
