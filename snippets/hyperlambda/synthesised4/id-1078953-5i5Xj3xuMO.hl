/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by selecting the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` implies it will look in the current context or hierarchy level.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It essentially expands the selection to include every child node under `.arguments`.
 * 
 * 3. `.onafter`: This iterator filters the previously selected nodes to find the first node named `.onafter`. The `.` indicates that it is looking for a node at the current level within the children of `.arguments`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda script to access a specific configuration or setting defined under an `.onafter` node within the `.arguments` section. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to execute or evaluate code based on post-processing conditions or actions defined in a Hyperlambda HTTP endpoint or slot.
