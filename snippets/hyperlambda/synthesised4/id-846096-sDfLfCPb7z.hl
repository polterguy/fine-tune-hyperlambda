// The [type] slot in Hyperlambda returns the type name of a given value. In the provided example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer type and a value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to retrieve the type of the [.foo] node, which will result in the type name being returned. This is useful for dynamically determining the type of a node's value in Hyperlambda scripts.
