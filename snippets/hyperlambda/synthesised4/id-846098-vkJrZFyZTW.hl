// This Hyperlambda code snippet replaces all carriage return characters in the value of the [.greeting] node with the escaped string "\\r". It uses the [strings.replace] slot to perform the replacement and the [set-value] slot to update the [.greeting] node with the modified string. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the string to be replaced, and the second is the replacement string. The [set-value] slot then assigns the result back to the [.greeting] node.
set-value:x:@.greeting
   strings.replace:x:@.greeting
      .:"\r"
      .:"\\r"
