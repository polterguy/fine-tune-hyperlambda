/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is useful for accessing the arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which typically contains input parameters or configuration data for the current execution context.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access all the parameters or configuration items defined within the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `prefix` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `prefix`. It is used to specifically target and retrieve the value of the `prefix` node within the `.arguments` node, which might be used to modify or configure subsequent operations based on this prefix value.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where a function or endpoint needs to retrieve a specific configuration or input parameter named `prefix` from its arguments, possibly to prepend this prefix to other data or to use it as a configuration setting for further processing.
