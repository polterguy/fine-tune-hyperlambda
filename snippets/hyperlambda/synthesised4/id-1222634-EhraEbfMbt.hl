// Retrieves the younger sibling of the node that is currently being processed. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the node that is immediately below the current node in the hierarchy. For example, if you are iterating over a list of nodes and need to compare or update the value of the next node in sequence, this expression can be used to access it directly.
