// The Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to retrieve the type of a node's value using the [type] slot. The example sets a node [.foo] with an integer type and value of 57, and then uses [type] to obtain the type name of the node's value. This is useful for dynamically determining the data type of a node's value within a Hyperlambda script.
