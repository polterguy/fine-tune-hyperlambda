// 1. `@.sql` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name. This is useful for retrieving specific nodes when you know the exact name of the node you are interested in. In this case, it retrieves the node named "sql" that is a direct child of the current node.
