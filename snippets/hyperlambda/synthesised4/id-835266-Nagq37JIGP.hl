 * The code snippet uses the [get-count] slot to determine the number of child nodes under the [snippets] node within the [signal] node's hierarchy. This operation is useful for counting specific elements in a structured data set, allowing for efficient data management and analysis. 
 * 
 * 1. [get-count] - Retrieves the count of nodes specified by the expression, in this case, counting the children of [snippets] within [signal].
