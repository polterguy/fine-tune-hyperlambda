// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to append new nodes to the node referenced by [.dp]. It adds two child nodes: [tokens] with an integer value of 4096 and [chat] with a boolean value of true. This operation dynamically modifies the structure of the graph by adding these nodes to the specified destination node.
