/*
 * This Hyperlambda code calculates the maximum context and request tokens for a model by first subtracting a static integer from the model's maximum tokens and then dividing the result by 2. The calculated value is then set as both the maximum context tokens and maximum request tokens for the model. The code uses [math.subtract] to perform the subtraction and [math.divide] for the division, followed by [set-value] to assign the results to the respective nodes. 
 * 
 * 1. [math.subtract] - Subtracts 2 from the model's maximum tokens.
 * 2. [math.divide] - Divides the result of the subtraction by 2.
 * 3. [set-value] - Sets the calculated value as the maximum context tokens.
 * 4. [set-value] - Sets the calculated value as the maximum request tokens.
