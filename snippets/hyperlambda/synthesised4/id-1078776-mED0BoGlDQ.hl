/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node, which means it selects the node immediately following the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. It's useful for accessing nodes that are sequentially below the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node. After selecting the elder sibling with `+`, `*` will get all its children nodes. This is useful for processing or evaluating all child nodes under a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved node set to include only nodes named "signal". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes with a specific name, which is helpful when you are interested in nodes with a particular identifier.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This final iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes named "signal". It allows you to access the entire subtree under each "signal" node, which can be useful for further processing or evaluation of these nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to process or evaluate all nodes under a "signal" node that is a child of the elder sibling of the current node. This might be relevant in a system where "signal" nodes represent specific events or triggers that need to be handled or logged.
