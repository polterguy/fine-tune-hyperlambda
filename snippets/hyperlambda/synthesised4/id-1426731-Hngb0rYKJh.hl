/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node. It retrieves the value of the node referenced by [.dp/#] and assigns it to the node referenced by [.url]. This is useful for dynamically updating node values based on other nodes' values.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node referenced by its expression [.dp/#].
