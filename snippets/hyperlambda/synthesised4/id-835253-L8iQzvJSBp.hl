// This Hyperlambda code snippet performs a database query to select specific fields from the "ml_training_snippets" table where certain conditions are met. It uses [add] to store the result, [data.select] to execute the SQL query, and filters records based on the "type" and "id" parameters, ordering by "id" and limiting the results to 20. The parameters are dynamically sourced from the [.arguments] node.
add:x:@.data
   data.select:"\nselect id, prompt, completion\n   from ml_training_snippets\n   where type = @type and id > @id and embedding is null order by id limit 20"
      type:x:@.arguments/*/type
      id:x:@.id
