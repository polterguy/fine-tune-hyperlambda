// This Hyperlambda code snippet saves the value "valid" to the cache using a dynamically generated key created by concatenating multiple strings. The cache entry is set to expire after 30 seconds. The key is generated by the [strings.concat] slot, which combines a series of strings to form a unique cache key. The [expiration] slot specifies the duration the cache entry should remain valid.
cache.set:x:@strings.concat
   expiration:long:30
   value:valid
