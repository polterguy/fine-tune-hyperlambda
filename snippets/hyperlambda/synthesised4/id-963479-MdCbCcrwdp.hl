// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [data.read] slot to query an "orders" table for records where the "status" is "pending" and the "amount" is 100. The [limit] is set to -1, which means no limit is applied to the number of records returned. The [where] clause specifies the conditions for filtering the records, using [and] to combine the conditions [status.eq] and [amount.eq].
