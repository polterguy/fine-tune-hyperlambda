/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the value of a specific node within a data structure. It uses the [set-value] slot to update the "as" node under the second column in a SQL query's columns list, which is part of a data read operation. The new value is retrieved using [get-value] from an argument named "aggregate_function". The code is useful for dynamically setting alias names for columns in SQL queries based on input arguments. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the specified node.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value from the specified argument node.
