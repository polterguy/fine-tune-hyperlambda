/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator searches for the first node with the specified name in the current context. In this case, it looks for the first node named "already-exists" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors.
 * 2. `.already-exists` - This specifies the name of the node the `@` iterator is searching for. It indicates that the expression is looking for a node named "already-exists".
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to check if a node named "already-exists" is present in the current context, which might be useful for validation or conditional logic to avoid duplicating nodes or processing nodes that have already been handled.
