// The [case] slot is used within a [switch] block to define specific conditions that, when matched, execute the associated lambda object. Each [case] node must have a value, which is compared against the evaluated value of the [switch] node. If a match is found, the corresponding [case] block is executed. If no [case] matches, an optional [default] block can be executed.
