// The Hyperlambda code sets an HTTP response header for cache control. By using the [response.headers.set] slot, it specifies that the response should be cached publicly for a maximum of 300 seconds. This ensures that the client and any intermediate caches store the response for the specified duration, optimizing performance by reducing server load and latency for repeated requests. The [Cache-Control] header is crucial for managing how and for how long responses are cached.
