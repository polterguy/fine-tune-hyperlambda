// This Hyperlambda code uses an [if] statement to compare a converted integer value from [data.scalar] with the value of [.no] using the [mt] slot. If the converted value is greater, it sets the [.block] node's value to true. The [convert] slot is used to ensure the value from [data.scalar] is treated as an integer for the comparison.
