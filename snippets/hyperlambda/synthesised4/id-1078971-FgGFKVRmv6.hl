// 1. `@.password`: This iterator searches for the first node named "password" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "password" node it encounters. This is useful for retrieving sensitive information like passwords that might be stored in a specific node within a larger structure. A potential use case could be accessing a user's password node to validate credentials during an authentication process.
