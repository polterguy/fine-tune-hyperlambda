 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context with the specified name that follows the `@` character. In this case, it looks for a node named "fields" in the current context or hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access a specific node by its name within the current execution context.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve a node named "fields" from the current context, which might be useful in scenarios where you need to access or manipulate data stored under a node with this specific name, such as when processing form fields or data structures in a Hyperlambda script.
