/*
 * 1. `@.only-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "only-prompt" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. This is useful when you want to find a specific ancestor node by name, ensuring that you are referencing the correct hierarchical context in your Hyperlambda code. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access a configuration or setting defined in a parent node named "only-prompt", ensuring that the operation or logic applies to the correct context within a larger Hyperlambda structure.
