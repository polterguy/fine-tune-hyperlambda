/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing the arguments passed to a function or a slot, typically found at the top of the current execution context.
 *    
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are directly under the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `data` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "data". It is used to specifically target the "data" argument within the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to access a specific argument named "data" that was passed to it. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to process or validate the "data" argument within a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint.
