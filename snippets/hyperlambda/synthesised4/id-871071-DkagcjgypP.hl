// This Hyperlambda code snippet loads a file named "system-message-synthesiser.md" from the specified directory and processes its content. The [io.file.load] slot is used to read the file, and the content is then available for further manipulation or execution within the Hyperlambda environment. This allows for dynamic loading and execution of external resources, facilitating modular and flexible code management.
