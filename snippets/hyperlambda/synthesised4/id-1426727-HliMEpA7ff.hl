/*
 * This code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot in Hyperlambda to determine the type of a node's value. The [type] slot is used to retrieve the Hyperlambda type name of a specified value. In this example, a node named [.foo] is declared with an integer value of 57. The [type] slot is then invoked with an expression pointing to the node to retrieve its type. After execution, the value of the [type] slot will be "int", indicating that the value of the [.foo] node is of integer type.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type of the node's value.
