/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [switch] slot to execute conditional logic based on the value of a node. The [switch] slot evaluates the value of [.val] and executes the first matching [case] node. If no [case] matches, the [default] node is executed. The code sets the [.result] node's value based on the evaluated case or default condition. 
 * 
 * 1. [.val] - Holds the value to be evaluated in the switch statement.
 * 2. [.result] - Node where the result of the switch case execution is stored.
 * 3. [switch] - Evaluates the value of [.val] and determines which [case] or [default] to execute.
 * 4. [case] - Executes its child nodes if its value matches the evaluated value of the [switch].
 * 5. [default] - Executes if no [case] value matches the evaluated value of the [switch].
