// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [mt] slot to compare two values. It checks if the value of the node pointed to by the expression `@.no-invocation` is greater than 0. If the condition is true, the [mt] slot returns true; otherwise, it returns false. The [mt] slot is used for "more than" comparisons between two arguments.
