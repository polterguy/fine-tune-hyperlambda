/*
 * 1. `@signal`: This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy until it finds a node with this name. This is useful when you need to locate a specific node within a complex structure, especially when the node's position is not fixed.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the previously found "signal" node. It is used to access the immediate descendants of a node, which is helpful when you want to perform operations or checks on all child nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `has-sitemap`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "has-sitemap" among the children of the "signal" node. This is useful for scenarios where you need to verify the existence of a specific configuration or property within a set of nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Checking if a "signal" node contains a child node named "has-sitemap" to determine if a sitemap feature is enabled or configured.
 * - Validating the structure of a configuration file or data object to ensure it includes necessary components.
