// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the value of all nodes referenced by the expression [@.arg/*/schema/*/type] to the static string "integer". The [set-value] slot is used to modify the value of nodes, and the expression specifies the path to the nodes whose values are to be changed. The operation is performed in place, updating the nodes directly.
