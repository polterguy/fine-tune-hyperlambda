/*
 * 1. `@.scheme`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "scheme" that is either a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It does not traverse the node's children. This is useful when you need to access configuration or settings that are defined at a higher level in the hierarchy or alongside the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a configuration setting like a URL scheme (e.g., "http" or "https") that is defined at a higher level in a configuration file.
 * - Accessing a protocol or scheme setting that is shared among several nodes in a configuration or data structure.
