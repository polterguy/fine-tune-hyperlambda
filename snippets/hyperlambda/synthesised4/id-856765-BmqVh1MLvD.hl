// The code demonstrates how to use various comparison slots in Hyperlambda for conditional logic. It includes examples of [lte], [lt], [mt], and [mte] slots, each performing specific comparisons between integer values. The [lte] slot checks if a value is less than or equal to another, [lt] checks if a value is less than another, [mt] checks if a value is more than another, and [mte] checks if a value is more than or equal to another. Each example retrieves a value using [get-value] and compares it to a static integer value.
