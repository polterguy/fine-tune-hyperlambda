// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [max_request_tokens] node within the [.model] node to the result obtained from a [math.divide] operation. The [set-value] slot is used to assign a new value to the specified node, and the [get-value] slot retrieves the result from the [math.divide] operation to be used as the new value.
