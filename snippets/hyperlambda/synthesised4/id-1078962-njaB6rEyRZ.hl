/*
 * 1. `@html2markdown`: This iterator retrieves the first node named `html2markdown` in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further navigation within the node structure. This is useful when you want to begin your search or operation from a specific node named `html2markdown`.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `html2markdown` node. It allows you to access any node directly under `html2markdown`, regardless of their names. This is useful when you want to perform operations on all direct children of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `urls`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `urls` from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to narrow down the search to nodes with a specific name, in this case, `urls`. This is useful when you know the name of the node you are interested in and want to exclude others.
 * 
 * 4. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `urls` node. It allows you to access any node directly under `urls`, regardless of their names. This is useful when you want to perform operations on all direct children of a specific node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to extract or manipulate a list of URLs from a node structure where URLs are organized under a `urls` node, which is a child of a `html2markdown` node. This might be useful in a scenario where you need to convert HTML content to Markdown and need to handle or process URLs separately.
