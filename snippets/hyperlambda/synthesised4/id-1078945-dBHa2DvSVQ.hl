/*
 * 1. `@.session` - This iterator starts by selecting the first node with the name "session" in the current context. It is typically used to locate a specific node that might contain session-related data.
 * 
 * 2. `**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the "session" node, including the node itself. It is useful for searching through the entire hierarchy under the "session" node to find specific data.
 * 
 * 3. `role` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "role". It is used to narrow down the search to nodes that specifically represent roles within the session.
 * 
 * 4. `=developer` - This iterator further filters the nodes to include only those whose value is "developer". It is used to identify nodes that represent a developer role.
 * 
 * 5. `[0,1]` - This iterator selects a subset of the filtered nodes, specifically the first node in the set. It is useful for retrieving a single node when multiple nodes might match the previous criteria.
 * 
 * 6. `.` - This iterator moves up to the parent node of the current node. It is used to access the parent node of the "role" node that was selected.
 * 
 * 7. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the current parent node. It is used to access additional data related to the selected role.
 * 
 * 8. `content` - This iterator filters the children nodes to include only those with the name "content". It is used to extract specific content associated with the developer role.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract content related to a "developer" role from a session object, which might be useful in applications that need to display or process information specific to developers.
 * - It can be applied in scenarios where role-based content needs to be dynamically retrieved and displayed, such as in a role-based access control system.
