/*
 * 1. `@data.read` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "data.read" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for accessing a specific node that might contain data or configuration settings.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected "data.read" node. It is useful when you want to explore or manipulate all the direct children of a particular node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of each node returned by the previous `*` iterator. This effectively allows you to access all grandchildren of the "data.read" node, which can be useful for deep data structures where relevant information is nested within multiple layers.
 * 
 * 4. `max_context_tokens` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "max_context_tokens". It is used to pinpoint specific data within a potentially large and complex node structure, ensuring that only relevant nodes are returned.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * - Retrieving configuration settings related to the maximum context tokens allowed in a system, which could be used in applications that process natural language data.
 * - Accessing specific parameters within a nested data structure for validation or processing purposes.
