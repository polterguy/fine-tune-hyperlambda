// The code demonstrates how to delete records from a "customers" table using the [data.delete] slot. It specifies a [where] clause to ensure only records with a customer_id matching the provided argument are deleted. The [and] condition is used to combine multiple criteria, though only one is present here.
data.delete
   table:customers
