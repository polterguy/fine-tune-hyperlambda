// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.greeting] node to the first non-null value found in the [data.read] node's children under the path [*/greeting]. If no such value is found, it defaults to "Hello there! How may I help you today?". This approach is useful for providing default values when specific data might be missing.
set-value:x:@.greeting

      .:Hello there! How may I help you today?
