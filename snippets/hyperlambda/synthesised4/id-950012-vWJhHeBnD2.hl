// This Hyperlambda code subtracts the integer value 4 from the length of a string. It uses the [math.subtract] slot to perform the subtraction operation, where the first operand is the result of the [strings.length] slot, and the second operand is the static integer value 4. The [strings.length] slot calculates the length of a string, which is then used in the subtraction.
