/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-name] slot to change the names of nodes. It targets all nodes referenced by its expression, which in this case is a relative path, and sets their names to the value obtained from the [get-value] slot. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [group_column] node within the [.arguments] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the name of nodes referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [group_column] node within [.arguments].
