// This code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to assign a value to the [.echo] node. It retrieves the value from the [input] node within the [.arguments] node using the [get-value] slot. This operation effectively echoes the input value to the [.echo] node, demonstrating how to transfer data from one node to another within a Hyperlambda graph.
