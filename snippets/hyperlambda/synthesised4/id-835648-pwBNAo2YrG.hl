/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the name of nodes in a specific path within a data connection structure. It targets nodes under [group] within [data.read] and sets their names to values obtained from the [group_column] argument. The process involves using [set-name] to rename nodes based on values retrieved by [get-value]. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the name of nodes specified by its expression.
 * 2. [@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column] - Expression pointing to the nodes to rename.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value from the specified argument.
 * 4. [@.arguments/*/group_column] - Expression to fetch the new name for the nodes.
