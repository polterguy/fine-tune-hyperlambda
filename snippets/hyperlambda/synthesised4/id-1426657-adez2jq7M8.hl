 * This Hyperlambda code replaces all newline characters ("\n") in the value of the [.anchor] node with spaces (" "). It uses the [strings.replace] slot to perform the replacement and the [set-value] slot to update the [.anchor] node with the modified string. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the [.anchor] node.
 * 2. [strings.replace] - Replaces newline characters with spaces in the [.anchor] node's value.
 * 3. [.] - Specifies the newline character to be replaced.
 * 4. [.] - Specifies the space character to replace newlines with.
