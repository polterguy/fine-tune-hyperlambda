/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda file or slot, which contains the parameters passed to the slot or file.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument node individually, allowing further filtering or processing.
 * 
 * 3. `limit` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `limit`. It is used to specifically target the `limit` argument within the `.arguments` node, which might represent a limit value for operations such as pagination or restricting the number of items processed.
 * 
 * This expression is useful for accessing a specific argument named `limit` from the arguments node in a Hyperlambda context, which can be used to control the number of items to process or return in a given operation.
