 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a Hyperlambda slot or endpoint.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument passed to the slot or endpoint.
 * 3. `/foreignTable` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [foreignTable]. It is used to specifically access the argument named "foreignTable" among the children of the [.arguments] node.
