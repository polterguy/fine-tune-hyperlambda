/*
 * This Hyperlambda code concatenates strings by retrieving values from specific nodes and inserting underscores between them. It first gets the value of the [verb] node under the [.dp] node, then appends an underscore, followed by the first node from the [strings.split] result, another underscore, and finally the second node from the [strings.split] result. This results in a single concatenated string with underscores as separators. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 2. [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/verb] - Retrieves the value of the [verb] node under the [.dp] node.
 * 3. [.] - Inserts an underscore as a separator.
 * 4. [get-value:x:@strings.split/0/-/-] - Retrieves the first node from the [strings.split] result.
 * 5. [.] - Inserts another underscore as a separator.
 * 6. [get-value:x:@strings.split/0/-] - Retrieves the second node from the [strings.split] result.
