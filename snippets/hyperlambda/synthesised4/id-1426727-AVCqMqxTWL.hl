/*
 * The code snippet uses the [eval] slot to execute all children nodes of the [.onafter] node, which is a child of any node under [.arguments]. This allows for dynamic execution of code segments defined within the [.onafter] node, typically used for post-processing or cleanup tasks after the main logic has been executed. 
 * 
 * 1. [eval] - Executes the children nodes of the node specified in its expression.
 * 2. [x:@.arguments/*/.onafter] - Lambda expression pointing to the [.onafter] node under any child of [.arguments].
