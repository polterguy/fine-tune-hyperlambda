// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [execute-file] slot to execute a file located at "/modules/db/connect.hl". It passes in two arguments, [host] and [port], which are dynamically retrieved from a configuration node using lambda expressions. The [execute-file] slot allows the execution of Hyperlambda files as if they were dynamic slots, with the arguments being evaluated before the file execution.
execute-file:/modules/db/connect.hl
   host:x:@.config/*/db/*/host
   port:x:@.config/*/db/*/port
