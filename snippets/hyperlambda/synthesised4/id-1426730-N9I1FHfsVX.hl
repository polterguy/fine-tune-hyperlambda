/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of a node specified by a lambda expression.
 * // The [get-value] slot is used to access the value of the node that the expression points to.
 * // In this case, the expression [x:@.domain] points to a node named [.domain].
 * // The code will return the value of the [.domain] node, which can be used for further processing or decision-making.
 * // Below is a breakdown of the slots used in this example:
 * // 1. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression.
 * // 2. [x:@.domain] - Lambda expression pointing to the [.domain] node to access its value.
