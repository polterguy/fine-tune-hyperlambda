// The code snippet converts the result of an HTTP POST request into a Hyperlambda representation using the [lambda2hyper] slot. This allows you to view or manipulate the HTTP response as a Hyperlambda object. The [lambda2hyper] slot takes an expression pointing to the HTTP POST request node and transforms its result into a Hyperlambda format.
