// 1. `-`: This iterator retrieves the previous sibling of the current node. In a Hyperlambda graph structure, nodes are typically organized in a hierarchical manner, where siblings are nodes that share the same parent. The `-` iterator is used to navigate to the node that is immediately before the current node in the list of siblings. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to compare or manipulate data that is organized sequentially, such as iterating through a list of items and needing to access the previous item for comparison or calculation purposes.
