// This Hyperlambda code executes a workflow action named "html-encode-body" by invoking the "magic.workflows.actions.execute" slot. It specifies the filename "/misc/workflows/actions/misc/html-encode.hl" to be executed, passing in the HTML content from the [.arguments] node's [body] child as an argument. The [execute] slot facilitates the invocation of a predefined workflow action, allowing for dynamic execution of Hyperlambda files with specified arguments.
