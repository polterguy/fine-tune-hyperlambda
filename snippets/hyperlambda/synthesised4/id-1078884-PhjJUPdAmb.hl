/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the ".arguments" node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are children of the ".arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `token` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "token". It is used to specifically access the "token" argument from the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to retrieve the value of a "token" argument passed to it. This is useful in scenarios where you need to validate or process a token, such as in authentication or authorization workflows.
