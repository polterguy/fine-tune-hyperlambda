It uses an inner join between the MediaType and Track tables, applies a filter on media type names, groups by MediaTypeId, and orders by the aggregate count.
data.select:"\n/*\n * Selects media types and aggregate of counts, and orders by count descending.\n * Make sure you select the chinook database before execxuting the script.\n */\nselect mt.Name, count(mt.MediaTypeId) as Amount \n  from MediaType mt\n    inner join Track t on mt.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId\n  where mt.Name like @filter\n  group by mt.MediaTypeId\n  order by Amount desc;\n"
