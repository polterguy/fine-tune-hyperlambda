// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node. The expression [x:@.dp/#] refers to the current node being iterated over, and the value is set to "checked". This is typically used within a loop or iteration context where [.dp] is a reference to the current node in the iteration.
set-value:x:@.dp/#
