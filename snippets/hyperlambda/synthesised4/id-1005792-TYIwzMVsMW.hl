 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you need to access or manipulate the parent node's properties or children from a child node's context.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is commonly used to iterate over all child nodes to perform operations or evaluations on them.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "data.read". It is used when you want to specifically target nodes with this name for further operations or evaluations.
