/*
 * 1. `@.iterations`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "iterations" within the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors and siblings until it finds a match.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve a node that keeps track of the number of iterations in a loop or process, allowing the developer to access or modify this count.
 * - It might be used in a scenario where the number of iterations is needed to control the flow of a program, such as determining when to stop a loop or trigger an event after a certain number of iterations.
