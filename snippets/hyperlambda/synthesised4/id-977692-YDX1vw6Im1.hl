// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot, which executes its child nodes when none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are met. In this example, the [set-value] slot is used within the [else] block to change the value of the [display-class] node to "red". The [else] slot does not require a condition, and its child nodes are executed directly if reached.
else
   set-value:x:@.display-class
