/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. It moves one level down to the next node in the sequence. This is useful when you need to access a node that is directly below the current node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it is used to access all children of the elder sibling node that was retrieved by the `+` iterator. This is useful for iterating over or accessing all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes retrieved by the first `*` iterator. This is useful for accessing a deeper level in the hierarchy, specifically the grandchildren of the elder sibling node.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This third `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes retrieved by the second `*` iterator. This allows access to the great-grandchildren of the elder sibling node, providing a way to traverse multiple levels of the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 5. `content` - This iterator filters the nodes retrieved by the previous iterators to only include those with the name "content". This is useful for targeting specific nodes within a complex structure, especially when you are only interested in nodes with a particular name or type.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include navigating a deeply nested data structure to find and process nodes named "content" that are located at a specific depth relative to a starting node. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to extract or manipulate content data from a structured document or configuration file.
