// The [case] slot is used to define a condition within a [switch] statement, allowing for branching logic based on the value of an expression. In this example, the [case] slot checks if a large integer value matches a specific condition. If the condition is met, the associated lambda block is executed. This is useful for handling different scenarios based on varying integer values, especially when dealing with large numbers.
