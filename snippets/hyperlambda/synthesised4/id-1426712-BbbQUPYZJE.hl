// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.select] slot to execute an SQL query that retrieves the maximum completion value for each unique prompt from the "ml_requests" table, filtered by a specific user ID, and where both the "questionnaire" and "context" fields are set to 1. The results are grouped by the "prompt" field. The [user_id] parameter is dynamically passed into the query using a lambda expression that references the [user_id] node from the [.arguments] node.
data.select:@"
select prompt, max(completion) as completion
   from ml_requests
   where user_id = @user_id and questionnaire = 1 and context = 1
   group by prompt"
   user_id:x:@.arguments/*/user_id
