// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-name] slot to dynamically change the name of nodes referenced by an expression. It sets the name of nodes to the value derived from the [prompt] argument, effectively renaming nodes based on input. The [set-name] slot is crucial for dynamically altering node structures in Hyperlambda.
