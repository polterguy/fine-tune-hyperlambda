/*
 * 1. `@.buffer` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "buffer" from the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the name "buffer". This is useful when you want to access a specific node that is not a direct child of the current node but exists somewhere in the hierarchy above it.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "buffer" node. It is used to access every child node under the "buffer" node, regardless of their names. This is useful when you need to process or manipulate all the children of a specific node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to gather all data stored under a "buffer" node, which might be used for temporary storage or caching purposes. For example, if "buffer" is used to store intermediate results of a computation, this expression can help in accessing all those results for further processing or aggregation.
