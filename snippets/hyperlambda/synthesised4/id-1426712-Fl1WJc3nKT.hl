// This Hyperlambda code snippet is part of an error handling routine that executes when a certain condition is not met (likely from a preceding [if] statement). It performs the following actions: 1) It uses [unwrap] to evaluate and process all expressions within the current context, specifically targeting nodes that are siblings and children of the current node. 2) It sends a signal using [sockets.signal] to a specified session, transmitting an error message with details such as the status and error message from a previous HTTP POST request. 3) It resets the value of an [iterations] node to 0 using [set-value], likely to control or restart a loop or process. The slots involved are: [else], [unwrap], [sockets.signal], [args], [set-value].
