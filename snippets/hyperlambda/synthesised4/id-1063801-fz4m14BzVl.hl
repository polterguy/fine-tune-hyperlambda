/*
 * 1. `@.reference` - This iterator searches for the first node named "reference" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It stops as soon as it finds the first match. This is useful for finding a specific node in the hierarchy without traversing siblings.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "reference" node. It is used to access the children nodes regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `url` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "url" among the children of the "reference" node. It is used to pinpoint specific nodes by name after retrieving a broader set of nodes with the `*` iterator.
