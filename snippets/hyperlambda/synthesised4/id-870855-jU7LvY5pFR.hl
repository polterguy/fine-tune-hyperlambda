// This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the value of the [.body] node by loading the content of a file specified in the [template-file] node within the [.arguments] node. The [set-value] slot is used to assign the content loaded by [io.file.load] to [.body]. The [io.file.load] slot retrieves the file content, and the expression in [set-value] ensures the correct node is targeted for value assignment.
set-value:x:@.body
   io.file.load:x:@.arguments/*/template-file
