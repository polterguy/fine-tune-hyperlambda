// 1. `-`: This iterator retrieves the previous node or the node above it in the Hyperlambda hierarchy. It is used to access the younger sibling of the current node, allowing you to navigate upwards in the node structure. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to reference or manipulate a node that precedes the current node in the execution flow.
