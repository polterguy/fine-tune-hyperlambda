/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code attempts to establish a connection to a database named "magic" using a generic connection string. It then executes a SQL query to count the number of entries in the "log_entries" table. If the connection and query execution are successful, it logs a success message to the console. The code is structured within a [try] block, which is typically used for exception handling, although no [.catch] or [.finally] blocks are provided here.
 * // 1. [try] - Begins a block of code that may throw exceptions.
 * // 2. [data.connect] - Connects to the "magic" database using a generic connection string.
 * // 3. [data.select] - Executes a SQL query to count entries in the "log_entries" table.
 * // 4. [console.log] - Logs a success message to the console if the previous operations succeed.
