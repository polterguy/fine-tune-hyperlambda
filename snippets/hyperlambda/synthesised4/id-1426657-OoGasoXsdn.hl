// The code constructs a URL by concatenating a base URL with a path extracted from a node's attribute. It uses [set-value] to assign the concatenated result to the [.url] node. The [strings.concat] slot combines the base URL, a forward slash, and the value of an [href] attribute from a referenced node. The [get-value] slots retrieve the base URL and the [href] attribute value.
set-value:x:@.url

      get-value:x:@.base
      .:/
      get-value:x:"@.dp/#/*/\\@href"
