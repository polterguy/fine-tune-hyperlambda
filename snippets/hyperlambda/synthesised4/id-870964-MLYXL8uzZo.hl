 * This Hyperlambda code adds a new node with the name [signal] to the current node's children. The [referrer] node is added as a child to the [signal] node, and its value is set by referencing the value of the [referrer] node in the current context. This allows for dynamically adding nodes and setting their values based on existing node references. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node to the current node's children.
 * 2. [referrer] - Sets the value of the [referrer] node by referencing an existing node's value.
