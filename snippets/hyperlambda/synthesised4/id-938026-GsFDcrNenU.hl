/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [flag] node is false using the [not] slot, and if so, sets the value of the [outcome] node to "Flag was false". It demonstrates conditional execution based on the negation of a boolean value. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional check.
 * 2. [not] - Negates the boolean value of its child node.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [flag] node.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 5. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [outcome] node.
 * 6. [.] - Provides the static string "Flag was false" as the new value.
