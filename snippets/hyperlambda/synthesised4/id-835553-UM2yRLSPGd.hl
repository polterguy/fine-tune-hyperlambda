// The code snippet demonstrates how to execute a SQL select query using the [data.select] slot in Hyperlambda. It specifies the SQL query to be executed through a lambda expression [x:@.sql] and explicitly sets the database type to SQLite using the [database-type] argument. This allows the query to be executed against a SQLite database, returning the results as a lambda object.
data.select:x:@.sql
   database-type:sqlite
