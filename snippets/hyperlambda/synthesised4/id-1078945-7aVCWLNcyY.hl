/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts the expression by looking for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for the node by its name.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the `.arguments` node. It effectively expands the search to include every direct child node under `.arguments`.
 * 
 * 3. `prompt` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `prompt`. It will return the first node named `prompt` that is a child of any node retrieved by the previous `*` iterator.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to extract a specific `prompt` node from a list of arguments, such as when processing input data for a function or an API endpoint that requires a prompt as part of its parameters.
 * - It could also be useful in a validation routine where you need to check if a `prompt` node exists among the arguments provided to a Hyperlambda slot or function.
