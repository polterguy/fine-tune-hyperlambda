// Adds nodes to the destination specified by the expression, where it inserts a [result] node and a [finish_reason] node. The [result] node is populated with the value from the [invoke] node's [result] child, and the [finish_reason] node is populated with the value from the [invoke] node's [finish_reason] child. This allows for dynamically appending results and reasons for completion to a specified location in the node graph.
