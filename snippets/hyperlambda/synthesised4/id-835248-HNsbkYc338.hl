// This Hyperlambda code throws an exception with a message indicating that the maximum number of requests for the model has been reached for the month. The exception is made public, meaning it will propagate to the client, and it sets the HTTP status code to 500, indicating a server error. The [throw] slot is used to raise the exception, while [public] and [status] specify the visibility and HTTP status code respectively.
