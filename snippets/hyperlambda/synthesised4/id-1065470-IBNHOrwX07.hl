// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it should search for a node by name. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node in your Hyperlambda structure that is not a direct child or descendant of the current node. In this context, it would typically be used to access a node containing SQL-related data or commands, which might be needed for further processing or evaluation within the Hyperlambda code.
