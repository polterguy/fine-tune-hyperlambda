// This Hyperlambda code checks if the "Content-Type" header of an HTTP GET request starts with the string "text/plain". The [strings.starts-with] slot is used to perform this check, where the expression points to the "Content-Type" node within the headers of the HTTP GET request. If the "Content-Type" starts with "text/plain", the condition will evaluate to true.
strings.starts-with:x:@http.get/*/headers/*/Content-Type
   .:text/plain
