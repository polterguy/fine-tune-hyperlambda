/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It is used to navigate to the node immediately following the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. This can be useful when you need to reference or manipulate a node that is positioned directly below the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it is used to access all child nodes of the elder sibling node retrieved by the `+` iterator. This is useful for operations that need to consider all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `.lambda` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `.lambda`. It is used to specifically target nodes that are named `.lambda`, which might represent a lambda function or a specific section of code within the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. Here, it is used to access all child nodes of the `.lambda` node. This allows for operations or evaluations on all components or statements within the `.lambda` block.
 * 
 * 5. `.type` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `.type`. It is used to specifically target nodes that are named `.type`, which might represent type declarations or specifications within the context of the `.lambda` block.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to navigate and manipulate type declarations within lambda functions in a Hyperlambda script. For example, if you have a script with multiple lambda functions and you need to ensure that all type declarations within these functions meet certain criteria, this expression can help you access and evaluate those type nodes efficiently.
 * - Another use case could be to extract type information for documentation or validation purposes, ensuring that all lambda functions adhere to expected type constraints.
