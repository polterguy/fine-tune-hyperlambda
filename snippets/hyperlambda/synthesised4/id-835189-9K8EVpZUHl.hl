// The code uses the [strings.split] slot to split the value of a node referenced by a complex expression. The expression targets a specific node by navigating through its hierarchy using iterators, and the split operation is performed using the '#' character as the delimiter. The resulting parts of the split operation are returned as separate nodes.
