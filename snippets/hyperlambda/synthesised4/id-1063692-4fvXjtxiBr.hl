/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. In the context of Hyperlambda, it means moving to the next node below the current one in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the node that is directly below the current node in the sequence.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current result set. After moving to the elder sibling using the `+` iterator, the `*` iterator will access all children of that sibling node. This is useful for iterating over or processing all child nodes of a specific sibling node.
