// The [case] slot is used within a [switch] construct in Hyperlambda to define a specific condition or value that, when matched, will execute its associated lambda object. Each [case] node must have a value, which can be a constant or an expression, and it is compared against the evaluated value of the [switch] node. If a match is found, the corresponding [case] node is executed.
