/*
 * 1. `@.iterations`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "iterations" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards through the ancestors and older siblings. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is defined earlier in the structure, such as retrieving a configuration or counter value that is used in multiple places within the Hyperlambda code.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a loop counter or iteration limit defined earlier in the code to control the number of iterations in a loop.
 * - Retrieving a configuration setting or parameter that influences the behavior of subsequent code sections.
