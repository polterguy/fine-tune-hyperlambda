// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to query a database table named "users" and select records where the "id" column is equal to 1. The [where] clause is used to specify the condition, and the [and] slot is used to combine multiple conditions, although in this case, there is only one condition. The [id.eq:int:1] specifies that the "id" column should be equal to the integer value 1.
data.read
   table:users

      and
