// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to concatenate strings to form a SQL query with specific ordering and limit conditions. It uses the [set-value] slot to update the [.sql] node by appending an "order by" clause for "keyword_count" and "keyword_density" in descending order, followed by a "limit" clause. The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate the existing SQL query with these additional clauses, incorporating the limit value from the [.arguments] node. The slots used are: [set-value], [strings.concat], [get-value].
set-value:x:@.sql
   strings.concat:x:@.sql
      get-value:x:@.sql
      .:" order by keyword_count desc, keyword_density desc limit "
      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/limit
