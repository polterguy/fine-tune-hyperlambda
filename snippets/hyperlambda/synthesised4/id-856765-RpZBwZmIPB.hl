// The code uses the [case] slot to implement a switch-case-like structure. It evaluates the value of the [gpt-4-vision-preview] node and executes the corresponding case block if a match is found. If no match is found, the [default] block is executed. This structure allows for conditional execution based on the value of [gpt-4-vision-preview].
case:gpt-4-vision-preview
