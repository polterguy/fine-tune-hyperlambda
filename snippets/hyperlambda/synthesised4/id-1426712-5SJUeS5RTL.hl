// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied with the expression `x:+/*/*`, which means it will evaluate the node two levels down from its current position. This allows for the forward evaluation of expressions within a lambda object, ensuring that the value is computed before the lambda object is executed.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
