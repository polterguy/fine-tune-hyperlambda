// This code snippet retrieves the value of the [finish_reason] node from the first choice in a JSON-converted lambda structure and assigns it to the [finish_reason] node in the current context. It uses [set-value] to update the node's value and [get-value] to extract the desired information from the lambda object.
set-value:x:@.finish_reason
