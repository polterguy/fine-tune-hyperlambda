// This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if the status code of an HTTP POST request is less than 300. If the condition is true, it implies that the HTTP request was successful, as status codes below 300 typically indicate success in HTTP responses. The [lt] slot is used for this comparison, where [x:@http.post] retrieves the status code from the HTTP POST request, and [.:int:300] provides the integer value 300 for comparison.
lt:x:@http.post
   .:int:300
