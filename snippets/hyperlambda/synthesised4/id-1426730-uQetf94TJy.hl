/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of a [case] slot within a [switch] construct to handle different scenarios based on the value of a node named [AINIRO]. The [switch] slot evaluates the value of [AINIRO] and executes the corresponding [case] block when a match is found. This allows for conditional execution of code based on the value of [AINIRO], enabling different actions to be performed for different cases.
 * 
 * 1. [case] - This slot is used within a [switch] construct to define a block of code that should be executed when the value of the [switch] matches the value specified in the [case].
 * 2. [AINIRO] - This is the node whose value is being evaluated by the [switch] construct to determine which [case] block to execute.
