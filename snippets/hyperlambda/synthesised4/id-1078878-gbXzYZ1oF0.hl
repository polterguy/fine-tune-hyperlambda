/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `.dp` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and `.dp` suggests it's a private or internal node, typically used for temporary data or processing purposes.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator retrieves the value of the `.dp` node as a node by reference. This means it accesses the node that is stored as the value of the `.dp` node, allowing for modifications to the original node rather than working with a copy.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous step. It allows for accessing all direct descendants of the node referenced by the `.dp` node's value.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a loop or processing function where you need to iterate over all children of a node stored in `.dp`, possibly for transformation or aggregation tasks.
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where `.dp` is used as a temporary storage for a node whose children need to be processed or evaluated in sequence.
