// The [unwrap] slot in this code evaluates expressions before the node is reached, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions inside a lambda object. The expression "x:+/*/*" will be evaluated, and its result will be used before the node execution proceeds. This is useful for dynamically resolving node values or structures before further processing.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
