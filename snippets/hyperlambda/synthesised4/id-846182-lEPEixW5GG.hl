// The code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [add] slot in Hyperlambda to dynamically add a node with a specific value to a destination node's children collection. In this example, a node named [primary] with a boolean value of true is appended to all children of the [.tmp] node. This operation allows for the dynamic modification of node structures by adding new nodes to existing ones.
add:x:@.tmp/*
