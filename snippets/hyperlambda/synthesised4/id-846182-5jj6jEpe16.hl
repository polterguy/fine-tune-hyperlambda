/*
 * The code uses the [strings.regex-replace] slot to remove any occurrences of a pattern matching a regular expression from a string. The pattern is defined as a space followed by square brackets containing numbers and commas. The replacement is an empty string, effectively deleting the matched pattern from the original string. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.regex-replace] - Invokes the regex replace operation on the string.
 * 2. [.] - Specifies the regular expression pattern to match.
 * 3. [.] - Defines the replacement string, which is empty in this case.
