// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [throw] slot to raise an exception with a custom message. The [public] slot is set to true, making the exception visible to the client, and the [status] slot is set to 400, indicating a "Bad Request" HTTP status code. This setup is useful for handling client errors in a web application.
throw:Your request is longer than what this type is configured to allow for
   public:bool:true
   status:int:400
