/*
 * This expression is used to navigate through a node structure in Hyperlambda. Below is a breakdown of each component in the expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@strings.split`: This iterator starts by selecting the first node in the current context with the name "strings.split". The `@` symbol is used to find a node by its name, starting from the current node and searching through its siblings and their descendants.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all the children of the node that was selected by the previous iterator. The `*` symbol is used to access all child nodes of the current node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you want to perform operations on all the child nodes of a "strings.split" node, such as processing or transforming the data contained within these nodes.
 * - It might be useful in a context where you need to iterate over the results of a string split operation, assuming that each result is stored as a child node under a "strings.split" node.
