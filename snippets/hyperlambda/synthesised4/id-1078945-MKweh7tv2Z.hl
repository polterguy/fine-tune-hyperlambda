// 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and looking through its siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific node within a larger structure, such as retrieving session information in a web application to manage user sessions or store session-specific data.
