/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It uses the "@" symbol to search for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for locating specific nodes that are expected to exist in the current execution context, such as argument nodes in a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "arguments" node found in the previous step. The asterisk (*) is used to access all children, allowing you to iterate over or manipulate each argument node individually. This is commonly used when you need to process or validate multiple arguments passed to a function or slot.
