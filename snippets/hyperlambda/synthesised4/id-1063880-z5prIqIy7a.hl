 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an HTTP endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `headers` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "headers". It is used to specifically access the "headers" argument, which typically contains HTTP headers or similar metadata in the context of an HTTP request or function call.
