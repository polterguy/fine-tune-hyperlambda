// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to insert a node structure into the node referenced by [.dp]. The inserted structure contains two nodes: [tokens] with an integer value of 128000, and [chat] with a boolean value of true. This operation is typically used to dynamically modify a graph object by adding new nodes to it.
