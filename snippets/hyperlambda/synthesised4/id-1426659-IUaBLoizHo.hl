/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if an HTTP GET request did not return a successful status code (i.e., not between 200 and 299). If the condition is true, it converts the HTTP response to a Hyperlambda object, logs an error message with the URL and error details, and returns the HTTP response. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional check.
 * 2. [not] - Negates the following condition.
 * 3. [and] - Combines multiple conditions.
 * 4. [mte] - Checks if the HTTP status code is more than or equal to 200.
 * 5. [lt] - Checks if the HTTP status code is less than 300.
 * 6. [.lambda] - Executes if the condition is true.
 * 7. [lambda2hyper] - Converts the HTTP response to a Hyperlambda object.
 * 8. [log.error] - Logs an error message with details.
 * 9. [url] - Logs the URL that was attempted to be accessed.
 * 10. [error] - Logs the error details.
 * 11. [return] - Returns the HTTP response.
