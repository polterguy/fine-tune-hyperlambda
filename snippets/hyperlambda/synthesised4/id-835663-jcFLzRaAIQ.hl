// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the [distinct_column] argument is one of the specified legal values. It validates that the value of [distinct_column] is one of the predefined column names from the "campaigns" table, such as "campaign_id", "name", "start_date", "end_date", "budget", or "status". If the value does not match any of these, an exception is thrown.
