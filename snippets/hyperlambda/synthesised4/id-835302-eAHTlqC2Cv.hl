/*
 * The code uses an [if] statement to check if the value of the [is_pk] node, accessed through a [get-value] expression, is true. If the condition is met, it executes a lambda object that adds a node with a [primary] attribute set to true to the [.tmp] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if the condition specified in its child node evaluates to true.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [is_pk] node.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the [if] condition is true.
 * 4. [add] - Adds a new node to the [.tmp] node.
 * 5. [primary:bool:true] - Sets the [primary] attribute of the new node to true.
