 * This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if the status code returned from an HTTP GET request is less than 300. If the status code is less than 300, the [lt] slot will return true, indicating a successful HTTP response. 
 * 
 * 1. [lt] - Compares the status code from the HTTP GET request to see if it is less than 300.
 * 2. [x:@http.get] - Retrieves the status code from the HTTP GET request.
 * 3. [.:int:300] - The integer value 300, used as the comparison threshold for the status code.
