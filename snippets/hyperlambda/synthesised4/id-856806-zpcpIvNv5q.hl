// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to append a string to an existing node's value. The [set-value] slot is used to modify the value of the [.sql] node by concatenating its current value with a new string using the [strings.concat] slot. The [get-value] slot retrieves the current value of the [.sql] node, and the concatenated string includes a comma followed by a newline character. This operation effectively appends ",\n" to the existing value of the [.sql] node.
