/*
 * 1. `@signal`: This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by its name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator. In this case, it retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. This is useful for accessing all direct descendants of a node.
 * 
 * 3. `snippets`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "snippets". It is used to narrow down the search to nodes with a specific name among the children of the "signal" node.
 * 
 * 4. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the nodes found by the previous iterator. Here, it retrieves all children nodes of the "snippets" node(s). This allows access to all direct descendants of the "snippets" node(s).
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access all the snippets related to a specific signal in a data structure, such as when processing or analyzing code snippets associated with different signals in a software application.
