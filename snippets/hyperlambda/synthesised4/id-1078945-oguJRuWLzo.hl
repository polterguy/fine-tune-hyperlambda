/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to access the arguments node, which is typically used to pass parameters or data into a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any parameters or data that have been passed into the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `prompt` - This iterator filters the children nodes to find the first node with the name "prompt". It is used to access a specific parameter or piece of data that has been passed into the function or slot, specifically the "prompt" node in this case.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function or slot to retrieve a specific argument named "prompt" that has been passed into the function. This is useful in scenarios where you need to process or manipulate the value of the "prompt" argument, such as in a text generation or natural language processing task.
