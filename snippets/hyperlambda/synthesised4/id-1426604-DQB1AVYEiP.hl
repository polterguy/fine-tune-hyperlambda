/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to change the value of nodes. It sets the value of all nodes referenced by its main expression to the value obtained from another node. The [set-value] slot takes an expression pointing to multiple nodes as its destination, and a single source expression as its value. The source expression must return exactly one result, while the destination expression can modify multiple nodes simultaneously.
 * // 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of nodes referenced by its expression.
 * // 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a node specified by its expression.
