/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the number of tokens in a given text (referred to by [.tmp]) is less than 4000 using the [lt] slot. If the condition is true, it sets the value of [.context] to the value of [.tmp] using [set-value]. The [openai.tokenize] slot is used to calculate the number of tokens in the text. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional statement.
 * 2. [lt] - Compares if the number of tokens is less than 4000.
 * 3. [openai.tokenize] - Calculates the number of tokens in [.tmp].
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 5. [set-value] - Sets the value of [.context] to [.tmp] if the condition is met.
 * 6. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of [.tmp].
