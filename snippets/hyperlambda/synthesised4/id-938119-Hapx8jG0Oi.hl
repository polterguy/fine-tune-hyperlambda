// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of [.testResult] is less than 100 using the [lt] slot. If the condition is true, it sets the value of [.result] to "Normal range" using the [set-value] slot. The [if] slot is used to conditionally execute the [.lambda] block based on the comparison result.
