/*
 * 1. `@lambda2hyper`: This iterator searches for the first node named "lambda2hyper" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node with the specified name. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to quickly locate and reference a specific node named "lambda2hyper" within a larger Hyperlambda structure. 
 * - It is useful in scenarios where you need to access or manipulate data or functionality encapsulated within a node named "lambda2hyper" without knowing its exact position in the hierarchy.
