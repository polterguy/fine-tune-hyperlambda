// The [add] slot is used to append nodes to a destination node's children collection. In this example, it adds a [bar] node to the [.data] node, with its value being the result of evaluating the expression pointing to the [foo] node within [.data]. The [add] slot evaluates its children before adding them, allowing dynamic node creation based on existing data.
add:x:@.data

      bar:x:@.data/*/foo
