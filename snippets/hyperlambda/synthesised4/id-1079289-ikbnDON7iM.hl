/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator searches for the first node named "sql" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings, until it finds a node with the name "sql". This is useful when you want to reference a SQL-related node that is defined somewhere above or alongside the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a SQL query or connection string that is defined earlier in the Hyperlambda code.
 * - Accessing configuration or setup information related to SQL operations that are shared across multiple parts of the Hyperlambda script.
