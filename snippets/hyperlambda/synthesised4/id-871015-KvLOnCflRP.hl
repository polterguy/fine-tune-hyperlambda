// This Hyperlambda code checks if any data exists from a data source using the [exists] slot. If data is found, it logs the request headers and adds them to a log using [add] and [get-nodes]. It then logs a message indicating potential abuse and throws an exception with a public message and a status code of 401, indicating the user is blocked from accessing the AI chatbot.
