/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of its previous result set. It starts the expression by selecting the node immediately following the current context node. This is useful when you want to operate on nodes that are directly below the current node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - The first `*` retrieves all children nodes of the node selected by the `+` iterator. This allows you to access every child node of the elder sibling node identified in the previous step.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - The second `*` retrieves all children nodes of each node from the previous result set. This step is used to further drill down into the hierarchy, accessing the next level of nodes.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - The third `*` retrieves all children nodes of each node from the previous result set, continuing the pattern of descending into the hierarchy. This allows you to reach deeper levels of nested nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `content` - This final iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "content". It selects nodes at the deepest level of the hierarchy specified by the previous iterators that have the name "content".
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression might include scenarios where you want to extract or manipulate data specifically located in "content" nodes that are nested within a certain structure. For example, it could be used to gather all "content" nodes from a specific section of a document or configuration file, assuming the structure follows the pattern described by the iterators.
