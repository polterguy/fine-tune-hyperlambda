/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using the [data.read] slot with a SQLite database. The code specifies a left join between two tables, Medications and Patients, based on the PatientID column. The [join] slot is used to define the join type and the condition for the join. The [columns] slot specifies an aggregate function, represented by [aggregate_functor], whose result is aliased as "result". The [where] slot is used to define conditions for filtering the data, although it is currently empty. The [group] slot specifies the column to group the results by, represented by [group_column]. Finally, the [return-nodes] slot is used to return the results of the query execution.
 * 
 * 1. [data.read] - Initiates a SQL query execution.
 * 2. [database-type] - Specifies the type of database, in this case, SQLite.
 * 3. [table] - Specifies the primary table for the query, Medications.
 * 4. [join] - Defines a left join with the Patients table based on the PatientID.
 * 5. [columns] - Specifies the columns to be selected, including an aggregate function.
 * 6. [where] - Placeholder for conditions to filter the results.
 * 7. [group] - Specifies the column to group the results by.
 * 8. [return-nodes] - Returns the results of the query execution.
