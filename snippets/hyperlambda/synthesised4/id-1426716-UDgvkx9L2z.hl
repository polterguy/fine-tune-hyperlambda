/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [strings.split] slot in Hyperlambda to split a string into multiple parts based on a specified delimiter. In this case, it splits the string found in the [invocation] node within the [.arguments] node, using ":" as the delimiter. The result is a set of nodes, each containing a segment of the original string that was separated by the ":" character. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.split] - Splits the string specified in its expression into multiple parts based on the delimiter provided as a child node.
 * 2. [.] - Specifies the delimiter ":" used for splitting the string.
