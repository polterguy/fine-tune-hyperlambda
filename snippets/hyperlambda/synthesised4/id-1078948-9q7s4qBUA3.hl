/*
 * 1. `@.model` - This iterator searches for the first node named "model" in the current context. It is useful for narrowing down the search to a specific part of the node structure where the "model" node is expected to be found.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "model" node. It is useful for accessing any direct descendants of the "model" node, allowing further filtering or processing.
 * 
 * 3. `max_context_tokens` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "max_context_tokens" among the children of the "model" node. It is useful for extracting specific configuration or parameter values related to the model's context token limit.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the maximum context token limit for a language model configuration to ensure input data does not exceed this limit.
 * - Accessing model configuration details for validation or logging purposes in a system that manages multiple models.
