 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [math.decrement] slot to decrease the value of a node. 
 * // The [math.decrement] slot is used to decrement the value of the node specified by the expression in its value. 
 * // In this example, the value of the [iterations] node is decremented by 1, as no step value is provided, which defaults to 1.
 * // 1. [math.decrement] - Decrements the value of the [iterations] node by 1.
