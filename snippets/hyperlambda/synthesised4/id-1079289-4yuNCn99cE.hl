// 1. `@.no`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will not traverse siblings but will only look at the current node and its ancestors. This is useful when you need to find a specific node that is an ancestor of the current node, such as when you want to retrieve configuration settings or contextual information stored higher up in the node hierarchy.
