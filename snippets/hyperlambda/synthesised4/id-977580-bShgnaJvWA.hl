// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to insert a new record into a "users" table using the [data.create] slot. It specifies the table name as "users" and uses the [values] node to define the columns and their respective values, which are dynamically retrieved from the [.arguments] node for "username," "email," and "age". This approach ensures that user input is safely incorporated into SQL queries, mitigating the risk of SQL injection attacks.
data.create
   table:users
   values
      username:x:@.arguments/*/username
      email:x:@.arguments/*/email
      age:x:@.arguments/*/age
