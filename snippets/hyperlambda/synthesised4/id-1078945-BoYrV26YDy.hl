/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda) of the previous result set. It's used to move downwards in the hierarchy to the next sibling node.
 * 
 * 2. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access every child node under the current node.
 * 
 * 3. `/*` - This iterator again retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It further drills down into the hierarchy to access deeper levels of child nodes.
 * 
 * 4. `/*` - This iterator once more retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It continues to delve deeper into the hierarchy to reach even further nested child nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `/content` - This iterator filters the previous result set to return only nodes with the name "content". It is used to specifically target nodes named "content" among the descendants.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to navigate through a complex hierarchical structure to find and retrieve nodes named "content" that are deeply nested within the structure.
 * - It might be useful in scenarios where you need to extract specific data from a deeply nested XML or JSON-like structure, such as retrieving content nodes from a document or data feed.
