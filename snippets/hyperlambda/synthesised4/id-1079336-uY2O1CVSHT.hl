/*
 * 1. `@data.select` - This iterator starts by locating the first node named `data.select`. It searches through the current node's siblings and ancestors to find this node. This is useful when you want to begin your search from a specific node in your data structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - After finding the `data.select` node, this iterator retrieves all of its direct children nodes. This is helpful when you want to process or analyze all elements directly under a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator further retrieves all children of each node found in the previous step. This allows you to delve deeper into the hierarchy, accessing another level of nodes beneath each child of `data.select`.
 * 
 * 4. `keyword_count` - Finally, this iterator filters the results to only include nodes named `keyword_count`. This is useful when you're specifically interested in nodes that hold keyword count information, perhaps for tasks like keyword analysis or frequency counting.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include analyzing keyword distribution in a dataset or extracting keyword-related metrics from a structured data source.
