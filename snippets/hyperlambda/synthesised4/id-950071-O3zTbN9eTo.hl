// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. It is executed when all preceding conditional slots evaluate to false, and it sets the value of the node referenced by [@.dp/#] to "restock". The [else] slot does not require a condition and directly contains its execution logic as child nodes.

   set-value:x:@.dp/#
