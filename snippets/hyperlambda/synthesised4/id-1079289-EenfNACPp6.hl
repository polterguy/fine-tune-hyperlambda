/*
 * 1. `@data.select`: This iterator searches for the first node in the current context with the name "data.select". It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings, until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might not be a direct child of the current node but exists somewhere in the surrounding context.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator. It is used to access all direct child nodes of the "data.select" node. This is useful when you want to perform operations on or gather information from all the children nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used in scenarios where you need to iterate over or manipulate all child nodes of a specific "data.select" node, such as when processing a collection of data entries or configurations stored under that node.
