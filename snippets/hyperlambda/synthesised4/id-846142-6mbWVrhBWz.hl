// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] statement to define a specific condition and its corresponding execution path. When the [switch] node's evaluated value matches the [case] node's value, the children of that [case] node are executed. The [case] slot must have a value, which can be a constant or an expression, and it works in conjunction with other [case] nodes and an optional [default] node within the [switch] construct.
