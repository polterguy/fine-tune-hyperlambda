/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by finding the first node with the name ".arguments" in the current context or hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot, often at the root level of a Hyperlambda file or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the ".arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or slot, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `aggregate_function` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "aggregate_function" among the children of the ".arguments" node. It is used to specifically access the "aggregate_function" argument, which might define a function or operation to be applied to a data set, such as sum, average, etc.
