// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] block to define a specific condition that, when matched, triggers the execution of its associated child nodes. In this context, the [case] slot has a value of "double", meaning that if the evaluated value of the [switch] matches "double", the corresponding actions defined under this [case] node will be executed.
