// This Hyperlambda code replaces occurrences of a substring within a target string with another specified string. It uses [set-value] to update the value of [.target-string] by invoking [strings.replace], which searches for a substring specified by [get-value:x:@.search-for] and replaces it with the value obtained from [get-value:x:@.replace-with]. The process effectively modifies the target string in place.
set-value:x:@.target-string
   strings.replace:x:@.target-string
