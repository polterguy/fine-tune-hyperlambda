// // The [case] slot is used within a [switch] block to define a specific condition to match against the evaluated value of the [switch]. If the value of the [switch] matches the value of a [case], the code within that [case] block is executed. In this example, the [case] slot is defined with the value "h1", meaning it will execute its child nodes if the [switch] evaluates to "h1".
