// The [join] slot in Hyperlambda is used to synchronize multiple asynchronous [fork] operations. It waits for all [fork] invocations directly beneath it to complete and then merges the results back into the original node structure. This is useful for parallel processing tasks where the results need to be consolidated after execution.
