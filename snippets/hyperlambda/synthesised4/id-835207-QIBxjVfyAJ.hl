// This code snippet demonstrates how to add a time span of 7 days to the current date and time using Hyperlambda. The [math.add] slot performs the addition operation, where [date.now] retrieves the current date and time, and [time] specifies the time span to be added, in this case, 7 days. The result is a new date and time, 7 days ahead of the current date.
