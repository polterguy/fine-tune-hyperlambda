// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, [unwrap] is applied to the node with the "+" expression, which evaluates the expression and assigns the result to the node. The use of [unwrap] allows for forward evaluation of expressions, making it useful when invoking lambda objects with expressions that need to be evaluated before execution.
