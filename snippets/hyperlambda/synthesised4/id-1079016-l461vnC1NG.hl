/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it) of its previous result set. It is used to move from the current node to the next node in the sequence, which is useful when you want to process or evaluate nodes that are adjacent to each other in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access the immediate children of a node, allowing for operations or evaluations on all child nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator further retrieves all children nodes of the nodes obtained from the previous `*` iterator. This is useful for accessing a deeper level of the hierarchy, specifically the grandchildren of the initial node.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - The third `*` iterator continues to retrieve all children nodes of the nodes obtained from the previous `*` iterator. This allows for accessing great-grandchildren of the initial node, enabling operations on nodes that are several levels deep in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 5. `content` - This iterator filters out any nodes not having a name of "content" from the previous result set. It is used to specifically target nodes named "content" within the hierarchy, allowing for operations or evaluations on these nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to process or extract information from nodes named "content" that are located several levels deep in a hierarchical structure, starting from the elder sibling of the current node. 
 * - It could be useful in content management systems where you need to retrieve and manipulate content data that is nested within multiple layers of categories or sections.
