/*
 * This Hyperlambda code is designed to perform a SQL query on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "Employees" table. It utilizes a left join to connect the "Employees" table with itself, using an alias "ReportsTo" for the joined table. The join condition is set to match the "ReportsTo" column in the "Employees" table with the "EmployeeID" column in the "ReportsTo" alias. This structure is useful for hierarchical data, such as organizational charts where employees report to other employees.
 * 
 * The code specifies a placeholder "aggregate_functor" in the [columns] section, which is intended to be replaced with an actual SQL aggregate function like COUNT, SUM, etc., and assigns its result to an alias "result". The [where] clause is prepared to include conditions, although none are specified, and the [group] section indicates grouping by a "group_column". Finally, the [return-nodes] slot retrieves all nodes from the result of the [data.read] operation, allowing for further processing or output. This setup is ideal for generating reports or summaries from hierarchical employee data.
