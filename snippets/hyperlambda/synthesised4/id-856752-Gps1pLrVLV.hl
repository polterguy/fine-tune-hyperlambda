// Checks if the status of the HTTP GET request's content is "succeeded" by evaluating the node's value against the string "succeeded". This is done using the [eq] slot, which compares two values for equality. The expression [x:@http.get/*/content/*/status] navigates to the status node within the content of an HTTP GET response.
eq:x:@http.get/*/content/*/status
