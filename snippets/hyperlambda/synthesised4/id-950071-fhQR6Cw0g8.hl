// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node. It targets the node referenced by the expression [@.dp/#] and assigns it the new value "urgent restock". This operation is typically used within a loop or conditional structure where [.dp] represents a node being processed or iterated over.
