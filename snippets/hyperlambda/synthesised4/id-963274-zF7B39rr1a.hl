// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the node that is being referenced by the expression. The expression uses a combination of iterators to navigate the node structure, specifically targeting the value of the node that is currently being iterated over in a [for-each] loop or similar construct. The [get-value] slot is used to extract the value from the node, which is identified by the expression.
