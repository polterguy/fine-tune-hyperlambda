// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [src] node is equal to 1 using the [eq] slot. If the condition is true, it executes the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [result] node to "OK". The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, and the [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [src] node for comparison.
