/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of all nodes referenced by the expression [@.dp/#/*/prompt] to the value obtained from the expression [@http.post/*/content/*/choices/0/*/message/*/content]. It effectively updates the [prompt] node within the [dp] node structure with content retrieved from a specific path in the result of an HTTP POST operation. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of nodes referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [@.dp/#/*/prompt] - Expression pointing to the [prompt] node within the [dp] node structure.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a node specified by its expression.
 * 4. [@http.post/*/content/*/choices/0/*/message/*/content] - Expression pointing to the content node within the result of an HTTP POST operation.
