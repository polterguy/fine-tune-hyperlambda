/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement to execute conditional logic based on the value of a node. The [switch] node evaluates the value of [.val] and executes the first matching [case] node. If no [case] matches, the [default] node is executed. This allows for branching logic similar to traditional programming languages' switch/case constructs.
 * // 
 * // 1. [.val] - This node holds the value to be evaluated by the [switch] statement.
 * // 2. [.result] - This node will store the result of the executed [case] or [default] block.
 * // 3. [switch] - This node evaluates the value of [.val] and determines which [case] or [default] block to execute.
 * // 4. [case:bar] - This block is executed if the value of [.val] is "bar".
 * // 5. [case:foo] - This block is executed if the value of [.val] is "foo".
 * // 6. [default] - This block is executed if none of the [case] values match the value of [.val].
