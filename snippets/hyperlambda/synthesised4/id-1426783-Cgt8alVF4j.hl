// The Hyperlambda code snippet retrieves the user ID from a Server-Side Event (SSE) message. It uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and extract the user ID from the nested structure of the SSE message. The expression navigates through the hierarchy of nodes to locate the [.user-id] node within the SSE message.
