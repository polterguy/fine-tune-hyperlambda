/*
 * 1. `@.fields`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "fields" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches upwards through the node's ancestors and their siblings to find the first occurrence of a node named "fields". 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to access a configuration or data node named "fields" that is defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure. For example, if you have a list of fields defined at the beginning of your Hyperlambda code, and you need to reference this list later on, this expression allows you to access that node without needing to know its exact position in the hierarchy.
