/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is useful for accessing the root arguments node in a Hyperlambda script or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any parameters or data nodes that are direct children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `data` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `data` among the children of the `.arguments` node. It is useful for accessing a specific data node that holds important information or parameters needed for further processing.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda script to access a specific data node passed as an argument to a function or endpoint, allowing the script to perform operations or logic based on the data contained within that node.
