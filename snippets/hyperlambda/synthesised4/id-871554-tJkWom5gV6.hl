// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [data.execute] slot to execute a SQL delete statement. The [data.execute] slot is typically used when no result is expected from the SQL operation, such as in delete or update operations. In this example, it attempts to delete records from the "hyperlambda" table, although it is advised to use more specific slots like [data.delete] when possible for better error handling and abstraction.
