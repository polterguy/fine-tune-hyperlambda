/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [signal] slot to send a signal with specific parameters. It constructs a signal using values retrieved from various nodes, including a connection string, a database name from a nested [for-each] loop, and a table name. The [signal] slot is used to trigger an event or action with these parameters. 
 * 
 * 1. [signal] - Sends a signal with specified parameters.
 * 2. [connection-string] - Retrieves the connection string value.
 * 3. [database] - Retrieves the database name from a nested [for-each] loop.
 * 4. [table] - Retrieves the table name from the current node.
