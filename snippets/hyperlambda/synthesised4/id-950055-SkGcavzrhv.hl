 * The code iterates over each child node of [.car-parts] using [for-each], and sets their values to "checked" by referencing each node with [.dp] and using [set-value]. This effectively marks all car parts as "checked". 
 * 
 * 1. [for-each] - Iterates over each child node of [.car-parts].
 * 2. [set-value] - Sets the value of the current node to "checked".
 * 3. [.dp] - References the current node being iterated.
