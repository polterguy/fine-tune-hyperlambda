// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot to handle a specific integer value, 403, which typically represents a "Forbidden" HTTP status. When this case is matched, it triggers the [throw] slot to raise an exception with the message "403 Forbidden – You don’t have permission to perform this action". This effectively communicates to the client that the requested action is not permitted due to insufficient permissions.
case:int:403
   throw:403 Forbidden – You don’t have permission to perform this action
