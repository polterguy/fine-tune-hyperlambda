/*
 * 1. `.` - This retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is often used to navigate upwards in the node hierarchy to access parent nodes.
 * 2. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all nodes directly beneath the current node.
 * 3. `data.read` - This retrieves nodes named "data.read" from the previous result set. It is used to filter nodes by name, selecting only those with the specified name.
 * 4. `*` - Similar to the second step, this retrieves all children nodes of the "data.read" nodes. It is used to access all nodes directly beneath "data.read".
 * 5. `columns` - This retrieves nodes named "columns" from the previous result set. It filters nodes by name, selecting only those with the specified name.
 * 6. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the "columns" nodes. It is used to access all nodes directly beneath "columns".
 * 7. `distinct_functor` - This retrieves nodes named "distinct_functor" from the previous result set. It filters nodes by name, selecting only those with the specified name.
 * 
 * This expression is used to navigate through a hierarchical structure, starting from the parent node, and traversing down through nodes named "data.read", "columns", and finally "distinct_functor". It is useful for accessing specific nodes in a structured data set, particularly when dealing with nested or hierarchical data.
