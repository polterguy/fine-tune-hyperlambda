// The provided Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and resolve the expression before reaching the node where it's referenced. It targets the node specified by the expression, which navigates through the hierarchy to find the [.url] node within a [.lambda] node. The [unwrap] slot ensures that the [.url] node is evaluated and its value is resolved before being used in subsequent operations.
