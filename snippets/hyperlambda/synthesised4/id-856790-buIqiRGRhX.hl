// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [remove-nodes] slot to remove specific database nodes from a signal graph. It targets nodes with specific database names such as "information_schema", "mysql", "performance_schema", and "sys", effectively cleaning up the signal by excluding these system databases. This operation is enclosed within a [case:mysql] block, indicating its relevance to MySQL database operations.
