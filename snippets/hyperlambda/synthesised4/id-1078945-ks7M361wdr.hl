/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (the next node below in the Hyperlambda structure) of the previous result set. It starts the expression by moving to the next node in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to evaluate or manipulate nodes that are directly below the current node in a sequence.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it is used to access all children of the elder sibling node obtained from the `+` iterator. This allows for operations on all direct descendants of the elder sibling node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - The second `*` retrieves all children nodes of the nodes obtained from the previous `*` iterator. This effectively moves two levels down in the hierarchy, accessing grandchildren nodes of the elder sibling.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - The third `*` retrieves all children nodes of the nodes obtained from the previous `*` iterator. This moves three levels down, accessing great-grandchildren nodes of the elder sibling.
 * 
 * 5. `content` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "content". It is used to specifically target nodes named "content" at the third level of descendants from the elder sibling node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to extract or manipulate "content" nodes that are deeply nested within a specific sibling structure. For example, in a document processing system, it could be used to gather all "content" nodes from a specific section of a document that is structured with multiple nested levels.
