// The code demonstrates converting a lambda object to a CSV string and back to a lambda object, preserving type information. It uses [lambda2csv] to transform the lambda data into CSV format, capturing type details, and [csv2lambda] to revert the CSV back to the original lambda structure, using the type information to ensure accurate conversion. This process maintains data integrity, including handling null values, allowing roundtrip conversions without losing type or node name information.
