// This Hyperlambda code executes a workflow action using the [execute] slot. It specifies the action's name as "config-name" and the file path to the workflow configuration as "/misc/workflows/actions/misc/config.hl". The [arguments] node provides a key-value pair, where the key is "magic:smtp:from:name", which is likely used within the workflow to retrieve or manipulate configuration settings related to SMTP email sending.
