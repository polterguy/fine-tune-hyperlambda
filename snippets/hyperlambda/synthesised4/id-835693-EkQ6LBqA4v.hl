// The code snippet demonstrates how to set an HTTP response header to control caching behavior. By using the [response.headers.set] slot, it sets the "Cache-Control" header to "public, max-age=300", indicating that the response can be cached by any cache and should be considered fresh for 300 seconds. This is useful for optimizing performance by reducing server load and improving response times for frequently accessed resources.
