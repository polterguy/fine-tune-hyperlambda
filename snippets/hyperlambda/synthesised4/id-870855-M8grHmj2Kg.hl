// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [name] exists within the [.arguments] node and ensures that its value is not null or empty. The [and] slot combines these two conditions, using [exists] to verify the presence of the [name] node and [neq] to confirm that the [name] node's value is not null. If both conditions are met, the [and] slot evaluates to true.
