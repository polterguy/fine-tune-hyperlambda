/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to navigate to the top of the node hierarchy, which can be useful when you need to start a new search or operation from the very beginning of the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it is used to access all children of the root node, allowing further navigation through the node hierarchy.
 * 
 * 3. `.invoke` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name `.invoke` from the previous result set. It filters out any nodes that do not match this name, focusing on nodes that are likely involved in some invocation process.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. Here, it is used to access all children of the `.invoke` nodes, enabling further navigation down the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 5. `while` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name `while` from the previous result set. It filters out any nodes that do not match this name, focusing on nodes that represent a while loop construct.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it is used to access all children of the `while` nodes, which could include conditions and loop bodies.
 * 
 * 7. `.lambda` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name `.lambda` from the previous result set. It filters out any nodes that do not match this name, focusing on nodes that represent lambda expressions or functions.
 * 
 * 8. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. Here, it is used to access all children of the `.lambda` nodes, allowing further navigation into the lambda expressions.
 * 
 * 9. `http.post` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name `http.post` from the previous result set. It filters out any nodes that do not match this name, focusing on nodes that are likely involved in making HTTP POST requests.
 * 
 * 10. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it is used to access all children of the `http.post` nodes, which could include headers, body, and other HTTP request configurations.
 * 
 * 11. `payload` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name `payload` from the previous result set. It filters out any nodes that do not match this name, focusing on nodes that contain the payload data for the HTTP POST request.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include extracting or manipulating the payload data of an HTTP POST request within a dynamically constructed lambda expression, particularly in scenarios where the payload needs to be modified or analyzed before sending the request.
