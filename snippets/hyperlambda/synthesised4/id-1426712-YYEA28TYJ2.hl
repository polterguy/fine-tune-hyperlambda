/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet evaluates multiple conditions using the [and] slot to ensure that a node named "data" exists within the [.arguments] node, is not null, and is not equal to an empty value. It uses [exists] to check for the presence of the node, [not-null] to ensure it has a value, and [neq] to confirm the value is not empty. If all conditions are true, the [and] slot will evaluate to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Combines multiple conditions and evaluates to true only if all conditions are true.
 * 2. [exists] - Checks if a node named "data" exists within the [.arguments] node.
 * 3. [not-null] - Ensures the "data" node has a non-null value.
 * 4. [neq] - Confirms the value of the "data" node is not equal to an empty value.
