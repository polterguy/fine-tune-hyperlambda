// The Hyperlambda code adds nodes with specific children to a target node set. It uses the [add] slot to insert a node structure containing [name] and [type] as children into each node referenced by the expression [../*/return-nodes/*/args]. This operation allows for dynamically modifying the node graph by appending new data structures to existing nodes.
