/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you want to navigate upwards in the node hierarchy to access or manipulate the parent node's properties or children.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is commonly used to iterate over all children nodes to perform operations or checks on each of them.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "data.read". It is used to specifically target nodes that represent a data reading operation or structure.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used here to access the children of the "data.read" node, which might represent different aspects or configurations of the data reading process.
 * 
 * 5. `columns` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "columns". It is used to specifically target nodes that represent column configurations or data structures within the data reading operation.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used here to access the individual column nodes or configurations within the "columns" node.
 * 
 * 7. `aggregate_functor` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "aggregate_functor". It is used to specifically target nodes that define or represent aggregation functions or operations to be applied to the data columns.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include navigating a data processing configuration to apply or modify aggregation functions on specific data columns, or extracting information about the aggregation operations defined for a data reading task.
