/*
 * - `@.dp`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" from the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and ".dp" specifies the exact name of the node it is searching for. This is useful for accessing a specific node that is expected to be present in the current execution context, often used in loops or dynamic slot executions where ".dp" represents the current data point or item being processed.
 * 
 * - `#`: This iterator dereferences the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator. If the value of the ".dp" node is another node or a node reference, the `#` iterator will return that node by reference. This is particularly useful when you want to work with or modify the actual node that is the value of ".dp", rather than just a copy of its value. This is commonly used in scenarios where you need to update or manipulate the node's value directly, such as in a [for-each] loop where ".dp" represents the current item being iterated over. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * 1. In a [for-each] loop, to access and modify the value of each item being iterated over.
 * 2. In a dynamic slot execution, to work with a node that is passed as a reference, allowing for direct manipulation of its value.
