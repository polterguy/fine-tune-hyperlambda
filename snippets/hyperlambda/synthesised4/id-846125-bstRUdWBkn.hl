// The code checks if a node named [stream] under [.arguments] either does not exist or has a boolean value of false. It uses [or] to evaluate these conditions, returning true if either condition is met. The first condition uses [not-exists] to verify the absence of the [stream] node, while the second condition uses [eq] to check if the [stream] node's value is false.
