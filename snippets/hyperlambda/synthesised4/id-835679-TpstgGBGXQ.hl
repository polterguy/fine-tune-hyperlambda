/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database using the [data.read] slot.
 * // It specifies the database type as SQLite and selects specific columns from the "clients" table.
 * // The [where] slot is prepared for adding conditional logic to filter the results.
 * // 1. [data.read] - Initiates a read operation from the database.
 * // 2. [database-type] - Specifies the type of database, in this case, SQLite.
 * // 3. [table] - Indicates the table to read data from, here it's "clients".
 * // 4. [columns] - Lists the specific columns to be retrieved from the table.
 * // 5. [where] - Prepares a conditional clause for filtering the data.
