// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node it references is reached, allowing for forward evaluation. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate the expression at the next sibling node, ensuring that its value is resolved before the [dest] node is processed. This is useful for dynamically setting values based on expressions within a Hyperlambda graph.
