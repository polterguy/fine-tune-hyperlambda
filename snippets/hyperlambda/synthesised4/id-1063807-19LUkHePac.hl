/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy until it finds the node named "arguments". This is useful for accessing the arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which typically contains input parameters or configurations.
 * 
 * 2. `@.arguments` - This is a repetition of the previous iterator, which again retrieves the first node named "arguments" before the current node in the hierarchy. This could be used to ensure that the correct "arguments" node is being accessed, especially in complex graphs where multiple "arguments" nodes might exist.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it will retrieve all children nodes of the second "arguments" node found by the previous iterators. This is useful for accessing all parameters or configurations defined within the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 4. `database` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "database". It is used to specifically access the node named "database" among the children of the "arguments" node. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate the value or configuration related to a database within the arguments.
