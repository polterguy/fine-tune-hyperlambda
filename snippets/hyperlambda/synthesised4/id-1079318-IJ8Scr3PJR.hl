/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate upwards in the node hierarchy to access the parent node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the parent node obtained from the previous iterator. It is used to access all direct descendants of the parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the result set from the previous iterator to only include nodes with the name "data.read". It is used to specifically target nodes named "data.read" among the children of the parent node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to find and process all "data.read" nodes that are direct children of the parent node of the current node. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to read or manipulate data from specific nodes in a structured data set.
