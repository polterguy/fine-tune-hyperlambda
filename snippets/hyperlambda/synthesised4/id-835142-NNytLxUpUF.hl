/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specific location in a Hyperlambda node structure. The [get-nodes] slot is used to retrieve a subset of nodes from the [.arguments] node, specifically nodes within the index range of 1 to 1000, and these nodes are then added to the path specified by the [add] slot. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified location in the node structure.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves a subset of nodes from the [.arguments] node, specifically nodes within the index range of 1 to 1000.
