// The code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [and] slot, which evaluates to true only if all its child conditions are true. It includes a condition using [type.eq], which checks if the type of a node is equal to a specified type. The [type.eq] slot compares the type of a node, referenced by the expression [x:@.type], to ensure it matches the expected type. This setup is useful for validating multiple conditions simultaneously, ensuring all criteria are met before proceeding.
