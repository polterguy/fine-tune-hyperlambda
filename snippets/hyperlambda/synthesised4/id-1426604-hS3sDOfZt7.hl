// The [endpoints.list] slot retrieves and returns metadata about all available HTTP endpoints in the system. This includes information such as the HTTP verb, URL, accepted arguments, and any descriptions provided in the [.description] node. It semantically traverses and loads all Hyperlambda files that can be resolved from a valid URL, providing a comprehensive overview of the endpoints. This information is used in the Magic dashboard to display endpoint metadata and facilitate endpoint management and testing.
