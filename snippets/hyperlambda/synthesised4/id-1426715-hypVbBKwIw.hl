// This Hyperlambda code performs a division operation where it first subtracts the value of the [max_tokens] node from 131072, and then divides the result by 2. The [math.subtract] slot calculates the difference between 131072 and the value retrieved from the [max_tokens] node, and the [math.divide] slot divides this difference by 2.
