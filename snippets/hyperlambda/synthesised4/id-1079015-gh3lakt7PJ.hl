/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name in the current context. In this case, it looks for the first node named "products" in the current execution context.
 * 2. `.products` - This specifies the name of the node to be retrieved. It is used in conjunction with the `@` iterator to locate the node named "products".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access a node named "products" in a Hyperlambda graph, which might contain a list of products or product-related data.
 * - It could be used in an e-commerce application to retrieve product information for further processing or display.
