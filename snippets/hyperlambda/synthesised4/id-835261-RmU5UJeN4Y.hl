// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specified location. It retrieves nodes using the [get-nodes] slot, which points to all children of the [.arguments] node, and appends them to the children of the [signal] node. This effectively merges the nodes under [.arguments] into the [signal] node's children, allowing for dynamic node manipulation and extension within a Hyperlambda script.
