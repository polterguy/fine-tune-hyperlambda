// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [return] slot to return a single node with a value. In this example, the [return] slot is used to return a node named [result] with the value "success". This is typically used within a dynamically created slot or an HTTP endpoint to signify the successful completion of an operation.
