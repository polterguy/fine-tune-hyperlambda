/*
 * This Hyperlambda code changes the name of nodes within a specific path. It targets nodes under [data.connect], [data.read], and [group] with the name [group_column], and sets their names to the value of [group_column] from the [.arguments] node. This is useful for dynamically renaming nodes based on argument values, allowing for flexible data manipulation. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the name of nodes specified by its expression.
 * 2. [x:@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column] - Expression pointing to nodes to be renamed.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/group_column] - Retrieves the value from [.arguments] to use as the new name.
