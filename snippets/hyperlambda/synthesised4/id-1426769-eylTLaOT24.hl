// This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.regex-replace] slot to remove a specific pattern from the value of nodes pointed to by the expression. It targets nodes with the name "data_type" under the current node's children, and removes any occurrence of a pattern matching " ([0-9,]+)", which represents a space followed by one or more digits or commas enclosed in parentheses. The [strings.regex-replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the regular expression pattern to match, and the second is the replacement string, which is empty in this case, effectively removing the matched pattern.
