// The code snippet demonstrates how to change the value of a node by converting its current value to a date type. It uses the [set-value] slot to modify the value of the node it points to, and the [convert] slot to transform the value from its original type to a date. The [convert] slot takes an expression pointing to the node to be converted and a [type] argument specifying the desired type, in this case, "date".
set-value:x:-
   convert:x:@.data
      type:date
