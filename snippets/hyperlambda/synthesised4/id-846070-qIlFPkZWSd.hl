/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet replaces double spaces with a single space in the value of the [.completion] node. It uses the [strings.replace] slot to search for occurrences of "  " (double spaces) and substitutes them with " " (a single space), effectively normalizing spacing in the text. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.completion] node.
 * 2. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of double spaces with a single space in the [.completion] node's value.
 * 3. [.] - Specifies the string to replace ("  ") and the replacement string (" ").
