/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a conditional operation using the [if] slot. It checks if the value of the [.allowed] node is equal to true. If the condition is met, it performs two actions within the [.lambda] block: it adds the first node from the result of a [sort] operation to the [.return] node, and decrements the value of the [max] node inside [.arguments] by 1. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional check.
 * 2. [eq] - Compares the value of [.allowed] to true.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the operations to execute if the condition is true.
 * 4. [add] - Adds the first node from the [sort] result to [.return].
 * 5. [math.decrement] - Decreases the value of [max] in [.arguments] by 1.
