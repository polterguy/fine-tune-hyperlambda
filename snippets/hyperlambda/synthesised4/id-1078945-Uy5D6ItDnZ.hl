/*
 * 1. `@.no-invocation`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no-invocation" starting from the current node and traversing upwards through its ancestors. It does not look at sibling nodes, only direct ancestors. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases: 
 * - This expression can be used to check if a specific configuration or flag node named "no-invocation" exists in the hierarchy of the current node. 
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you want to ensure a particular setting is applied globally or at a higher level in the node hierarchy before proceeding with further operations.
