// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [prefix] exists within the [.arguments] node, ensures it is not null, and verifies that its value is not an empty string. If all these conditions are true, the [and] slot evaluates to true. The code uses [exists] to confirm the presence of the node, [not-null] to ensure it has a value, and [neq] to check that the value is not an empty string.
