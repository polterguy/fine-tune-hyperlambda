/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and the dot before `arguments` specifies that it is looking for a node with this exact name, which is typically used to denote a node that contains arguments for a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each individual argument node that is a direct child of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `module` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `module` from the previous result set. It is used to specifically target nodes that are named `module` among the children of the `.arguments` node. This is useful when you want to extract or manipulate the value of a specific argument named `module`.
