// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [and] slot to evaluate a condition where the [name.like] slot checks if the 'name' column contains the substring "John". The [like] slot is used for pattern matching, and the "%" character acts as a wildcard, allowing for partial matches. This condition is part of a logical operation that will only evaluate to true if all its conditions, including this one, are true.
