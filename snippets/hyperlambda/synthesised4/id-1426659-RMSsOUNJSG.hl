/*
 * The code uses an [else] block to set the value of the [.tmp] node by concatenating the value of the [.base] node, a "/" character, and the trimmed value of a string obtained from [strings.trim-end]. This operation is performed only if previous conditions in an [if] or [else-if] block evaluate to false. 
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes the following code block if previous [if] or [else-if] conditions are false.
 * 2. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.tmp] node.
 * 3. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 4. [get-value] (first occurrence) - Retrieves the value of the [.base] node.
 * 5. [.] - Represents a static string value, in this case, a "/" character.
 * 6. [get-value] (second occurrence) - Retrieves the value from the result of [strings.trim-end].
