/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `file` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "file" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target nodes that represent files.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "file" node. It allows access to the properties or attributes of the file node.
 * 
 * 5. `name` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "name" among the children of the "file" node. It is used to access the name property of the file node, which could represent the file's name or identifier.
