// This Hyperlambda code snippet converts the value of the [threshold] node within the [.arguments] node to a double type using the [convert] slot, and then sets this converted value back to the [threshold] node using the [set-value] slot. The [convert] slot ensures that the value is interpreted as a double, which is useful for operations requiring numeric precision.
set-value:x:@.arguments/*/threshold
   convert:x:@.arguments/*/threshold
      type:double
