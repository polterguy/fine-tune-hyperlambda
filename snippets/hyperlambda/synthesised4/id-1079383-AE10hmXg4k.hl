/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which contains the parameters passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each individual argument node within the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `limit` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `limit` among the children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to specifically access the `limit` argument, which might represent a constraint or boundary in the context of the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include retrieving a specific argument value named `limit` from a set of parameters passed to a Hyperlambda function or endpoint, which could be used to control pagination, limit the number of results returned, or set a boundary condition for processing.
