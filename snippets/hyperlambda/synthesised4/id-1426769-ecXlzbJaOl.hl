// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement to evaluate a value and execute a corresponding [case] block. The [switch] node evaluates the value of [.val] and executes the matching [case] node, setting the [.result] node's value based on the matched case. If no [case] matches, the [default] node is executed. The code illustrates conditional branching using [switch], [case], and [default] nodes to determine the execution path based on the value of [.val].
