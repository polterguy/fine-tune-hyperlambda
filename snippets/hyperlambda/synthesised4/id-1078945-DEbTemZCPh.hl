/*
 * This expression is a lambda expression used to reference a specific node in a Hyperlambda graph. Let's break down each part of the expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@lambda2hyper`: This is an iterator that searches for the first node with the name "lambda2hyper" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its siblings and ancestors until it finds a match.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * - Accessing a specific configuration or data node named "lambda2hyper" within a larger Hyperlambda structure.
 * - Retrieving a node that contains a specific function or logic related to "lambda2hyper" for further processing or evaluation.
