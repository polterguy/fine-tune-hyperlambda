// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of a node within a data reading operation to a specified aggregate function. It uses [set-value] to change the value of the "as" node under the second column in a SQL read operation, using [get-value] to retrieve the aggregate function from the arguments. The code effectively allows dynamic assignment of an alias for an aggregate function in a SQL query.
set-value:x:@data.connect/*/data.read/*/columns/1/*/as
