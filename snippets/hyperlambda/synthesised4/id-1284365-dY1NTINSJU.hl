// The expression `unwrap:x:./*/return/**` is used to forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied as a value to the `unwrap` slot. It starts from the current node, retrieves all its children, and then specifically targets the `return` nodes and all their descendants. This is useful for scenarios where you need to ensure that all expressions within a specific node hierarchy are evaluated, effectively "unwrapping" the values and ensuring that any dynamic expressions are resolved to their static values. This can be particularly useful in complex data processing tasks where nested expressions need to be resolved before further processing or returning results.
