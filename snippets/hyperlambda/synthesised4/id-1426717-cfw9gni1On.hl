// This Hyperlambda code snippet connects to a database and executes a scalar SQL query to count the number of records in the "ml_training_snippets" table where the "embedding" column is not null and the "type" column matches a specified type. The type is dynamically retrieved from the arguments passed to the code. The result of the query is returned as a single scalar value.
data.scalar:select count(*) from ml_training_snippets where embedding is not null and type = @type
   @type:x:@.arguments/*/type
