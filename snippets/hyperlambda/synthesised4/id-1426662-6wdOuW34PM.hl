/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [hyper2lambda] slot to convert a string representation of Hyperlambda into a lambda object. It targets the first node within the value of the [.dp] node, which is assumed to be a string containing Hyperlambda code. The [hyper2lambda] slot parses this string and transforms it into an executable lambda object. 
 * 
 * 1. [hyper2lambda] - Converts a string representation of Hyperlambda into a lambda object.
 * 2. [x:@.dp/#/0] - Specifies the expression pointing to the first node within the value of the [.dp] node, which contains the Hyperlambda string to be converted.
