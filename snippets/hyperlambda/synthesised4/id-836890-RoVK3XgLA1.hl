// The code connects to an SQLite database to read data from the "opportunities" table, performing a left join with the "clients" table using "client_id" as the join condition. It selects the count of records and applies a limit of 1 to the results. The [join] slot specifies the join type and condition, while [columns] defines the aggregation, and [limit] restricts the number of returned records.
