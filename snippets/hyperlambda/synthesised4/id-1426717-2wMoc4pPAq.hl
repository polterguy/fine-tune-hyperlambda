 * // This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.embeddings-model] node to the value retrieved from a specific node path. 
 * // It uses [set-value] to change the value of [.embeddings-model] and [get-value] to fetch the value from a node named [vector_model] located within a nested structure under [data.read].
 * // 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node specified in its expression.
 * // 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value from the node path specified in its expression, which is used as the new value for [.embeddings-model].
