/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot, typically at the beginning of a Hyperlambda file or slot execution.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access all the parameters or data nodes passed as arguments.
 * 
 * 3. `data` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "data". It is used to specifically access a node named "data" among the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a specific data node within the arguments of a Hyperlambda function to perform operations or validations on it.
 * - Retrieving input data for processing within a dynamically executed slot or an HTTP endpoint.
