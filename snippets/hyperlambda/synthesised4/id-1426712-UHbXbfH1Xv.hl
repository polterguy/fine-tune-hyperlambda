// // This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [eq] slot to check if the value of the [model] node, located within the [.arguments] node, is equal to the string "o3-mini". If the value matches, the [eq] slot evaluates to true. The [eq] slot is used for equality comparison between two values, where both values must be exactly the same for the condition to be true. The first argument is obtained using a lambda expression pointing to the [model] node, and the second argument is a static string value.
eq:x:@.arguments/*/model
