// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of the string "[[type]]" within the node referenced by [.result] with the value obtained from the [type] node within [.arguments]. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [type] node, which is then used as the replacement string in the [strings.replace] operation.
strings.replace:x:@.result
