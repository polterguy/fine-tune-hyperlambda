// 1. `@.fixed` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "fixed" that is located before or above the current node in the hierarchy. It does not traverse sibling nodes, only direct ancestors and their children. This can be useful when you need to access a specific configuration or constant value that is defined earlier in the hierarchy and is meant to be reused across multiple parts of the Hyperlambda code.
