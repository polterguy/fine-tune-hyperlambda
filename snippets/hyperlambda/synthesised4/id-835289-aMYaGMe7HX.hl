// This Hyperlambda code checks if the "length" node exists and is not null within the current context. If both conditions are true, it appends the "length" value enclosed in parentheses to the existing SQL string. The slots used include [if] for conditional execution, [and] for logical conjunction, [exists] and [not-null] for checking the presence and non-null status of a node, and [strings.concat] for string concatenation.
