/*
 * 1. `@.cached-file`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "cached-file" from the current context. The `@` symbol is used to find nodes by name, and it will search through the current node's siblings and itself to find the first match. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to access a cached file node within a larger data structure, perhaps to retrieve metadata or content associated with a cached file.
 * - It might be used in a scenario where multiple files are being processed, and there's a need to quickly access a specific cached file by name for further operations like validation or transformation.
