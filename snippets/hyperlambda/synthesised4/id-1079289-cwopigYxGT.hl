// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `.sql` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, and the `.` indicates that it will start the search from the current node's context. This iterator is useful when you need to access a specific node that contains SQL-related data or commands within a larger Hyperlambda structure. A potential use case could be retrieving a SQL query or command that is stored within a node named `.sql` for execution or further processing.
