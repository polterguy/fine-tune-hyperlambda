// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it should look in the current node's context. This is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate a specific node named "sql" that is a sibling or a direct child of the current node.
