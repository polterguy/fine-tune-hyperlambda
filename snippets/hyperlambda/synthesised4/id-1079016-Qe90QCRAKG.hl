/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. It is used to move to the next node at the same hierarchical level.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It allows for accessing all child nodes directly under the current node.
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator again retrieves all children nodes, but this time it is applied to each of the nodes retrieved by the previous `*` iterator. This effectively drills down one more level in the hierarchy.
 * 4. `*` - The third `*` iterator continues the pattern, retrieving all children nodes of the nodes found by the previous iterator. This further deepens the traversal into the hierarchy.
 * 5. `content` - This final iterator filters the node set to only include nodes named "content". It ensures that only nodes with this specific name are selected from the previously retrieved node set.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to navigate a structured document or data set where you need to find the "content" nodes that are located three levels deep under the elder sibling of the current node. This might be useful in scenarios where data is organized in a hierarchical manner, and specific content needs to be extracted or processed.
