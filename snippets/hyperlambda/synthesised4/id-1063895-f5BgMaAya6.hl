/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by selecting the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. It is commonly used to access the arguments node in Hyperlambda, which typically contains the parameters passed to a slot or an endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument passed to the slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `cascading`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `cascading` from the children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to specifically target the argument named `cascading` within the arguments node.
