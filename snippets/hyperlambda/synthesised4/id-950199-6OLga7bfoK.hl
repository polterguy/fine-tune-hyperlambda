// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot, which executes its child nodes when all preceding [if] and [else-if] conditions evaluate to false. In this example, it sets the value of the [.register.status] node to "Registration failed" when none of the previous conditions are met.
