// This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Appointments" and "Doctors", using the [join] slot. The join is aliased as "DoctorID" and is based on matching the "DoctorID" columns from both tables. The [type] slot specifies the join type, and the [on] slot defines the condition for the join using the [and] slot to combine multiple conditions.
