/*
 * 1. `@.foo`: This iterator searches for the first node named ".foo" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first ".foo" node it encounters in its path.
 *    
 * 2. `-`: This iterator retrieves the younger sibling of the node found by the previous iterator. A younger sibling is the node immediately preceding the current node in the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to dynamically access a configuration or setting that is always located as a sibling node immediately before a ".foo" node, allowing for flexible and context-sensitive data retrieval.
