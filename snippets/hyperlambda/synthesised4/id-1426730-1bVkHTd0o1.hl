/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a new node with the name [crawl-delay] and a value derived from the [.crawl-delay] node to the node set referenced by the expression [@try/*/return]. The [add] slot is used to insert the new node as a child of the nodes returned by the expression. This operation allows for dynamically appending data to existing nodes within a graph structure.
 * // 1. [add] - Inserts a new node into the node set specified by the expression.
 * // 2. [crawl-delay] - The name of the new node being added.
 * // 3. [x:@.crawl-delay] - Expression to derive the value for the new [crawl-delay] node from the [.crawl-delay] node.
