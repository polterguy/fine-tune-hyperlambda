/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the given expression. It targets a specific node path within a hierarchical structure, specifically the [.auto_destruct] node under [.onafter] within [magic.ai.crawl-site]. The purpose is to evaluate and possibly execute the nodes or expressions found at this path, allowing dynamic behavior based on the structure's content.
 * 
 * 1. [unwrap] - Forward evaluates all expressions pointed to by the given expression.
 * 2. [x:./*/signal/=magic.ai.crawl-site/*/.onafter/*/.auto_destruct] - The expression path targeting the [.auto_destruct] node within the specified hierarchy for evaluation.
