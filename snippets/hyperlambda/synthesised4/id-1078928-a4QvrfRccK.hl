/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it should look within the current context or hierarchy level. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access session-related information or variables that are stored in a node named "session". It is useful in scenarios where you need to retrieve session data, such as user authentication details or session-specific settings, within a Hyperlambda script.
