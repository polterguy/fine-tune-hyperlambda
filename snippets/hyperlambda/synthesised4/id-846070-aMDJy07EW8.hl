// This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace all occurrences of the carriage return character ("\r") in the value of the node referenced by [.dp] with a space (" "). The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the string to be replaced, and the second is the string to replace it with. The expression [x:@.dp/#] retrieves the value of the node referenced by [.dp] for the replacement operation.
