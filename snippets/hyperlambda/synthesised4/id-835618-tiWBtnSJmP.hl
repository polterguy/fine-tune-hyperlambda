// This Hyperlambda snippet changes the name of nodes within a specific path. It uses [set-name] to rename nodes located at [@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column] to the value obtained from [get-value] at [@.arguments/*/group_column]. This operation is useful for dynamically renaming nodes based on provided arguments.
set-name:x:@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column
