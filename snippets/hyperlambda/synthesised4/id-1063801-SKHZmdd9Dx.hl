 * 1. `@.cur` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "cur" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It is useful for accessing a specific node by name that is located in the same level or higher up in the node structure.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node set. In this context, it will get all the children of the node named "cur". This is useful for iterating over or processing all child nodes of a specific parent node.
