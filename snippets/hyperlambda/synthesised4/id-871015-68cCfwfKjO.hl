// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a log entry using the [log.info] slot, capturing the list of HTTP request headers by invoking [request.headers.list]. The [add] slot is used to append the headers information to the log entry, ensuring that the details of the request headers are recorded for monitoring or debugging purposes. The expression "./*/log.info" specifies the location where the log entry should be added.
