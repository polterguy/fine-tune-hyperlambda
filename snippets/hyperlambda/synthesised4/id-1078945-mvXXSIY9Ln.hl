/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an HTTP endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `system_message` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "system_message". It is used to specifically access the "system_message" argument, if it exists.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to access and manipulate a specific argument named "system_message" that has been passed to it. For example, it might be used to log, validate, or modify the content of a system message before further processing.
