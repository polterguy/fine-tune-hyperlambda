// The code snippet logs a message when an error occurs during an OpenAI invocation. It uses the [add] slot to append a log entry to a specific path in the lambda hierarchy, indicating a failure in the OpenAI process. The [log.timeshift] slot records the error message "Something went wrong while invoking OpenAI" to help diagnose issues.
