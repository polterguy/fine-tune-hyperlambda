// The code demonstrates how to use the [mysql.select] slot in combination with the [strings.concat] slot to dynamically construct an SQL SELECT statement in Hyperlambda. The [mysql.select] slot is used to generate SQL for selecting data from a MySQL database, while the [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate strings to form the SQL query. This approach allows for dynamic SQL query generation by combining static strings and dynamic values.
