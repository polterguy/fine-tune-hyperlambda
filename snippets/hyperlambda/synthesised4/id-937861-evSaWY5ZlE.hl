// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from an SQL database, specifically targeting an "orders" table using a Microsoft SQL Server (mssql) dialect. It selects an aggregate count of all records in the "orders" table, aliasing the result as "count". The [limit] slot is set to 1, ensuring only one record is returned, which is the aggregate count. The [columns] slot specifies the columns to be selected, and the [database-type] slot indicates the SQL dialect to use.
