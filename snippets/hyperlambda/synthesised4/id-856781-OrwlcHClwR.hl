// The code snippet uses the [invoke] slot to execute a dynamic slot or method, passing in two arguments: [url] and [pattern]. The [url] argument is derived from the first node in the [sort] list, while [pattern] is taken from the current node being iterated, referenced by [.dp]. This setup is typically used to match or process URLs against patterns dynamically.
invoke:x:@.match
   url:x:@sort/0
