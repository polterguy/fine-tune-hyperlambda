// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, [unwrap] is applied with an expression that navigates to the next sibling and then retrieves all its children. This allows for pre-evaluation of the specified nodes, effectively "unwrapping" their values before they are processed further in the Hyperlambda execution flow.
