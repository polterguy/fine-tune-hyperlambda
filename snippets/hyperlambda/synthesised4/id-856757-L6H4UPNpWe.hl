// This Hyperlambda code constructs a URI by concatenating various components such as the request scheme, host, and a specific path, then appends a URL-encoded filename to the end. It uses [set-value] to assign the resulting URI to the [.uri] node, [strings.concat] to concatenate the components, and [strings.url-encode] to ensure the filename is safely appended as a query parameter.
