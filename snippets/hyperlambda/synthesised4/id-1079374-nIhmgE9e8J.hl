 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator searches for the first node named ".sql" within the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it should look for a node with the specified name. The ".sql" suggests that this node is likely a data segment or a configuration related to SQL, possibly containing SQL queries or database connection details.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving SQL queries or database connection configurations stored within a Hyperlambda structure.
 * - Accessing a specific SQL-related node to execute or manipulate its contents further in the Hyperlambda script.
