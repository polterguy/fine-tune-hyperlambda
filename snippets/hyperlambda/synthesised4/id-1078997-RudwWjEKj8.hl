/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node named ".dp" from the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it's looking for a node by name, and ".dp" specifies the exact name. This is useful for accessing a specific node that is expected to be present in the current execution context, often used in loops or dynamic slot executions where ".dp" represents the current data point or node being processed.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator dereferences the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is another node, and it returns this node by reference. This is useful when the value of a node is a complex structure or another node, allowing direct manipulation or access to its children.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It is used to access the entire set of child nodes, which is useful when you need to perform operations on all children or need to filter further among them.
 * 
 * 4. `Key` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "Key" among the children retrieved by the previous iterator. It is used to specifically target nodes with the name "Key", often used to extract specific data points or attributes from a larger set of nodes.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used in a context where you are iterating over a collection of data points, each represented by a ".dp" node, and you need to extract or manipulate the "Key" attribute of each data point.
 * - It can be used in data processing tasks where specific keys need to be extracted from a nested data structure for further processing or validation.
