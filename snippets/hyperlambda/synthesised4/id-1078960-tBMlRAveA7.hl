/*
 * 1. `@signal`: This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary, but does not traverse siblings. It is useful for locating specific nodes that might be nested within a larger structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. It is a broad selection tool that gathers all direct descendants, regardless of their names. This is useful when you need to process or analyze all children nodes without filtering them by name.
 * 
 * 3. `sitemap`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to only include those named "sitemap". It narrows down the selection to nodes of interest, which is useful for focusing on specific parts of the data structure.
 * 
 * 4. `*`: This final iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "sitemap" nodes. It allows access to the detailed contents or sub-elements within each "sitemap" node, which can be useful for further processing or analysis of the data contained within these nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include navigating a hierarchical data structure to extract or manipulate information related to a "sitemap" within a "signal" node, such as generating a website's navigation menu or analyzing the structure of a web application.
