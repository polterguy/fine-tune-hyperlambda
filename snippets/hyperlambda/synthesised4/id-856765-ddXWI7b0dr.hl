// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.execute] slot to perform an SQL update operation. It updates the "no_requests" field by incrementing it by 1 for records in the "ml_types" table where the "type" field matches the specified argument. The [data.execute] slot is used here to execute the SQL statement without expecting any return value.
data.execute:update ml_types set no_requests = no_requests + 1 where type = @type
   type:x:@.arguments/*/type
