// The code demonstrates the use of the [execute-file] slot to execute a Hyperlambda file located at "/whatever-file.hl". It passes two arguments, [arg1] and [arg2], whose values are dynamically evaluated from the [.args] node's children, specifically from [foo1] and [foo2]. This setup allows for the execution of the specified file with arguments that are resolved at runtime, facilitating dynamic and flexible file execution.
