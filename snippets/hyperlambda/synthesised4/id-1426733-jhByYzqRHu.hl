// The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expression provided, which in this case is a complex expression using multiple iterators. The expression "+/**" retrieves all descendants of the next sibling node of the current node. The [unwrap] slot will evaluate this expression before the node where it is referenced is reached, effectively replacing the node's value with the result of the expression.
