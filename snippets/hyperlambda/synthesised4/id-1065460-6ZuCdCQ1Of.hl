// 1. `@.no`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "no" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name, and the `.` signifies that it starts the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you want to access a specific node's value or its children nodes by its name within the current scope.
