/*
 * 1. `@.finish_reason`: This iterator searches for the first node named `finish_reason` that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. 
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression include:
 * - Checking the completion status of a task or operation by retrieving the `finish_reason` node, which might contain a reason or status message.
 * - In a workflow or process management system, this could be used to determine why a particular process or task ended, allowing for conditional logic based on the reason for completion.
