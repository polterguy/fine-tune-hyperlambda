/*
 * 1. `@.continue`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "continue" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name. The `.` before "continue" suggests that it will look for this node relative to the current node, meaning it will search among its siblings and itself. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a loop or conditional structure to check for a "continue" flag or signal, which might determine whether a loop should proceed to its next iteration or a process should continue executing.
 * - It could also be used in a context where different nodes represent different stages or steps in a process, and the presence of a "continue" node might indicate that the process should move forward to the next step.
