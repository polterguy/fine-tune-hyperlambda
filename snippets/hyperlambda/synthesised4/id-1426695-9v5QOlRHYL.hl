// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and extract the value of the [.session] node from a specific path within the current node structure. The path is defined by the expression "x:+/*/.sse/*/.session", which navigates through the node hierarchy to locate the desired [.session] node. The [unwrap] slot ensures that the value of the [.session] node is evaluated and returned before the node where [unwrap] is referenced is reached.
unwrap:x:+/*/.sse/*/.session
