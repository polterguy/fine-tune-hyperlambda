/*
 * The code connects to an "HR" database and retrieves the birth date of an employee with a specified username. It then checks if the employee is older than 18 years by subtracting the birth date from the current date and comparing the result to 18 years in days. If the employee is older than 18, it returns true. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.connect] - Connects to the "HR" database.
 * 2. [data.read] - Reads data from the "employees" table.
 * 3. [columns] - Specifies the "birth_day" column to be retrieved.
 * 4. [where] - Filters the data based on the "username" condition.
 * 5. [if] - Checks if the employee is older than 18.
 * 6. [mt] - Compares the age in days to 18 years.
 * 7. [math.subtract] - Subtracts the birth date from the current date.
 * 8. [date.now] - Retrieves the current date and time.
 * 9. [math.multiply] - Converts 18 years to days.
 * 10. [time] - Represents a time span of 365 days.
 * 11. [return] - Returns true if the employee is older than 18.
