/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate upwards in the node hierarchy to access the parent node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access all child nodes of the parent node retrieved by the previous `.` iterator.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "data.read" from the previous result set. It is used to filter out nodes that do not have the name "data.read" among the children nodes retrieved by the previous `*` iterator.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access all child nodes of the "data.read" nodes retrieved by the previous `data.read` iterator.
 * 
 * 5. `where` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "where" from the previous result set. It is used to filter out nodes that do not have the name "where" among the children nodes retrieved by the previous `*` iterator.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access all child nodes of the "where" nodes retrieved by the previous `where` iterator.
 * 
 * This expression is useful for navigating a hierarchical data structure to find specific nodes that match a pattern, such as retrieving all conditions specified under a "where" clause in a data reading operation.
