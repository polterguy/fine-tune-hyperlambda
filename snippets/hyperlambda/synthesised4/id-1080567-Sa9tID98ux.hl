/*
 * 1. `@.fields`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node named "fields" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, and the `.` implies that it starts from the current node's context.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "fields" node. The `*` symbol is used to access all immediate children of the node found by the previous iterator.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * 
 * - This expression can be used to access and manipulate all child nodes under a "fields" node, which might represent a collection of field definitions or data entries in a structured data set.
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you need to iterate over each field to perform operations like validation, transformation, or extraction of values.
