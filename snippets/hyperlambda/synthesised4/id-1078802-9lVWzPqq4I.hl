// 1. `@.content`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "content" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks for a sibling node named "content". This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name that is at the same level as the current node. A potential use case could be when you are processing a document structure and need to extract or manipulate the content section specifically.
