// The expression `unwrap:x:+/*` is used to forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied as a value to unwrap itself. In this context, it evaluates expressions that are children of the current node's elder sibling (the node immediately below it in the Hyperlambda structure) and returns the evaluated result. This is useful for scenarios where you want to pre-evaluate expressions before they are actually executed in the main flow of your Hyperlambda code, ensuring that any dynamic content or calculations are resolved beforehand.
