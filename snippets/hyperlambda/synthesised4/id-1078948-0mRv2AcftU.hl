/*
 * 1. `@math.divide`: This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "math.divide" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards through its siblings and ancestors until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate a specific node in a complex Hyperlambda structure, particularly when dealing with mathematical operations where you might need to reference a division operation node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the result of a division operation that has been previously defined in the Hyperlambda code.
 * - Accessing configuration or parameters related to a division operation for further processing or validation.
