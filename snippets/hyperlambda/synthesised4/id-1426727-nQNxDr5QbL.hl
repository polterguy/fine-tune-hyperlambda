 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [get-count] slot to count the number of nodes under the [urls] node, which is a child of the [signal] node. The result is the total number of [urls] nodes present. 
 * 
 * 1. [get-count] - Counts the number of nodes specified by the expression.
 * 2. [x:@signal/*/urls/*] - Expression pointing to all [urls] nodes under the [signal] node.
