/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It is useful when you need to start your search from a specific node in a potentially large and complex graph structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "hyper2lambda" node. It is useful for iterating over all direct descendants of a node, allowing you to perform operations or further filtering on them.
 * 
 * 3. `.arguments` - This retrieves the parent node of the current result set, which in this case would be the parent of any children nodes found under "hyper2lambda". It is useful for navigating back up the hierarchy to access sibling nodes or attributes of the parent node.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the ".arguments" node. It allows you to access all parameters or arguments defined under this node, which is common in configurations or function definitions.
 * 
 * 5. `_extra` - This retrieves nodes named "_extra" from the current result set. It is useful for filtering out specific nodes that might contain additional or optional data in a configuration or argument list.
 * 
 * 6. `=string` - This filters the nodes to only those whose value is exactly "string". It is useful for ensuring that you are working with nodes that have a specific value, which can be important for type checking or ensuring the correct configuration is used.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include filtering configuration nodes to find specific argument nodes with a value of "string" within a larger configuration or data structure, which can be useful in scenarios where you need to validate or process specific types of data.
