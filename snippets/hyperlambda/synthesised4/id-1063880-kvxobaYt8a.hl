/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda. In the context of an HTTP endpoint, this would be the node where all input parameters are stored.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node, which in this case is the "arguments" node. It allows you to access each individual argument that has been passed.
 * 
 * 3. `url`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "url". It is used to specifically target the "url" argument from the list of all arguments. This is useful when you need to extract or manipulate the value of the "url" parameter specifically.
