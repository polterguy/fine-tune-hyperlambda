// This Hyperlambda code manages a periodic task to delete old machine learning requests from a SQLite database. It first checks if a task named "delete-old-machine-learning-requests" exists and deletes it if found. Then, it creates a new task with the same name, scheduled to run every 72 hours. The task connects to a SQLite database and executes a SQL query to delete requests older than 14 days, logging the number of deleted entries. The slots involved include [tasks.list], [if], [exists], [tasks.delete], [tasks.create], [sqlite.connect], [sqlite.execute], and [log.info].
