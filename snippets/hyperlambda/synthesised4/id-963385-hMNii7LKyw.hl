// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [mssql.create] slot to insert a new record into the "customers" table in a Microsoft SQL Server database. The slot specifies the table name and the values for the "first_name" and "last_name" fields, which are set to "John" and "Doe" respectively. The slot ensures that SQL parameters are used to prevent SQL injection attacks.
mssql.create
   table:customers
