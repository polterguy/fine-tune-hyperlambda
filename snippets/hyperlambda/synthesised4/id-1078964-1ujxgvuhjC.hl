/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is often used to access the arguments passed into a function or slot, especially in the context of dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints where arguments are typically defined under an [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument passed into the function or slot, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `/pattern` - This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes that have the name "pattern". It is used to specifically access an argument named "pattern" within the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint to retrieve the value of an argument named "pattern" that has been passed in. For example, it could be used in a function that performs pattern matching or regex operations, where the pattern to be matched is provided as an argument.
