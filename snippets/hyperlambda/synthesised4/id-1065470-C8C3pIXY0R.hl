/*
 * 1. `@.words`: This iterator starts by finding the first node with the name "words" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it is looking for a node with this specific name.
 *    
 * 2. `*`: Once the "words" node is found, this iterator retrieves all of its children nodes. The "*" symbol is used to access all direct child nodes of the previously identified node. 
 * 
 * This expression is useful when you want to process or analyze all the child nodes of a specific node named "words". For example, if "words" contains a list of word nodes, this expression would allow you to access each word node individually for further operations like counting, filtering, or transformation.
