// This Hyperlambda code connects to the "orders" database and deletes records from the "orders" table where the "order_id" matches the provided argument. The [data.connect] slot establishes the database connection, while [data.delete] specifies the table and conditions for deletion using the [where] clause with an equality check on "order_id".
data.connect:orders
   data.delete
      table:orders
      where
         and
            order_id.eq:x:@.arguments/*/order_id
