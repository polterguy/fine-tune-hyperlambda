/*
 * The Hyperlambda code iterates over a list of files in a directory, checks if each file ends with ".css", and processes its path. If the condition is true, it splits the file path by "/" and "." to extract the file name, then adds the file name to a result node. The code demonstrates file filtering and manipulation using string operations and conditional logic.
 * 
 * 1. [for-each] - Iterates over each file in the directory.
 * 2. [if] - Checks if the current file ends with ".css".
 * 3. [strings.ends-with] - Determines if the file name ends with ".css".
 * 4. [strings.split] - Splits the file path by "/" to isolate the file name.
 * 5. [unwrap] - Evaluates the split path to extract the file name.
 * 6. [add] - Adds the extracted file name to the result node.
