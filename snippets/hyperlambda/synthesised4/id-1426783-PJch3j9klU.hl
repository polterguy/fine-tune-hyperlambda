/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add a new node to an existing node set. Specifically, it adds a new node under the [session] node, which contains a nested structure with a [role] node set to "assistant" and a [content] node whose value is dynamically retrieved from the [result] node. This is useful for dynamically updating or expanding a node structure based on current execution context or results.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node to the specified node set.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the root node of the new structure being added.
 * 3. [.] - Represents a nested node under the root node.
 * 4. [role] - A node with a static value "assistant".
 * 5. [content] - A node whose value is dynamically set from the [result] node.
