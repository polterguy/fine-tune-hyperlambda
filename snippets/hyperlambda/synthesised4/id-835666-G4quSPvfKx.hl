// This Hyperlambda code uses the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the [aggregate_column] argument is one of the specified valid values. If the [aggregate_column] is not one of the listed campaign attributes such as campaign_id, name, start_date, end_date, budget, or status, the validator will throw an exception. This ensures data integrity by restricting the input to predefined options.
