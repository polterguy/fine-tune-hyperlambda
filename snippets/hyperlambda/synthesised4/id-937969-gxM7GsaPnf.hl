// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each node within the [car-parts] node using [for-each]. For each node, it sets its value to a concatenated string consisting of the node's name followed by " is checked". The [set-value] slot updates the node's value, and [strings.concat] combines the node's name with the static string.
