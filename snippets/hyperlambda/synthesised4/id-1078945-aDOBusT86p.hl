/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access all the arguments provided to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `stream` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "stream". It is used to specifically access the "stream" argument if it exists among the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to retrieve the value of a specific argument named "stream" that was passed to the slot or function. This is useful in scenarios where you need to process or manipulate a data stream provided as an argument.
