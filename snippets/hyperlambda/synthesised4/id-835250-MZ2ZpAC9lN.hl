/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the value of the [.context] node to the value retrieved from the [.tmp] node. The [set-value] slot changes the value of the node specified in its expression, while the [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified in its expression. The code effectively copies the value from [.tmp] to [.context].
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node specified in its expression.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified in its expression.
