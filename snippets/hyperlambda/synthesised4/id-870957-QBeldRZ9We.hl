// Unzips a file specified by its full path to a target folder. The [io.file.unzip] slot uses the [full-path] node to determine the file to unzip, and the [folder] node to specify the destination directory. If the [folder] node is not provided, the current directory of the ZIP file will be used as the default extraction path.
io.file.unzip:x:@.full-path
