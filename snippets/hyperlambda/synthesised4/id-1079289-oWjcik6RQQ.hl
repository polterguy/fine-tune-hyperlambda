/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of its previous result set. It moves to the node directly below the current node in the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 2. `+` - This second `+` iterator again retrieves the elder sibling of its previous result set, moving further down to the next node in the sequence.
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It expands the current node to include all of its direct children.
 * 4. `*` - This final `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set, further expanding to include all descendants of the nodes retrieved by the previous `*`.
 * 
 * This expression is useful for navigating through a structured Hyperlambda graph to access nodes that are siblings and their descendants. A potential use case could be iterating over a list of sibling nodes and processing all their child nodes, such as aggregating data from a sequence of related nodes in a configuration or data file.
