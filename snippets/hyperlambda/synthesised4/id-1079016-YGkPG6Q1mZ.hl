/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "new-prompt" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access a specific node that is not a direct child of the current node but is somewhere in its ancestry or among its siblings. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: You might use this expression to retrieve configuration or metadata stored in a "new-prompt" node that is relevant to the current context but not directly nested within it.
