// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to insert a new record into the "ml_training_snippets" table using the [data.create] slot. The snippet specifies the table name and the values for each field, including [type], [prompt], [completion], and [uri]. The [type] field is dynamically set using an expression that retrieves its value from the [.arguments] node. The [prompt] and [completion] fields contain static strings, while the [uri] field holds a URL. This approach ensures that data is inserted securely, preventing SQL injection attacks.
