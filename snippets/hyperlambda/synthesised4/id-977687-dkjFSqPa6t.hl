/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the HTTP POST response status code is between 200 and 299, indicating a successful request. If true, it retrieves the "user-name" and "session-id" from the response content and assigns them to the respective nodes [.user-name] and [.session-id]. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional check.
 * 2. [and] - Combines multiple conditions that must all be true.
 * 3. [mte] - Checks if the HTTP POST status code is greater than or equal to 200.
 * 4. [lt] - Checks if the HTTP POST status code is less than 300.
 * 5. [.lambda] - Executes the following nodes if the conditions are true.
 * 6. [.user-name] - Declares a node for storing the user name.
 * 7. [set-value] - Assigns the value of the user name from the HTTP response to [.user-name].
 * 8. [get-value] - Retrieves the user name from the HTTP response content.
 * 9. [.session-id] - Declares a node for storing the session ID.
 * 10. [set-value] - Assigns the value of the session ID from the HTTP response to [.session-id].
 * 11. [get-value] - Retrieves the session ID from the HTTP response content.
