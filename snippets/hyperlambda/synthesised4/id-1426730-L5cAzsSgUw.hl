/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add a node to a specified location in a Hyperlambda structure. The [add] slot is used to insert a new node under the [.disallow] node, with the value being the result of evaluating the expression [x:@.value]. This operation effectively appends a child node to [.disallow] with its value derived from the [x:@.value] expression.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node to the specified location.
 * 2. [x:@.disallow] - Expression pointing to the [.disallow] node where the new node will be added.
 * 3. [.] - Represents the new node being added.
 * 4. [.:x:@.value] - Sets the value of the new node to the result of the expression [x:@.value].
