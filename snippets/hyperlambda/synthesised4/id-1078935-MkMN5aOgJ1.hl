/*
 * 1. `@http.get` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "http.get" in the current context. It is often used to locate nodes related to HTTP GET requests or similar operations.
 *    
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "http.get" node. It is useful for accessing any additional data or metadata associated with the HTTP GET request.
 * 
 * 3. `content` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to find those with the name "content". This is typically used to access the main content or payload of the HTTP response.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "content" node. It is useful for accessing specific parts or elements of the content, such as headers, body, or other structured data.
 * 
 * 5. `fine_tuned_model` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to find those with the name "fine_tuned_model". It is used to access information specifically related to a fine-tuned model, such as its configuration, metadata, or results.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving and processing information about a fine-tuned model from an HTTP GET response, such as when integrating machine learning models into an application.
 * - Accessing specific details or metadata about a fine-tuned model for logging, monitoring, or further processing in a data pipeline.
