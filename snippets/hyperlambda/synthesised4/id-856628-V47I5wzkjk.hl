 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to execute an arbitrary SQL statement to create a database named "magic" using the [pgsql.execute] slot. The [pgsql.execute] slot allows for the execution of any SQL statement towards a PostgreSQL database, facilitating operations that are not covered by standard CRUD slots. This is particularly useful for database management tasks such as creating or altering databases and tables. The code snippet highlights the flexibility of the [pgsql.execute] slot in handling custom SQL commands for advanced database operations.
