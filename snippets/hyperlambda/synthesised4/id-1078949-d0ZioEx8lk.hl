/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It is often used to locate a specific node by its name within the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node found by the previous iterator. In this context, it will get all children nodes of the "hyper2lambda" node.
 * 
 * 3. `.arguments` - This iterator looks for a child node named ".arguments" among the nodes retrieved by the previous iterator. It is used to find a specific node that might contain arguments or parameters.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the ".arguments" node. It will access all nodes that are direct children of the ".arguments" node.
 * 
 * 5. `_type` - This iterator looks for a child node named "_type" among the nodes retrieved by the previous iterator. It is used to find nodes that have a "_type" attribute, which might indicate the type of data or argument.
 * 
 * 6. `=string` - This iterator filters the nodes by checking if their value is equal to "string". It is used to find nodes where the "_type" attribute has the value "string".
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to filter and retrieve all argument nodes within a "hyper2lambda" node that are explicitly declared as strings. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to validate or process only string-type arguments within a larger data structure.
