// // This Hyperlambda code pauses the execution of the current thread for 100 milliseconds. The [sleep] slot is used to introduce a delay in the execution flow, which can be useful in scenarios where a brief pause is necessary, such as waiting for a resource to become available or simulating processing time. The sleep operation is non-blocking, meaning it does not consume CPU resources while waiting, as the thread is released back to the operating system during the sleep period.
