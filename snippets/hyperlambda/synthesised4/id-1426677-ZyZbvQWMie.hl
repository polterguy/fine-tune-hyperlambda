/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to change the value of a node by replacing a substring within a URL. It uses the [set-value] slot to update the value of the [.type] node. The [strings.replace] slot is used to find and replace occurrences of "http://" in the URL with an empty string, effectively removing "http://" from the URL. This operation is performed on the URL provided in the [.arguments] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.type] node.
 * 2. [strings.replace] - Replaces "http://" with an empty string in the URL found in [.arguments/*/url].
