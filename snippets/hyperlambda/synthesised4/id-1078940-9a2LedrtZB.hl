/*
 * - `@.tmp-snippets`: This iterator starts by locating the first node named `.tmp-snippets` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name.
 * - `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.tmp-snippets` node. The `*` symbol is used to access all direct descendants of the node found in the previous step.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * 1. This expression could be used to gather all snippet nodes stored under a temporary node named `.tmp-snippets`, which might be useful for processing or displaying all temporary code snippets in a development environment.
 * 2. It could be used in a scenario where you need to iterate over all temporary data entries or configurations stored under a specific node for batch processing or cleanup tasks.
