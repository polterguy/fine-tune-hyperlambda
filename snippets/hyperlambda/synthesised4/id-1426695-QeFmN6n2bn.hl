/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sends a signal to a specific session using the [sockets.signal] slot. It transmits a message, which is derived from a JSON response, to all clients connected to the specified session. The message content is extracted using a lambda expression that navigates through the JSON structure to find the desired content within the response. The [args] node holds the message to be sent, ensuring that the correct data is transmitted to the session's subscribers. 
 * 
 * 1. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to a specific session.
 * 2. [args] - Holds the message to be transmitted.
 * 3. [message] - Extracts the content from a JSON response to be sent as a message.
