// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [auth.ticket.verify] slot to ensure that the currently authenticated user belongs to the "root" role. If the user does not have this role, an exception will be thrown. This is typically used in the context of securing an HTTP endpoint, ensuring that only users with the specified role can access the functionality provided by the endpoint.
