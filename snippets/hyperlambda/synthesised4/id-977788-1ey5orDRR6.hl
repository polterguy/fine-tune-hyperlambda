// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [and] slot to create a logical condition that checks if the value of the [userId] node within the [.arguments] node is equal to the value specified in the [id.eq] slot. The [and] slot ensures that all its child conditions must evaluate to true for the entire condition to be true. Here, it is used to compare the user ID argument against a specified value.
