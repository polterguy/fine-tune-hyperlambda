// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [cache.set] slot to store a message in the cache with a specific key, "session.message". The value "Welcome back, user!" is saved with an expiration time of 10 seconds, after which it will be automatically removed from the cache. This is useful for temporarily storing session-related messages or data.
cache.set:session.message
   expiration:10
   value:Welcome back, user!
