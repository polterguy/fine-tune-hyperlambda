// The code snippet uses the [else] slot to handle a condition where the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are not met. It concatenates the current node's value with the string " - needs restocking" using [strings.concat], and updates the node's value in place with [set-value]. The [else] block executes only if none of the previous conditions are true.
