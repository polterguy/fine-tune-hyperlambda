/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator looks for the first node with the name "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or an HTTP endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set, which in this case would be all children nodes of the "arguments" node. This is useful for accessing any argument nodes that might be passed into a slot or function.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "session". It is used to specifically access the "session" argument if it exists among the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda slot or HTTP endpoint to retrieve the value of a "session" argument passed into it. This might be useful in scenarios where session management is needed, such as maintaining user session data in a web application.
