// The code connects to an SQLite database and selects specific columns from the "questions" table. It specifies the columns to retrieve, such as question_id, question, questionnaire, type, context, and name. It also sets up a conditional clause using "where" with an "and" operator, indicating that multiple conditions can be added to filter the results.
