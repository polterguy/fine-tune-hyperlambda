/*
 * The Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement with multiple [case] slots and a [default] slot. It evaluates the value of the [.input] node and executes the corresponding [case] block if a match is found. If no match is found, the [default] block is executed. The code is useful for executing different code paths based on the value of a variable.
 * 
 * 1. [.input] - Declares a node with a value to be evaluated in the switch statement.
 * 2. [switch] - Initiates the switch statement to evaluate the [.input] node's value.
 * 3. [case] - Represents a possible value for the switch statement to match against the [.input] node's value.
 * 4. [log.info] - Logs a message indicating which case was matched.
 * 5. [default] - Executes if no [case] matches the [.input] node's value, logging a default message.
