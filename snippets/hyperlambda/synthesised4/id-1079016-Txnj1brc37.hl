/*
 * 1. `@.exe` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "exe" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It is often used to locate a specific node that serves as a parent or ancestor to the current node, allowing access to its children or value. This is useful when you need to perform operations or checks on nodes related to a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node, which in this case is the "exe" node. It allows you to access all direct descendants of the "exe" node, enabling operations or evaluations on multiple nodes at once.
 * 
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved node set to only include nodes with the name "signal". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes that match a specific name, which is useful when you are interested in processing or evaluating nodes with a particular role or meaning.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to monitor or manipulate signals related to a specific execution context, such as in a process management or event handling system.
 * - It might be useful in a logging or debugging context where you want to extract or analyze signal data associated with a particular execution node.
