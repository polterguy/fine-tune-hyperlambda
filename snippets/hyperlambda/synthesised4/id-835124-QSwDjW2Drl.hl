// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specific location in the node graph. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all child nodes of the [args] node within the [.arguments] node, and the [add] slot appends these nodes to the location specified by the [invoke] expression. This operation effectively transfers all child nodes of [args] to the target location defined by [invoke].
