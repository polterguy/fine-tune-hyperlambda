// This Hyperlambda code uses the [validators.default] slot to ensure that a node named [delay] exists within the [.arguments] node. If the [delay] node does not exist, it is created with a value derived from the expression [x:@signal/*/crawl-delay]. If the [delay] node exists but has a null value, its value is set to the result of the expression. This ensures that the [delay] node always has a valid value, either by creation or by updating a null value.
