// This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the value of the [.result] node to the value obtained from the [whitelist] node. It uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of [.result], and the [get-value] slot to retrieve the value from the [whitelist] node. The expression in [set-value] points to [.result], while [get-value] points to [whitelist].
