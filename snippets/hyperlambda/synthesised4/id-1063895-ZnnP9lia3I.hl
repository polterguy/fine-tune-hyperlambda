/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node, which is the next node in the sequence or the node below it in the Hyperlambda structure. It is useful for accessing the next node in a sequence when you need to evaluate or manipulate it relative to the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node set. It is commonly used to access all subordinate nodes of a parent node, allowing for operations or evaluations on multiple nodes that are hierarchically below the current node.
