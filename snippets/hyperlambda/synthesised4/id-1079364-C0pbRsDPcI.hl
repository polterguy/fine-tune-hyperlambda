/*
 * This expression is a simple Hyperlambda expression that uses a single iterator. Below is an explanation of the iterator used:
 * 
 * 1. `@.no`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "no" that is found in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to check if a node named "no" exists in the current context and retrieve its value. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to verify the presence of a specific node or access its value for further processing.
