// The code snippet demonstrates how to execute a specific workflow action using the [execute] slot. It calls the "magic.workflows.actions.execute" slot to run a workflow named "html-encode-subject" from the file "/misc/workflows/actions/misc/html-encode.hl". The workflow takes an argument named "html", which is dynamically retrieved from the "subject" node within the [.arguments] node.
execute:magic.workflows.actions.execute
   name:html-encode-subject
   filename:/misc/workflows/actions/misc/html-encode.hl
   arguments
      html:x:@.arguments/*/subject
