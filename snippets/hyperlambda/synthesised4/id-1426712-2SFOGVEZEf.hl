 * The Hyperlambda code uses the [openai.tokenize] slot to calculate the number of tokens required by the JSON representation of a lambda object. It first converts a lambda object into a JSON string using the [lambda2json] slot and then determines the token count for this JSON string. 
 * 
 * 1. [openai.tokenize] - Calculates the number of tokens required by the JSON representation of a lambda object.
 * 2. [lambda2json] - Converts a lambda object into a JSON string.
