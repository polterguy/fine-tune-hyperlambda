/*
 * 1. `-`: This iterator retrieves the younger sibling of the current node. It moves to the previous node or the node above it in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you need to access a node that is directly before the current node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `0`: This iterator retrieves the first child of the current node. It is used to access the first child node in a list of children nodes. This can be useful when you want to perform operations or retrieve values from the first child node specifically.
 * 
 * 3. `-`: This iterator, similar to the first one, retrieves the younger sibling of the current node. It moves to the previous node or the node above it in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you need to access a node that is directly before the current node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential Use Cases:
 * - This expression could be used to navigate to a specific node in a Hyperlambda structure by first moving to a sibling node, then accessing its first child, and finally moving to another sibling node. This might be useful in scenarios where the structure of the Hyperlambda is known, and specific nodes need to be accessed or modified in sequence.
