/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator looks for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each individual argument passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `stream`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `stream` among the children of `.arguments`. It is used to specifically access the `stream` argument if it exists.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to check if a `stream` argument has been provided, and to access its value for further processing, such as streaming data operations or handling file uploads.
