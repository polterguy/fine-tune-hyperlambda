/*
 * Changes the value of all nodes referenced by its main expression to a specified value. The slot takes a single source value, which can be a static value or derived from another slot. The destination expression can target multiple nodes, allowing for simultaneous updates. This slot is useful for modifying node values dynamically within a Hyperlambda graph.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node named ".foo" with no initial value.
 * 2. [.foo] - Declares another node named ".foo" with no initial value.
 * 3. [set-value] - Changes the value of all nodes referenced by its expression to "SUCCESS".
 * 4. [.:SUCCESS] - The static value "SUCCESS" to be assigned to the nodes.
