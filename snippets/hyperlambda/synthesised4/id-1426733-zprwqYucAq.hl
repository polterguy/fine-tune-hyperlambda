/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if there are no training snippets available by using the [get-count] slot to count the nodes under [.snippets]. If the count is zero, it sends a warning message through a socket signal to a specified feedback channel, indicating that no training snippets were found at the specified URL. After sending the message, it pauses execution for 100 milliseconds. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks a condition and executes its [.lambda] block if true.
 * 2. [eq] - Compares two values for equality.
 * 3. [get-count] - Returns the number of nodes under [.snippets].
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 5. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to a specified feedback channel.
 * 6. [args] - Contains arguments for the socket signal.
 * 7. [message] - The warning message to be sent.
 * 8. [type] - Specifies the type of message as a warning.
 * 9. [sleep] - Pauses execution for a specified duration (100 milliseconds).
