/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator searches for the first node named "result" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful for quickly accessing a specific node's value or properties when you know its name and it's located somewhere above the current node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the result of a computation or operation that was stored in a "result" node.
 * - Accessing a status or outcome value that is commonly stored in a node named "result" in various parts of the application.
