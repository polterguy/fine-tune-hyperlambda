// 1. `@.no`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "no" node it encounters. This is useful when you need to find a specific node in a parent or ancestor context, such as retrieving configuration settings or parameters defined higher up in the structure.
