// The code demonstrates how to use the [data.delete] slot to delete records from a SQLite database table named "menu_items". It specifies the database type as SQLite and uses a [where] clause with an [and] condition to filter which records should be deleted. The [where] clause allows for precise targeting of records based on specified conditions, ensuring only the intended records are removed.
