/*
 * 1. `@pdf2text` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "pdf2text" from the current context. It is used to locate a specific node within the hierarchy that is named "pdf2text". This is useful when you want to start processing or extracting information from a node that represents a PDF to text conversion process or result.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "pdf2text" node. It is used to access all the immediate children of the "pdf2text" node, which could represent different parts or sections of the converted text from the PDF. This is useful for iterating over or processing each section of the converted text individually.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting and processing text from a PDF document where the "pdf2text" node contains the conversion result, and the children nodes represent different sections or paragraphs of the text.
 * - Iterating over the converted text sections to perform further analysis, such as searching for specific keywords or patterns within the text.
