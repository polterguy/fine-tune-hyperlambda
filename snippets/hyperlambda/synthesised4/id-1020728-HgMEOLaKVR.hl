// 1. `@.final-message`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "final-message" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors and siblings. This is useful for accessing specific nodes that are not direct children of the current node, allowing you to retrieve values or nodes that are part of a broader context or hierarchy.
