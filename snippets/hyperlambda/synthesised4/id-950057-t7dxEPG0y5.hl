// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append a new node to the [results] node. It creates a new node with a [name] child node, which dynamically retrieves its value using the [get-name] slot, and a [status] child node with a static value of "needs restocking". The [add] slot facilitates the addition of structured data to an existing node set.
