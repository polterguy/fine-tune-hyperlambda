// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database, specifically from the "Customers" table. It specifies a list of columns to retrieve, including customer details like CustomerID, CompanyName, and ContactName. The [where] clause is set up for filtering the results based on specified conditions, although the actual conditions are not provided in this snippet. The [database-type] slot indicates the use of SQLite for this operation.
