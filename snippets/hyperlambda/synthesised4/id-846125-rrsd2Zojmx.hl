// The Hyperlambda code uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a signal to a specific session. It includes an [args] node with a child node [function_waiting] set to a boolean value of false. This setup is typically used to notify a specific session about a change or event, with the [args] node providing additional data in JSON format.
