// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [auth.ticket.verify] slot to ensure that the currently authenticated user belongs to either the "admin" or "basic" roles. If the user does not belong to any of these specified roles, an exception will be thrown, effectively preventing unauthorized access to the resource or endpoint. This is typically used in securing HTTP endpoints to enforce role-based access control.
