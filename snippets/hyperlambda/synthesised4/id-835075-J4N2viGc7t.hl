// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node is reached, allowing forward evaluation. In this example, [unwrap] is applied to the node's elder sibling, ensuring that any expressions are evaluated and their values are resolved before the node is processed. This is useful for dynamically determining values in a Hyperlambda graph.
