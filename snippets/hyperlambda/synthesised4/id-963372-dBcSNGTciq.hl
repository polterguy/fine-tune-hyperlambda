// This Hyperlambda code sets HTTP response headers to configure the response as a PDF file. It uses [response.headers.set] to specify the Content-Type as "application/pdf", indicating the response is a PDF document. The Content-Disposition header is dynamically set using [strings.concat], and Access-Control-Expose-Headers is set to "Content-Disposition" to expose this header to client-side scripts.
