 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It's typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It's useful for accessing all the parameters or data passed within the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `sys` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "sys" among the children of the "arguments" node. It's often used to access a specific parameter or piece of data labeled as "sys" within the arguments.
