// This Hyperlambda code uses the [case] slot to check for a condition where the value is "red". If the condition is met, it logs an informational message using [log.info] indicating that "red" was chosen. The [case] slot is typically used within a [switch] construct to handle different cases based on the value provided.
case:red
   log.info:You chose red!
