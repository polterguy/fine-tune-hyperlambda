// This Hyperlambda code uses the [pgsql.execute] slot to execute a PostgreSQL SQL statement that creates a table named "events" if it doesn't already exist. The table includes three columns: "id" as a serial primary key, "name" as a non-null text field, and "timestamp" with a default value of the current timestamp in UTC format.
pgsql.execute:@"
create table if not exists events (
  id serial primary key,
  name text not null,
  timestamp timestamptz default now()
)"
