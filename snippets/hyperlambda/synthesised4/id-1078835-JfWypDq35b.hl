/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by finding the first node named ".arguments" in the current context. It is used to locate the node that typically contains the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint. This is crucial in Hyperlambda when you need to access input parameters or arguments.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the ".arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed within the ".arguments" node, allowing further filtering or processing of these arguments.
 * 
 * 3. `system`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "system" among the children of the ".arguments" node. It is used to specifically access an argument named "system", which might be used to pass system-related configurations or parameters.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to access and process a specific argument named "system" from the input arguments. This could be useful in scenarios where the function needs to handle system-specific configurations or parameters, such as environment settings or system identifiers.
