/*
 * This Hyperlambda code defines a signal named "magic.ai.url.get" that retrieves a URL from the [.arguments] node using a lambda expression. It is designed to extract the URL specified in the "query" argument and perform an action with it. The code is likely part of a larger system where URLs need to be dynamically retrieved and processed based on incoming requests or parameters. 
 * 
 * 1. [signal] - Declares a new signal named "magic.ai.url.get".
 * 2. [url] - Retrieves the URL from the [.arguments] node using a lambda expression pointing to the "query" argument.
