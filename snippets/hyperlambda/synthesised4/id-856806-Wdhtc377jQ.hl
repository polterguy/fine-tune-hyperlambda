// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the "length" node that is a child of the node currently referenced by [.dp]. The [.dp] node is typically used in iterative constructs like [for-each] to represent the current node being processed. The [get-value] slot is used to extract the value of the "length" node, assuming it exists as a child of the node referenced by [.dp].
