// This Hyperlambda code calculates the total rewards by summing up the values from purchases, referrals, and promotions for each source under the rewards node. The [set-value] slot updates the total node with the result of the [math.add] operation, which aggregates the values retrieved by [get-value] from the specified nodes.
