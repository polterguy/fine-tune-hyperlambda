// The Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of a node by dynamically constructing its path using the values of [arg1] and [arg2]. The [get-value] slot is used to access the node's value, with the path being built from the parent node's children, incorporating the values of [arg1] and [arg2] to specify the exact node to retrieve.
