// The code snippet demonstrates how to update the value of a node by concatenating its current value with another value extracted from a JSON structure. The [set-value] slot is used to modify the [.result] node, while [strings.concat] combines the existing value of [.result] with the content extracted from a JSON message using [get-value]. This showcases the ability to dynamically update node values by combining existing data with new data extracted from a JSON structure.
set-value:x:@.result
   strings.concat
      get-value:x:@.result
