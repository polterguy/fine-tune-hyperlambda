/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by locating the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an HTTP endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument individually, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes with the name `session`. It is used to specifically access the `session` argument if it exists among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to retrieve the `session` argument passed to it, which might contain session-related information such as user authentication details or session identifiers.
 * - It could be used in a logging or debugging context to check if a `session` argument is present and to retrieve its value for further processing or validation.
