/*
 * 1. `@.no-invocation`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no-invocation" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. This is useful when you want to find a specific node in the hierarchy without considering sibling nodes. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - To check if a specific configuration or setting node exists in the ancestor chain.
 * - To retrieve a node that might affect the current node's processing logic, such as a flag or a status indicator.
