/*
 * 1. `@.meta`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node named "meta" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it looks for a node by name, and the `.` implies it starts from the current node's context.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the "meta" node. The `*` symbol is used to access all direct children nodes of the previously found node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access and manipulate metadata associated with a particular node, such as configuration settings or additional information stored as children of a "meta" node.
 * - It might be used in scenarios where you need to iterate over all metadata entries to perform operations like validation, transformation, or aggregation.
