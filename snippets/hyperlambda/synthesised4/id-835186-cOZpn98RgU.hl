// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [html2lambda] slot to convert an HTML string into a lambda object. The [html2lambda] slot takes an HTML string as input and transforms it into a structured lambda node representation, allowing for easy manipulation and traversal of HTML elements within the Hyperlambda environment. The resulting lambda object can then be used for further processing or conversion back to HTML.
