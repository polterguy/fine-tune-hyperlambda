/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you want to navigate upwards in the node hierarchy to access parent nodes.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is commonly used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing you to perform operations on each child node.
 * 
 * 3. `data.update` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "data.update". It is useful for narrowing down the node set to specific nodes of interest by name.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Similar to the second iterator, this retrieves all children nodes of the "data.update" nodes. It allows you to access all nodes that are direct descendants of "data.update".
 * 
 * 5. `values` - This iterator further filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "values". It is used to pinpoint specific nodes within the hierarchy that match the given name, allowing for precise data manipulation or retrieval.
