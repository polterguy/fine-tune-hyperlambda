// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a sequence of operations when previous conditions are not met. It lists all files in the "/etc/cache/" directory using [io.file.list], and then iterates over each file with [for-each], deleting each one with [io.file.delete]. This sequence effectively clears the cache directory if the [else] condition is triggered.
