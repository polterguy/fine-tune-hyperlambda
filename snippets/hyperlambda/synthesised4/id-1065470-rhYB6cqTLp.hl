// 1. `@.fields`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "fields" from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` symbol specifies that it starts the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by its name within the current scope, ensuring that you are working with the correct node in a potentially complex structure.
