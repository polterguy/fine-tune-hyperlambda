// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.update] slot to update records in a specified database table. The [table] slot specifies the target table, "roles" in this case. The [values] slot is intended to contain the columns and their new values to be updated. The [where] slot, combined with [and], is used to specify conditions that determine which records will be updated, ensuring that only specific records are affected by the update operation.
