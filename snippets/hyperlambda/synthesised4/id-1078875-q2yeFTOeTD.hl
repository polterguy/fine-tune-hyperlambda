/*
 * 1. `@strings.trim`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "strings.trim" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to find a node responsible for trimming strings, possibly to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string value.
 * - It might be part of a larger operation where string manipulation is necessary, such as formatting user input or preparing data for storage or display.
