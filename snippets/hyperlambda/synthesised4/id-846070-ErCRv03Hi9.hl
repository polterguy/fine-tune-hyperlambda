// The code snippet uses an [else] block to concatenate strings, including a trimmed version of a node's text content, and formats it within triple backticks for code representation. It then unwraps the concatenated result and adds it to a specific location in a node structure, under a [completion] node. The process involves trimming whitespace from text content and appending it to a predefined structure.
