/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type name of a node's value. The example initializes a node named [.foo] with an integer value of 57 and then uses the [type] slot to determine the type of the node's value. The result of the [type] invocation will be the type name of the [.foo] node's value, which is "int" in this case. 
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type name of the node's value.
