/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "arguments" node. It is used to access all the argument nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "session". It is used to specifically access the "session" argument node among the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve the "session" argument from a set of arguments passed to a slot or function, which could be useful in scenarios where session-specific data needs to be accessed or manipulated within a Hyperlambda execution context.
