/*
 * 1. `@.function-result`: This iterator searches for the first node named `function-result` that is either a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that the search is for a node by name, and the `.` symbol specifies that the search should start from the current node and include its siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you want to retrieve the result of a function that has been executed earlier in the node hierarchy and is stored in a node named `function-result`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the output of a previously executed function to use it in subsequent operations.
 * - Accessing a result node that is shared among multiple sibling nodes for further processing or validation.
