// The provided Hyperlambda code checks if a node named "content" exists as a child of the previous sibling of the current node, and if so, ensures that the "content" node's value is neither an empty string nor null. It uses the [and] slot to combine these conditions, [exists] to verify the presence of the "content" node, and [not] with [eq] to confirm the "content" node's value is not empty or null.
