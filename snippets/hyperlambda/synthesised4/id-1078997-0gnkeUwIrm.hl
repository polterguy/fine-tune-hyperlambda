/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node named ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This node is typically used in [for-each] loops to reference the currently iterated node.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is a reference to another node, and it retrieves this node by reference. This is useful for modifying the original node rather than a copy.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node found by the previous iterator. It is used to access the direct descendants of the de-referenced node.
 * 
 * 4. `Extra` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "Extra" among the children nodes retrieved by the `*` iterator. It effectively narrows down the search to nodes with this specific name.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access and manipulate or evaluate nodes named "Extra" that are children of a node referenced by the ".dp" node, which is typically the currently iterated node in a loop. This might be useful in processing data structures where certain operations need to be performed on specific nodes named "Extra".
