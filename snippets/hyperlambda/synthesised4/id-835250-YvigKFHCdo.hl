 * The code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to assign the value of the node referenced by the [get-value] slot to the [.tmp] node. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [.context] node, and this value is then set as the value of the [.tmp] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Assigns a value to the [.tmp] node.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [.context] node.
