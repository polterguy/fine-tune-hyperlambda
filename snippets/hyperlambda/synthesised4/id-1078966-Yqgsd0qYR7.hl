/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further navigation through the node structure.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. It allows for accessing any child node regardless of its name.
 * 3. `urls` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find the one named "urls". It is used to narrow down the search to a specific node of interest.
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "urls" node. It allows for accessing any child node under "urls" regardless of its name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to gather all URL nodes under a "signal" node, which might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or validate a list of URLs associated with a particular signal in a data structure.
 * - It could be used in a web scraping or data aggregation context where URLs need to be extracted and processed from a structured data format.
