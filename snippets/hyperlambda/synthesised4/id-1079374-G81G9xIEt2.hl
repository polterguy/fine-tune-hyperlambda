 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name from the current context. In this case, it looks for the first node named "fields" in the current node's hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to access a node named "fields" that contains a collection of data fields or attributes, perhaps in a data processing or form handling scenario.
