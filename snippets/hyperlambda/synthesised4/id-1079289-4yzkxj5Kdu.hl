/*
 * 1. `@.no`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "no" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first occurrence it finds. This is useful when you want to retrieve a specific node that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node, particularly when the node structure is complex and you need to access a node that is not a direct child.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to check or manipulate the value of a "no" node that is part of a larger decision-making process, such as toggling a feature off in a configuration setting.
