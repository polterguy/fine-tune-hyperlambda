 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node's siblings and ancestors. This is useful for retrieving a specific node that contains SQL-related information, such as a query or database connection details, within a larger Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to dynamically retrieve and execute SQL queries stored in a node named "sql" within a Hyperlambda script, allowing for flexible database operations based on the current context.
