// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a node set. It retrieves nodes specified by the [get-nodes] slot from the [.arguments] node, specifically the [limit] and [offset] nodes, and appends them to the node set referenced by [data.read]. The [add] slot is used to modify the structure of the node graph by adding new nodes to it.
