// This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if the value of the [referrer] node within the [.arguments] node is not equal to an empty string. The [neq] slot is used to perform the not equal comparison, and it will evaluate to true if the [referrer] node's value is not an empty string. The expression [x:@.arguments/*/referrer] is used to retrieve the value of the [referrer] node for comparison.
