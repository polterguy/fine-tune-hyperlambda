// This Hyperlambda code uses a [switch] statement to determine the type of a node's value and perform specific actions based on the type. It checks if the type is a numeric type (long, decimal, int, float, or double) and converts the value accordingly. If the type is "hyperlambda," it adds a converted Hyperlambda representation to the node. The [switch] statement evaluates the type of a node and executes the corresponding [case] block, modifying the node's value based on its type.
