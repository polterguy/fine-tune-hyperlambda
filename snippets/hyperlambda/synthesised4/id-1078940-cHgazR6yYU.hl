/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (the next node or the node below the current node in the Hyperlambda structure) of the current node. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate nodes that are at the same level but appear later in the sequence.
 * 
 * 2. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. In this context, it will get all children of the elder sibling node retrieved by the `+` iterator. This is useful for accessing or processing all subordinate nodes under a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `/snippets` - This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes that have the name "snippets". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes of interest, which in this case are nodes named "snippets".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting or processing all "snippets" nodes that are children of the elder sibling of the current node. This could be useful in scenarios where you are organizing code or content snippets and need to perform operations on them collectively.
 * - Navigating a structured document or configuration file to apply transformations or extract data from specific sections identified by their sibling relationships and node names.
