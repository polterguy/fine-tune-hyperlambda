// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.system-message] node by loading the content of a file. The [set-value] slot assigns the content retrieved by the [io.file.load] slot, which reads the file located at "/modules/fine-tune-hyperlambda/system-message-synthesiser.md". The [io.file.load] slot is used to load the file's content as text, which is then assigned to the [.system-message] node.
set-value:x:@.system-message
