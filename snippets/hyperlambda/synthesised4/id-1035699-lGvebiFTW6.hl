/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is useful for accessing the arguments passed to a function or a slot, as arguments are typically organized under a node named `.arguments`.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each individual argument node that is a child of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `username` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `username`. It is helpful for extracting the specific argument named `username` from the list of arguments, assuming such an argument exists.
