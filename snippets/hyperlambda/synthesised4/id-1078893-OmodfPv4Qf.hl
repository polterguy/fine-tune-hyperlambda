/*
 * 1. `@.lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named "lambda" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for locating a specific node within a nested structure where the node name is known.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "lambda" node found in the previous step. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "lambda" node, which might contain various elements or configurations related to the "lambda" node.
 * 
 * 3. `lambda2hyper` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "lambda2hyper" among the children of the "lambda" node. It is useful for narrowing down the search to specific nodes of interest, especially when multiple types of nodes exist at the same level.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "lambda2hyper" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "lambda2hyper" node, which might contain further nested configurations or data.
 * 
 * 5. `last_log_items` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "last_log_items" among the children of the "lambda2hyper" node. This is useful for accessing specific data or configurations related to logging or recent activities, assuming "last_log_items" contains such information.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a logging system to retrieve the most recent log entries or configurations related to logging within a specific "lambda" context.
 * - It might be used in a system that processes or transforms lambda expressions, where "lambda2hyper" represents a transformation step and "last_log_items" holds the results or logs of the transformation.
