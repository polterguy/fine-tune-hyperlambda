// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [default] slot within a [switch] block to handle cases where no matching [case] node is found. If none of the [case] nodes match the evaluated value of the [switch], the [default] node is executed, setting the value of the [.switch-content] node to "Unknown environment" using the [set-value] slot.
