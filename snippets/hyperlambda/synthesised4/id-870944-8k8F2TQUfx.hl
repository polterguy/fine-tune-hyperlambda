// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve all child nodes of a specified node. The expression [x:@.cur/*] points to all children of the [.cur] node, and [get-nodes] returns these nodes as a collection. This is useful for accessing and manipulating multiple nodes within a specific parent node in a Hyperlambda graph.
get-nodes:x:@.cur/*
