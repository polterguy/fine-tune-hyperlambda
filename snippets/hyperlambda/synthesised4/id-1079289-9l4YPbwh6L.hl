/*
 * This expression is used to navigate a Hyperlambda node structure and retrieve specific nodes based on the criteria specified by each iterator. Below is a breakdown of each iterator in the expression `.:x:@.fields/*`:
 * 
 * 1. `@.fields`: This iterator searches for the first node named "fields" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node itself and its siblings, until it finds a node with the name "fields". This is useful for accessing a specific section of a Hyperlambda graph where a node named "fields" is expected to exist.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all the children of the node found by the previous iterator. In this context, it means that once the "fields" node is located, all of its direct child nodes will be selected. This is useful for iterating over or processing all elements within a "fields" node, which might represent a collection of field definitions or data items.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * - Extracting all field definitions from a data structure where "fields" is a parent node containing individual field nodes.
 * - Iterating over a list of fields to perform operations such as validation, transformation, or aggregation on each field.
