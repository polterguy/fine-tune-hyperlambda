/*
 * 1. `@data.read` - This iterator searches for the first node named `data.read` in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further traversal within the node structure. A potential use case is to begin processing data from a specific data source or operation result.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the `data.read` node. It is useful for accessing all immediate sub-nodes under the `data.read` node, which might represent different data fields or elements.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children of each child node found in the previous step. This allows for deeper traversal into the node structure, potentially accessing nested data elements or properties.
 * 
 * 4. `completion` - This iterator filters the results to only include nodes named `completion`. It is used to extract specific data elements named `completion` from the nested structure. A potential use case is to gather completion data from a series of operations or tasks represented in the node structure.
