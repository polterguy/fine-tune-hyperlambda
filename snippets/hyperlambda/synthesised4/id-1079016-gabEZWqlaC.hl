/*
 * 1. `@http.post`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "http.post" in the current context. It starts from the root node of the current Hyperlambda execution context and traverses through the node hierarchy to find the specified node. This is useful for locating a specific node that represents an HTTP POST request configuration or handler within a larger Hyperlambda structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the configuration or parameters of an HTTP POST request within a Hyperlambda script.
 * - Accessing the details of an HTTP POST operation to modify or utilize its data in subsequent operations.
