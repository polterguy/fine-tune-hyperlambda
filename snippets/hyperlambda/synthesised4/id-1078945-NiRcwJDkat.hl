/*
 * 1. `@.lambda`: This iterator searches for the first node named ".lambda" in the current context. It is useful for locating a specific node by name within the current hierarchy, especially when the node is expected to be unique or the first of its kind.
 * 
 * 2. `@.lambda`: This iterator again searches for the first node named ".lambda" in the context of the previous result set. It is used here to further narrow down the search within the children of the previously found ".lambda" node.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found ".lambda" node. It is useful for accessing all direct descendants of a node, allowing for operations or further filtering on multiple nodes at once.
 * 
 * 4. `http.post`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "http.post". It is useful for locating specific nodes related to HTTP POST operations, which might contain configurations or data for such requests.
 * 
 * 5. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "http.post" node. It allows for accessing all elements or configurations related to the HTTP POST operation.
 * 
 * 6. `payload`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "payload". It is typically used to locate the data or content that is intended to be sent in the body of an HTTP POST request.
 * 
 * 7. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "payload" node. It is useful for accessing individual elements or data points within the payload, which might be structured or contain multiple parts.
 * 
 * 8. `max_tokens`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "max_tokens". It is often used in contexts where there is a need to specify or retrieve a limit on the number of tokens, such as in API requests to language models.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include configuring or retrieving the maximum number of tokens allowed in a payload for an HTTP POST request, particularly in applications interacting with language models or APIs that require token limits.
