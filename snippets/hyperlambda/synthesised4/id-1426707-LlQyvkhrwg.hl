/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [prompt] exists within the [.arguments] node. If it does not exist, it adds a new node named [prompt] with the value "prompt" to the [.arguments] node. The code uses the [if] slot to evaluate the condition and the [not-exists] slot to check for the absence of the [prompt] node. If the condition is true, the [.lambda] block is executed, which uses the [add] slot to add the [prompt] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Evaluates a condition and executes its [.lambda] block if the condition is true.
 * 2. [not-exists] - Checks if a node named [prompt] does not exist within the [.arguments] node.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the code to be executed if the [if] condition is true.
 * 4. [add] - Adds a new node to the [.arguments] node.
 * 5. [prompt] - The name of the node to be added if it does not already exist.
