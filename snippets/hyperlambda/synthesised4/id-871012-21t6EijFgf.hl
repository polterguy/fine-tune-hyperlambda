// This Hyperlambda code uses an [if] statement to check if a specific node does not exist within a given path. If the [not-exists] condition is true, indicating the absence of the node, it executes a lambda object that removes nodes at a specified path using [remove-nodes]. The logic ensures that nodes are only removed if the specified condition is met, demonstrating conditional execution based on node existence.
