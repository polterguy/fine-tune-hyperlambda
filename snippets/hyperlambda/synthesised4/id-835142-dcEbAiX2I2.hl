// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node is reached, allowing forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, it evaluates the expression pointing to the next node, ensuring the [.dest] node gets the value "Hello World" before being processed. This is useful for pre-evaluating expressions in lambda objects.
