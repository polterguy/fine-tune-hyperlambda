/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by locating the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It uses the `@` symbol to search for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for accessing argument nodes in a structured Hyperlambda graph, often used to retrieve input parameters for a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. The asterisk `*` is a wildcard that selects all direct children, allowing you to access any parameters or settings defined under the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `databaseType`: This iterator filters the previously selected children nodes to find the first node with the name "databaseType". It is used to specifically target a node that holds information about the type of database being referenced, which could be crucial for operations that depend on database-specific logic or configurations.
