// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database named "logistics_core" and reads 5 records from the "shipments" table. It then adds these records to a node named "shipment-records" by retrieving all nodes from the data read operation. The [data.connect] slot establishes the connection, [data.read] specifies the table and limit, and [add] along with [get-nodes] appends the retrieved records to "shipment-records".
