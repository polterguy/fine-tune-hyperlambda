// The code demonstrates a conditional check using the [if] slot to evaluate whether the value of the [foo] node under [.arguments] is true. If the condition is met, it executes the [log.info] slot to log the message "Condition is true". The [eq] slot is used to compare the value of [foo] to true, and the [.lambda] node contains the code to execute if the condition is satisfied.
