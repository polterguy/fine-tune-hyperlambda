// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator searches for the first node named "sql" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It returns the first "sql" node it encounters. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate a specific node that is expected to be an ancestor of the current node, such as retrieving a SQL query or command that is defined higher up in the structure.
