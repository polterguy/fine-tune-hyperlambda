// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to insert a record into a database table named "questions" using the [data.create] slot. It specifies the table and the values to be inserted, with the [values] node containing two fields: "questionnaire" and "question". The values for these fields are dynamically retrieved using lambda expressions, with "questionnaire" obtaining its value from the [.arguments] node's "name" child, and "question" obtaining its value from the [.question] node. This approach helps prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries.
data.create
   table:questions
   values
      questionnaire:x:@.arguments/*/name
      question:x:@.question
