/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator searches for the first node named "result" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first matching node it encounters. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located at a higher level in the node structure, such as retrieving a result value from a computation or operation that was stored in a parent node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have multiple computations or operations, and you want to access the result of a specific operation that is stored in a parent node named "result".
