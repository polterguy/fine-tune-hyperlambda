/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specified location in the Hyperlambda structure. It retrieves nodes using the [get-nodes] slot, which points to all children of the [.arguments] node, and appends them to the [signal] node. This effectively transfers all argument nodes to the [signal] node's children.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified location.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes referenced by the expression.
 * 3. [@.arguments/*] - Expression pointing to all children of the [.arguments] node.
