/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator looks for the first node named [arguments] in the current context. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [arguments] node. This is useful for accessing all the arguments provided to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `max_function_invocations` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [max_function_invocations]. This is used to specifically access the [max_function_invocations] argument, which might be used to limit the number of times a function can be invoked.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include scenarios where you need to enforce a limit on the number of times a function can be called, such as in rate limiting or resource management within a Hyperlambda application.
