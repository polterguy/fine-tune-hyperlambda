// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a database table named "Product" using a [data.read] operation. It applies a filtering condition using the [where] clause to select only those records where the "CategoryID" matches a specific value. The value for "CategoryID" is dynamically retrieved from a node structure, specifically from the currently iterated node's "CategoryID" field, as indicated by the expression `x:@.dp/#/*/CategoryID`. This expression de-references the value of the "CategoryID" node from the current data point in a loop or iteration context. After retrieving the desired records, the [yield] slot is used to return the result set, labeled as "products," which contains all the nodes retrieved by the [data.read] operation. This structure is useful for filtering and returning specific product data based on dynamic criteria, such as in a scenario where you need to display products belonging to a particular category in a web application or report.
data.read
   table:Product
   where
      and
         CategoryID.eq:x:@.dp/#/*/CategoryID
yield
   products:x:@data.read/*
