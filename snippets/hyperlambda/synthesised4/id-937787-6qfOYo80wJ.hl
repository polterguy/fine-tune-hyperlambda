// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to update records in a database table named "clusters" using the [data.update] slot. The [table] slot specifies the target table, while the [values] slot is intended to contain the columns and their new values to be updated. The [where] slot, combined with the [and] condition, is used to specify the criteria for selecting which records to update, ensuring that only records meeting certain conditions are modified.
