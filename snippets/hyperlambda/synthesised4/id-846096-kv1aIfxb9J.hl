// This code snippet updates the value of the [.result] node by replacing occurrences of a placeholder string "[[position]]" with a value. It uses [strings.replace] to perform the replacement, where the placeholder is replaced by the first non-null value obtained from [get-first-value]. This value is either retrieved from the [.position] argument or defaults to "right" if the argument is not provided.
