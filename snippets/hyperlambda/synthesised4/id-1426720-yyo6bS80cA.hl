/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type of a node's value. It first defines a node [.foo] with an integer value of 57, and then uses the [type] slot to retrieve the type of the node above it. The [type] slot returns the type name of the value, which in this case is "int". 
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type of the node above it, which is "int".
