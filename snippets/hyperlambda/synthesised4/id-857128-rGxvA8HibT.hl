// The code demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Orders" and "Shippers", using Hyperlambda. It specifies the join type as "left" and uses the alias "ShipVia" for the "Shippers" table. The join condition is defined using an "and" clause that matches the "ShipVia" column from the "Orders" table with the "ShipperID" column from the "Shippers" table.
join:Shippers

   type:left

      and
