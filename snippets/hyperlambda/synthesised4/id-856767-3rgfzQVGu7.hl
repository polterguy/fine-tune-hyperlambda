// The code snippet adds a new node named [return] as a sibling to the current node's parent, containing two child nodes: [context] and [snippets]. The [context] node retrieves its value from the current [context] node, while [snippets] is simply added as a child node under [return]. This operation effectively creates a [return] node structure with specific children, allowing for organized data representation or manipulation within a Hyperlambda graph.
