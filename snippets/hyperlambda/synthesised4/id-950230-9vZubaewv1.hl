// The code snippet demonstrates the use of a [case] slot with an integer value of 401, followed by a [throw] slot that raises an exception with the message "401 Unauthorized – You must log in to submit feedback". This pattern is typically used to handle specific cases, such as HTTP status codes, where an unauthorized access attempt is detected, prompting the system to throw an exception with a relevant error message.
case:int:401
   throw:401 Unauthorized – You must log in to submit feedback
