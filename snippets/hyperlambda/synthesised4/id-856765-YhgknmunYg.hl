// The [case] slot is used within a [switch] statement to define a specific condition or value to match against. When a [switch] statement is executed, it evaluates its expression and compares it against each [case] value. If a match is found, the corresponding block of code under the [case] is executed. This allows for branching logic based on multiple potential values or conditions.
