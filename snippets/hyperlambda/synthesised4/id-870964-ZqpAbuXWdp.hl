// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the value of a node located at [.lambda/@.lambda/*/signal/*/model_size] by converting the value of another node [.tokens] to an integer. The [set-value] slot is used to assign the converted integer value to the specified node, while the [convert] slot is responsible for the type conversion from its original type to an integer.
set-value:x:@.lambda/@.lambda/*/signal/*/model_size
