/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator searches for the first node named ".dp" in the current context. It is typically used to access a specific node that is expected to exist within the current execution scope. In many Hyperlambda contexts, ".dp" is used to refer to a data point or a node passed by reference within a loop or a function.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. In this context, it assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is another node itself, allowing for direct manipulation or traversal of that node's children.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node that was de-referenced by the `#` iterator. It is used to access all immediate child nodes of the ".dp" node's value.
 * 
 * 4. `prompt` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "prompt" from the children nodes retrieved by the `*` iterator. It is used to specifically target nodes with the name "prompt" for further operations or evaluations.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a loop or function where ".dp" is a reference to a node containing various data points, and the goal is to specifically extract or manipulate nodes named "prompt" within that data structure.
 * - It might be used in a context where prompts are dynamically generated or processed, such as in a chatbot or automated response system, where each ".dp" node represents a different conversation or interaction.
