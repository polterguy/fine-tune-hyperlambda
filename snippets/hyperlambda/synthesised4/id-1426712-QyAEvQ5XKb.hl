// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot in Hyperlambda to retrieve the type name of a node's value. In this example, a node named [.foo] is declared with an integer type and a value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to get the type name of the value of the [.foo] node. After executing the [type] slot, it will return "int" as the type name of the value.
type:int
