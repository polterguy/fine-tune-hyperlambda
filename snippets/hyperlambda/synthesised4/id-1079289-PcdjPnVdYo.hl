// 1. `@.no` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the ancestors and siblings to find a match. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node that is not a direct child or descendant of the current node, but rather an ancestor or elder sibling node. A potential use case could be to retrieve configuration settings or values defined at a higher level in the hierarchy, allowing for context-aware processing or decision-making based on those values.
