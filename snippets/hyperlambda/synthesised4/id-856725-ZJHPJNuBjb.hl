// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate a lambda expression that targets a specific node path. This expression retrieves all [.type] nodes within [.lambda] nodes, which are children of any node, and evaluates them before the execution reaches the [.type] node. This allows for forward evaluation of expressions within the lambda object.
