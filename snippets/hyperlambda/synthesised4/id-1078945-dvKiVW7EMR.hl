/*
 * 1. `@.iterations`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "iterations" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It looks for a sibling or ancestor node named "iterations" and returns it. This is useful when you need to reference a node that is defined earlier in the structure, such as when you want to use a previously defined parameter or configuration setting. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: You might use this expression in a loop or iterative process where "iterations" represents the number of times a loop should execute, allowing you to dynamically adjust the loop's behavior based on this parameter.
