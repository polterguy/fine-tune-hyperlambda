// The code demonstrates the use of the [eval] slot to execute a lambda object. It references a node named [.eval] and executes its children nodes sequentially. The [eval] slot is crucial in Hyperlambda as it allows the execution of specified lambda objects, either directly as children or through expressions leading to nodes. This example highlights the flexibility of [eval] in executing lambda objects dynamically.
