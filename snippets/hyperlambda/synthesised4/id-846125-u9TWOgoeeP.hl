// The code uses an [and] logical operation to evaluate two conditions: it checks if the string contained in [.result] includes the substring "FUNCTION_INVOCATION[" using [strings.contains], and verifies that the value of [.has-sent-waiting] is not equal to true using [neq]. Both conditions must be true for the [and] operation to evaluate to true.
