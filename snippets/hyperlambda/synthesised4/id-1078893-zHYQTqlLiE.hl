 * 1. `@.default-timezone`: This iterator searches for the first node named "default-timezone" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that the search is for a node by name, starting from the current node and looking through its siblings and children. This is useful for retrieving configuration settings or default values that are stored in a node named "default-timezone". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the default timezone setting in an application to display or use in time-related calculations.
 * - Accessing configuration data to adjust application behavior based on the timezone setting.
