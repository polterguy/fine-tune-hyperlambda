/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and it will return the first match it finds. This is useful for accessing a specific node that is expected to be present in the current scope.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is another node itself, allowing you to work with the node referenced by the value of ".dp" directly. This is useful when you need to manipulate or access the contents of a node that is stored as a value in another node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous step. It is used to access the immediate children of the node that was de-referenced in the previous step. This is useful when you want to iterate over or examine all direct children of a particular node.
 * 
 * 4. `status` - This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to only include nodes with the name "status". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes that specifically have the name "status" among the children of the node obtained in the previous step. This is useful for focusing on nodes with a specific purpose or meaning, such as status indicators or flags.
