/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda`: This iterator searches for the first node named "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy to find the first occurrence of a node with this name. This is useful when you want to target a specific node by name within a complex structure.
 * 
 * 2. `**`: This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the node found by the previous iterator, including the node itself. It uses a "breadth-first" algorithm to gather all nodes under the specified node. This is particularly useful when you need to perform operations on an entire subtree of nodes, such as collecting data from all child nodes or applying transformations to them.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression could include gathering all configuration settings under a specific node or aggregating data from a complex hierarchical structure for reporting or processing.
