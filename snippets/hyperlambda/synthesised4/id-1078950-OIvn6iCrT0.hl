/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node, which is the next node below the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. It is used to navigate to the next sibling node in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the node immediately following the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. After moving to the elder sibling node with the `+` iterator, this retrieves all of its children nodes. This is useful for accessing or processing all child nodes of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `/*` - This iterator again retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. After retrieving the children of the elder sibling node, this further drills down to get all children of those nodes. This is useful for accessing deeper levels of the node hierarchy, potentially to gather or manipulate data at a more granular level.
 * 
 * 4. `/context` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "context". After retrieving all children nodes at two levels deep from the elder sibling, this focuses on nodes specifically named "context". This is useful when you are interested in nodes that contain specific contextual information or metadata.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to gather or process contextual information from a specific part of a node hierarchy, such as retrieving configuration or metadata nodes that are nested within a specific sibling structure.
