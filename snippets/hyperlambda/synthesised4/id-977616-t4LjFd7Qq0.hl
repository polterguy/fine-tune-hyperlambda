/*
 * The code demonstrates how to perform an inner join between two tables, `table1` and `table2`, using the `sql.read` slot. The join condition is specified using the `on` clause, which ensures that the `id` column in `table1` is equal to the `ref_id` column in `table2`. The `type` argument specifies that the join is an inner join, meaning only matching rows from both tables will be included in the result.
 * 
 * 1. [join] - Initiates a join operation with the specified table.
 * 2. [type] - Specifies the type of join, in this case, an inner join.
 * 3. [on] - Defines the condition for the join operation.
 * 4. [and] - Combines multiple conditions for the join.
 * 5. [table1.id.eq:table2.ref_id] - Specifies the equality condition between the `id` column of `table1` and the `ref_id` column of `table2`.
