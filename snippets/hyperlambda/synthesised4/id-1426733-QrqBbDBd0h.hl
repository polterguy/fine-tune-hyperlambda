/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type name of a node's value. The [type] slot is used to determine and return the Hyperlambda type of a specified value. In this example, the [type] slot is invoked on a node with an integer value, and it will return "int" as the type name.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - A node with an integer type and value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - A slot that returns the Hyperlambda type name of the value of the node it references.
