/*
 * 1. `@.session` - This iterator looks for the first node named "session" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upward through the hierarchy, including siblings, to find the node named "session".
 * 
 * 2. `**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the "session" node, including the node itself. It uses a "breadth-first" search algorithm, meaning it will explore all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
 * 
 * 3. `role` - This iterator filters the results from the previous step to include only nodes named "role". It will return all nodes named "role" that are descendants of the "session" node.
 * 
 * 4. `=system` - This iterator filters the "role" nodes to include only those with a value of "system". It ensures that only nodes where the value is exactly "system" are returned.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to check if there are any roles with the value "system" within a session, which might be useful for determining if a user has system-level permissions.
 * - It could also be used in logging or auditing processes to verify which sessions have system roles assigned to them.
