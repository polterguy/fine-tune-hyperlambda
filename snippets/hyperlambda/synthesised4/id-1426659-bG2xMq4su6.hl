// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and assign the value of a node before it is reached by the Hyperlambda instruction pointer. It effectively "unwraps" the expression, allowing the node's value to be determined in advance. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions in lambda objects. The expression `x:+/*/*` is evaluated, and its result is assigned to the node where [unwrap] is used.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
