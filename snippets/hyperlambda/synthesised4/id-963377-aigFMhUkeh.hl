// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [yield] slot to return the result of an [odbc.scalar] operation. The [odbc.scalar] slot executes an SQL statement and returns a single scalar value, which in this case is labeled as "employee-count". The [yield] slot ensures that this value is returned to the caller, allowing further use or processing of the "employee-count" result.
yield
   employee-count:x:@odbc.scalar
