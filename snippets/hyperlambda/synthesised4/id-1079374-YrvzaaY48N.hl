/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node "before" in its hierarchy that matches the given name. In this case, it looks for the first ancestor node with the name "no". This is useful when you want to access a specific node that is not a direct parent or child but is somewhere up in the hierarchy, allowing you to traverse upwards and find nodes by name.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to check or manipulate data from a specific ancestor node named "no" within a complex hierarchical structure, such as configuration settings or nested data structures, ensuring you can access necessary information regardless of the current node's position in the hierarchy.
