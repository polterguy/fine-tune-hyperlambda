 * The code adds a new node structure under the [candidates] node, which is a child of [return]. Each new node contains a [name], [expression], and [complete] node. The [name] and [expression] nodes are set to the value of the [x] node, while [complete] is set to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node structure to the specified location.
 * 2. [name] - Sets the name of the new node to the value of [x].
 * 3. [expression] - Sets the expression of the new node to the value of [x].
 * 4. [complete] - Sets the complete status to true.
