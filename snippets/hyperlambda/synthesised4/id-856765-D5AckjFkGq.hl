// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot, which is part of a switch-case construct. It allows you to execute different code blocks based on the value of a given expression. Each [case] node specifies a value to match against, and if the expression matches this value, the corresponding code block is executed. This is useful for handling multiple conditions with different outcomes in a structured manner.
