/*
 * 1. `@http` - This iterator searches for the first node named "http" in the current context. It is used to locate the node that represents HTTP-related operations or configurations.
 * 
 * 2. `.post` - This iterator retrieves the child node named "post" of the previously found "http" node. It is used to access the configuration or data related to HTTP POST requests.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used to access and manipulate the configuration or data related to HTTP POST requests within a Hyperlambda script.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically adjust or retrieve information about HTTP POST operations, such as modifying headers, payloads, or endpoints.
