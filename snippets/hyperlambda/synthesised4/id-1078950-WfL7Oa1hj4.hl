/*
 * 1. `@math.subtract`: This iterator searches for the first node named "math.subtract" in the current context. It will traverse the hierarchy starting from the current node, moving upwards and across siblings, until it finds a node with the specified name. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to locate and reference a node where a subtraction operation is defined or executed, allowing you to retrieve or manipulate the result of that operation.
 * - It could be used in a scenario where you need to dynamically adjust or evaluate the result of a subtraction operation within a larger computation or workflow.
