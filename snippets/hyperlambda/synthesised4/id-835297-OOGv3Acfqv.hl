// The code uses the [strings.regex-replace] slot to remove specific patterns from a string. It targets the value of a node referenced by an expression and replaces occurrences of a pattern defined by a regular expression with an empty string. This effectively removes the matched patterns from the original string. The regular expression used here is "\\([0-9,]+\\)", which matches sequences of digits and commas enclosed in parentheses.
