/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `stream` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes that have the name "stream". It is used to specifically access the "stream" argument if it exists among the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function or slot to retrieve the value of an argument named "stream" that is passed to it. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to process or manipulate a data stream provided as an argument to your function.
