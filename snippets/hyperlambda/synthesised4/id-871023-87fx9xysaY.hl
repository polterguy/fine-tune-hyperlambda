/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if an HTTP GET request's response does not contain a "Content-Type" header or if it does not start with "text/html". If either condition is true, it logs an error message and throws an exception. The error log includes the URL and the actual "Content-Type" received, and a concatenated error message is created to describe the issue. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Begins a conditional block to evaluate the following conditions.
 * 2. [or] - Logical OR to check if either of the conditions is true.
 * 3. [not-exists] - Checks if the "Content-Type" header does not exist in the HTTP response.
 * 4. [not] - Negates the following condition.
 * 5. [strings.starts-with] - Checks if the "Content-Type" does not start with "text/html".
 * 6. [.lambda] - Executes the following code block if the condition is true.
 * 7. [log.error] - Logs an error message with the URL and "Content-Type".
 * 8. [strings.concat] - Concatenates strings to create a detailed error message.
 * 9. [throw] - Throws an exception with the concatenated error message.
