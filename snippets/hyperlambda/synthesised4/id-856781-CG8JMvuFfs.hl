// The Hyperlambda code checks the value obtained from the [get-value] slot using the [if] slot. If the value evaluates to true, it executes the [.lambda] block, which sets the [.allowed] node's value to true. The [if] slot is used for conditional execution based on the result of the [get-value] slot.
