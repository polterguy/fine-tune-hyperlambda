// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node referenced by the expression [@.dp/#] to "classified". The [set-value] slot modifies the value of the node it points to, and the [#] iterator is used to dereference the value of the [.dp] node, allowing direct modification of the original node.
set-value:x:@.dp/#
