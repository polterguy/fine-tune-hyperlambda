/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" from its current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node named "session". This is useful when you need to access session-related data or configurations that are stored in a node named "session" within the current execution context. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing session variables or configurations in a web application to retrieve user-specific data.
 * - Retrieving session state information in a workflow or process to make decisions based on the current session's state.
