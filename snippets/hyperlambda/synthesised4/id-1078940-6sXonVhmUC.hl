/*
 * 1. `@.file-data`: This iterator starts by locating the first node named `.file-data` in the current context. It uses the `@` symbol to search for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards and sideways (siblings) in the hierarchy until it finds the first match. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might not be a direct child of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: Once the `.file-data` node is located, the `*` iterator retrieves all of its children nodes. This is useful for iterating over or processing all child nodes of a specific parent node, such as when you need to perform operations on each piece of data contained within a `.file-data` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to process or analyze all data entries within a `.file-data` node, such as reading file metadata or processing a list of file records.
 * - It could also be used in a data transformation task where each child node of `.file-data` represents a piece of data that needs to be transformed or validated.
