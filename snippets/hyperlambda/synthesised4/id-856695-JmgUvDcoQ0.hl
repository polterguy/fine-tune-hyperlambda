// This Hyperlambda code uses the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes into multiple destination nodes specified by the expression "../*/return/*/candidates". Each appended node contains three children: [name], [expression], and [complete], where [name] and [expression] are set to the value of the node referenced by "@.x", and [complete] is a boolean set to true. This operation effectively adds structured data into the specified destination nodes.
