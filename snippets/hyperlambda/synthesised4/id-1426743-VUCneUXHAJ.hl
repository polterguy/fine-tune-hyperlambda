/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [strings.replace-not-of] slot to replace every character in the string pointed to by the expression [x:@.dp/#] that is not a digit or a period with an empty string, effectively removing all non-numeric and non-period characters from the string. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.replace-not-of] - This slot is used to replace characters in a string that are not found in the specified set of characters.
 * 2. [x:@.dp/#] - An expression pointing to the value of the [.dp] node, which is the string to be processed.
 * 3. [.:0123456789.] - The set of characters to retain in the string, which includes digits and a period.
 * 4. [.:] - The replacement string, which is an empty string in this case, used to replace characters not in the specified set.
