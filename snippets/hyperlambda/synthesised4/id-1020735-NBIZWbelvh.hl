// 1. `-`: This iterator retrieves the previous result set's younger sibling, which is the node directly above it in the Hyperlambda structure. It is used when you want to access or manipulate the node that is immediately before the current node in the sequence. This can be useful in scenarios where the order of nodes is significant, and you need to perform operations relative to the position of nodes in the Hyperlambda graph.
