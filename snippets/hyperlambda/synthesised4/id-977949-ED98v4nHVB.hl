// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the node referenced by [.dp] is more than or equal to 10 using the [mte] slot. If the condition is true, it increments the value of the [.count] node by 1 using the [math.increment] slot. The [if] slot is used to conditionally execute the increment operation based on the comparison result.
