// This Hyperlambda code snippet trims the value of the [completion] node for each node in the current context, removing any leading or trailing whitespace characters. It uses the [set-value] slot to update the value of the [completion] node with the result of the [strings.trim] operation. The [strings.trim] slot is applied to the current [completion] node, ensuring that the node's value is cleaned of any unnecessary whitespace. The [set-value] slot then assigns this trimmed value back to the [completion] node.
