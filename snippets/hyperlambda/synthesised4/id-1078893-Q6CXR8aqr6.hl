/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used twice in succession here, which means it will go up two levels in the hierarchy from the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. After moving up two levels, it will gather all the children nodes at that level.
 * 
 * 3. `lambda2hyper` - This iterator filters the results to only include nodes with the name "lambda2hyper" from the previously retrieved set of nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to find and operate on all nodes named "lambda2hyper" that are two levels up from the current node in a Hyperlambda structure. This might be useful in a scenario where you need to apply a transformation or extract information from specific nodes that are part of a larger hierarchical configuration.
