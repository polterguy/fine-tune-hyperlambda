// The code changes the name of a node to a concatenated string. It uses [set-name] to modify the name of a node referenced by its expression. The new name is constructed using [strings.concat], which combines a static string value and the value retrieved by [get-value]. The [strings.concat] slot concatenates the specified string and the value obtained from the expression, resulting in a new name for the node.
