/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda) of its previous result set. It is used to navigate to the next sibling node in the hierarchy.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all immediate child nodes of a node.
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the result set obtained from the previous `*` iterator. It is used to access the grandchildren nodes of the node obtained from the elder sibling.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to navigate from a node to its elder sibling, and then retrieve all grandchildren nodes of that sibling. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze data that is structured in a hierarchical manner, and you are interested in the grandchildren of a specific sibling node.
