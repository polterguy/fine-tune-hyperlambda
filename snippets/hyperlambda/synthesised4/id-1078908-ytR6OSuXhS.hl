/*
 * The expression `@math.add` is a lambda expression that uses a single iterator to reference a node within the current Hyperlambda graph. Below is a detailed explanation of the iterator used in this expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@math.add`: This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "math.add" in the current scope of the Hyperlambda graph. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by its name. This is useful when you need to access the result or configuration of a previously executed [math.add] operation, which might have been used to perform an addition of numbers or values in the graph.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing the result of a mathematical addition operation performed earlier in the Hyperlambda code to use it in subsequent calculations or logic.
 * - Retrieving configuration or parameters related to a [math.add] operation if it was used as part of a larger computation or algorithm.
