/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of its previous result set. It is used to navigate to the next node at the same level in the hierarchy. In this expression, it is used four times consecutively, indicating a traversal through four consecutive elder siblings. This might be used when you need to skip over nodes to reach a specific sibling node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this expression, it is used twice consecutively, indicating that after reaching a specific node through elder siblings, all children of that node are retrieved. This is useful when you want to process or evaluate all child nodes of a particular node.
 * 
 * 3. `.sse` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of its previous result set that has the name "sse". It is used to find a specific ancestor node named "sse" after navigating through elder siblings and children. This is useful when you need to ensure that the context or scope of the operation is within a specific section or node named "sse".
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set, which is now the ".sse" node. This is used to access all child nodes under the "sse" node, potentially to perform operations or evaluations on them.
 * 
 * 5. `.extra` - This retrieves the parent node of its previous result set that has the name "extra". It is used to find a specific ancestor node named "extra" after navigating through the "sse" node's children. This is useful when you need to ensure that the operation or evaluation is within a specific context or node named "extra".
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include navigating through a complex hierarchical data structure to find and operate on nodes within a specific context, such as configuration settings or data processing tasks that require accessing specific sections of a data model.
