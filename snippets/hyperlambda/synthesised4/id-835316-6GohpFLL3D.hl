// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, [unwrap] is used to evaluate the expression in the node following it, ensuring that any dynamic expressions are resolved before the node is processed. The expression [x:+/*] indicates that the evaluation should occur on the next sibling node, and all its children, effectively preparing the node's value for subsequent operations.
unwrap:x:+/*
