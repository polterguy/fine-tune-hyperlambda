// This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the MIME type for files with the ".txt" extension to "text/plain". The [case] slot is used to identify ".txt" files, and the [set-value] slot assigns the MIME type "text/plain" to the [.mime-type] node. This is useful for ensuring that text files are correctly identified and processed with the appropriate MIME type in applications.
