// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [finish_reason] exists and is not null within a JSON structure converted to a lambda object. If both conditions are true, it sets the value of [.finish_reason] to the value found in the JSON, unwraps the next sibling node, and sends a signal through sockets with the [finish_reason] as an argument. The slots involved include [if], [and], [exists], [not-null], [set-value], [unwrap], and [sockets.signal].
