/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it should find the first occurrence of this node name, which is typically used to access the arguments of a function or an HTTP endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any nodes that are directly under the `.arguments` node, which in this context, would be the individual argument nodes passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `api_key` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `api_key`. It is used to specifically access the `api_key` node among the children of the `.arguments` node, assuming it exists.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in an HTTP endpoint to retrieve the API key provided as an argument, allowing the endpoint to authenticate or authorize the request based on the provided key.
 * - It could be used in a function that requires an API key to interact with an external service, ensuring that the key is correctly extracted from the provided arguments.
