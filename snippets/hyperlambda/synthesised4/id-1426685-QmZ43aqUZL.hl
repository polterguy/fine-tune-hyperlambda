// This code snippet uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specific substring within a target string. The target string is referenced by the expression [@.result], and the substring to be replaced is specified by the placeholder [[extra]]. The replacement string is obtained using the [get-value] slot, which retrieves the value of the [extra] node from the [.arguments] node. This allows dynamic replacement of the substring based on the provided arguments.
strings.replace:x:@.result
   .:[[extra]]
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/extra
