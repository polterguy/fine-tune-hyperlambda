/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes into a destination node's children collection. 
 * // The [add] slot takes an expression pointing to the destination node as its primary argument, and the nodes to be added are specified as children.
 * // In this example, the [add] slot appends nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot to the [.urls] node's children collection.
 * // The [get-nodes] slot returns nodes referenced by its expression, which in this case is the value of the [.dp] node passed by reference.
 * // 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the destination node's children collection.
 * // 2. [get-nodes] - Returns nodes referenced by its expression, here the value of the [.dp] node by reference.
