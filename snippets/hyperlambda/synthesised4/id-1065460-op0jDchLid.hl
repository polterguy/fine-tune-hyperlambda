// 1. `@.no`: This iterator searches for the first node named `.no` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and the `.` before `no` suggests that it is specifically looking for a node with this exact name, possibly indicating a node that is a direct child or sibling in the current hierarchy. This type of iterator is useful when you need to access a specific node by its name within the current scope or hierarchy, allowing for precise navigation and manipulation of node values or structures.
