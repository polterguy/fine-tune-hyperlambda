/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node named "arguments". This is useful for accessing the arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which typically contains input parameters or configuration settings.
 * 
 * 2. `@.arguments`: Similar to the first iterator, this retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used again to ensure that the context is within the correct "arguments" node, possibly to differentiate between multiple "arguments" nodes at different levels.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current result set, which in this case would be the children of the second "arguments" node found. This is useful for iterating over or accessing all parameters or settings defined within the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 4. `max_context_tokens`: This iterator filters the result set to include only the nodes with the name "max_context_tokens". It is used to specifically target this node within the children of the "arguments" node, which likely holds a specific configuration or limit related to context tokens.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda script to retrieve the "max_context_tokens" setting from a configuration or input parameter node. This might be relevant in scenarios where there is a need to enforce or check against a maximum number of context tokens allowed in a given operation, such as in a language model's input processing.
