/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] to a specific location. The [add] slot targets the children of the current node's [execute] node, and [get-nodes] fetches all nodes under [.session]. This effectively appends all session nodes to the specified location. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to a specified location.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.session] node.
