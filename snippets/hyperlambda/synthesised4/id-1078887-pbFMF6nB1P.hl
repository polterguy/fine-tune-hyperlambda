// 1. `@.url`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "url" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node named "url". This is useful for retrieving a specific configuration or data node that might be defined higher up in the structure, such as a base URL for API requests or a resource location.
