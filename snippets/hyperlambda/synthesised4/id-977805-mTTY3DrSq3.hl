// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a database using the [data.read] slot. It specifies the table name as "customers" and limits the number of records returned to 1 using the [limit] argument. This is useful for retrieving a single record from the specified table.
data.read
   table:customers
   limit:int:1
