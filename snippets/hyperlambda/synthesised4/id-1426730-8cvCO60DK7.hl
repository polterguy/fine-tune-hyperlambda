/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.value] and returns it. The [get-value] slot is used to access the value of a node, and in this case, it points to the node named [.value]. The expression [@.value] specifies the node whose value is to be retrieved. This operation is useful when you need to access and possibly use the value of a specific node within a larger Hyperlambda graph.
 * // 
 * // 1. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression [@.value].
 * // 2. [@.value] - An expression that points to the node named [.value] whose value is to be retrieved.
