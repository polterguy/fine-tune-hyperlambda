/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a conditional comparison using the [if] slot to determine the order of two nodes based on their "name" values. It uses the [lt] slot to check if the "name" of the left-hand side node is less than that of the right-hand side node. If true, it sets the [.result] node's value to -1, indicating that the left node should come before the right node in sorting. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional check.
 * 2. [lt] - Compares if the left node's "name" is less than the right node's "name".
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the "name" value of the right-hand side node.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the actions to execute if the condition is true.
 * 5. [set-value] - Sets the [.result] node's value to -1, indicating the order for sorting.
