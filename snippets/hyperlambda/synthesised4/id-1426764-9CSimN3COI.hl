/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [case] slot to handle a specific scenario where a node's value is of type "varbinary". It is typically used within a [switch] statement to execute a particular block of code when the value matches the "varbinary" case. The [case] slot is used to define a condition that, when met, triggers the execution of its child nodes. This allows for conditional branching based on the type of data being processed, enabling different actions or logic to be applied depending on the data type encountered.
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Defines a condition to be checked, specifically for handling a "varbinary" type scenario.
