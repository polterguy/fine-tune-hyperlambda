// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes from one location to another within a Hyperlambda structure. Specifically, it takes all child nodes of the [.session] node and appends them to the [.cache-session] node. The [add] slot is used to specify the destination node, [.cache-session], and the [get-nodes] slot is used to retrieve all child nodes of the [.session] node to be added.
add:x:@.cache-session
   get-nodes:x:@.session/*
