/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [get-count] slot to count the number of child nodes under the [hyper2lambda] node. The expression "@hyper2lambda/*" is used to point to all children of the [hyper2lambda] node, and [get-count] returns the total number of these child nodes. This can be useful for determining the size of a node set or for conditional logic based on the number of nodes.
 * // 1. [get-count] - This slot returns the number of nodes its expression is pointing to.
 * // 2. [@hyper2lambda/*] - This expression points to all children of the [hyper2lambda] node.
