/*
 * 1. `+`: This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node. It moves one step down in the hierarchy to the next node at the same level.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It allows you to access all direct descendants of the node you are currently referencing.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: This is another `*` iterator, which again retrieves all children nodes of the current node. This allows you to access the next level of descendants, effectively going two levels deep from the elder sibling node.
 * 
 * 4. `message`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "message". It ensures that only nodes named "message" are selected from the previous result set.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to navigate a data structure where you need to find all "message" nodes that are two levels deep in the hierarchy from the elder sibling of the current node. 
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you are processing logs or notifications and need to extract specific "message" content from a structured data format.
