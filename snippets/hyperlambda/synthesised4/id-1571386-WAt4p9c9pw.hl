/*
 * 1. `+` - Moves to the next sibling node (the node immediately below the current node at the same indentation level).
 * 2. `+` - Moves again to the next sibling node (now two nodes below the original node).
 * 3. `+` - Moves to the third next sibling node (now three nodes below the original node).
 * 4. `+` - Moves to the fourth next sibling node (now four nodes below the original node).
 * 5. `*` - Retrieves all children of the current node (the fourth next sibling).
 * 6. `*` - Retrieves all children of each of those child nodes.
 * 7. `.sse` - Filters to only nodes named [.sse] among the grandchildren nodes.
 * 8. `*` - Retrieves all children of each [.sse] node.
 * 9. `.extra` - Filters to only nodes named [.extra] among the children of [.sse] nodes.
 * 
 * This expression ultimately finds the fourth next sibling node from the starting point, then drills down two levels of children, finds all [.sse] nodes at that level, gets their children, and finally selects all [.extra] nodes among those children.
