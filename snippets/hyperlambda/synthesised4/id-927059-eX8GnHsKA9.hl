/*
 * The code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the values of nodes within the [.system] node. It dynamically sets each node's value to the value of the current node being iterated over, using [get-name] to determine the target node and [get-value] to fetch the current node's value. This effectively copies values from one node set to another based on matching node names.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of nodes specified by its expression.
 * 2. [@.system/*/{@get-name}] - Targets nodes within [.system] using dynamic names from [get-name].
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the current node.
 * 4. [@.dp/#] - References the current node's value in the iteration.
