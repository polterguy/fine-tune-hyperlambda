// This Hyperlambda code sets specific HTTP response headers to control the response type and file attachment behavior. The [response.headers.set] slot is used to specify a "Content-Type" of "text/csv", making the response a CSV file. It also sets "Access-Control-Expose-Headers" to allow the "Content-Disposition" header to be exposed to the client, which is set to indicate the response is an attachment with the filename "training-snippets.csv".
response.headers.set
