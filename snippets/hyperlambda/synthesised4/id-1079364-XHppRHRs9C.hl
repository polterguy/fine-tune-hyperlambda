/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" within the current context. It searches for a node with this specific name, but only among the direct children of the node that is currently being evaluated. This is useful for accessing a specific node that contains SQL-related information or commands within a larger Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * Potential Use Cases:
 * - Retrieving a SQL query or command stored in a node named "sql" for execution or manipulation.
 * - Accessing configuration or connection details related to a SQL database that are stored in a node named "sql".
