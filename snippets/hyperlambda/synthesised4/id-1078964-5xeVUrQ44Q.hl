// 1. `@eq`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "eq" in the current context. It starts from the current node and traverses upwards through siblings and ancestors until it finds a node named "eq". This is useful in scenarios where you need to locate a specific comparison operation within a larger Hyperlambda structure, such as when you want to modify or inspect the condition being checked by an equality comparison in a dynamic or complex Hyperlambda script.
