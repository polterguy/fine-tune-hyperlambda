/*
 * 1. `@.dp`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name, and ".dp" specifies the exact name of the node it is looking for. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node within the current execution context, often used in loops or when dealing with dynamic parameters.
 * 
 * 2. `#`: This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the node is itself a node, allowing you to work with the node by reference. This is particularly useful when you want to modify the original node rather than a copy, enabling direct manipulation of the node's data.
