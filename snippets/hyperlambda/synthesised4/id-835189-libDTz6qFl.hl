// The [case] slot is used within a [switch] block to define a specific condition and its corresponding actions. When the value of the [switch] node matches the value of a [case] node, the actions defined within that [case] node are executed. This allows for conditional branching based on the value being evaluated, similar to switch-case statements in traditional programming languages.
