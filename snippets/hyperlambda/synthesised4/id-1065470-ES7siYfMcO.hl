 * 1. `@` - This iterator searches for the first node with the specified name in the current context. In this case, it looks for the first node named "fields" starting from the current node and searching through its siblings and their descendants.
 * 2. `.fields` - This specifies the name of the node we are looking for. The iterator will return the first node with this name it encounters. 
 * 
 * Use case: This expression can be used to retrieve the first occurrence of a node named "fields" in the current context, which might be useful when you need to access or manipulate data stored under this node in a Hyperlambda graph.
