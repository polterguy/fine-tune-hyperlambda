/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node. It's useful for moving to the next node in a sequence when you need to process or evaluate subsequent nodes.
 * 
 * 2. `+` - Another elder sibling retrieval, moving to the next node again. This can be used to skip nodes or move forward in a sequence for further processing.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It's useful for accessing all sub-nodes under a particular parent node, allowing for operations on multiple nodes at once.
 * 
 * 4. `.lambda` - This retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate upwards in the hierarchy, often to access or modify parent node properties or values.
 * 
 * 5. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the current node again. This is useful for iterating over or processing all sub-nodes under a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 6. `.task` - Retrieves the parent node of the current node. This is typically used to access or modify properties or values of the parent node, often in the context of task management or execution.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include navigating through a hierarchical data structure to process or evaluate nodes in sequence, particularly when dealing with tasks or lambda functions that require accessing both sibling and child nodes.
