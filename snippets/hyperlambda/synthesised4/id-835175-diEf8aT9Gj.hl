// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced, allowing forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, [unwrap] is used with the expression "x:+/*/*", which will evaluate the expression and replace the current node with the evaluated result. This is useful for dynamically determining node values or structures before execution.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
