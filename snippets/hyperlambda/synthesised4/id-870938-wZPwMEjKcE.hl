The [insert-before] slot allows for dynamic modification of the node structure by inserting nodes at specified positions. 
 * 
 * 1. [insert-before] - Inserts a node before the specified node in the expression.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the node to be inserted.
 * 3. [..] - Retrieves the value from the first child of the [.action] node.
