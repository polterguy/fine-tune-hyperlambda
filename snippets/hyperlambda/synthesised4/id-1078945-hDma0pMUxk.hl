/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or a slot, especially in the context of HTTP endpoints or dynamic slot executions where arguments are passed as children of an [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node(s). In this case, it will retrieve all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. This is useful when you want to perform operations or checks on all arguments passed to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `/message` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those with the name "message". It is used to specifically target nodes that carry a particular piece of information, in this case, a "message" argument.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a logging function to extract a "message" argument from the input arguments and log it.
 * - It could also be used in a validation function to ensure that a "message" argument is present and meets certain criteria before proceeding with further processing.
