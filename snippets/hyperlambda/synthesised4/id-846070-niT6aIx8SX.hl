// The code uses the [lt] slot to compare the result of an HTTP GET request's status code with the integer 300. If the status code is less than 300, the [lt] slot returns true. This is useful for checking if the HTTP request was successful, as status codes below 300 generally indicate success. The [http.get] slot retrieves a resource from a specified URL, and its status code is compared using [lt].
