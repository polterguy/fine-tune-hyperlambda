/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing the root arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, typically used to retrieve input parameters for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed into the function or endpoint, allowing you to iterate over or manipulate them.
 * 
 * 3. `order` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "order" from the previously retrieved children nodes of "arguments". It is useful for specifically accessing the "order" argument, assuming it is a parameter passed into the function or endpoint.
