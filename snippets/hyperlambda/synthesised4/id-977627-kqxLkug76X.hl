// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] slot to create a logical conjunction condition. It specifies a condition where the [product_id] node must have a value of 123. This is typically used within a larger context, such as a [where] clause in a SQL operation, to filter records based on multiple conditions being true simultaneously. The [and] slot allows for combining multiple conditions to ensure all specified criteria are met.
