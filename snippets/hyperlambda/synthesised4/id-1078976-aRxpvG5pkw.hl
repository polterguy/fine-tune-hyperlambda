/*
 * 1. `@.changes`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "changes" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name. This is useful for accessing specific nodes in a structured data set, especially when you need to refer back to a previously defined node in your Hyperlambda code.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or state changes that were defined earlier in the script.
 * - Retrieving a node that holds a list of modifications or updates to be processed further in the code.
