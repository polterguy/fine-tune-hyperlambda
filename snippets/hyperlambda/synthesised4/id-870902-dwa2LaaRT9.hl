/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert nodes into a specific location in a node graph. It retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node using [get-nodes] and adds them under the [or] node within a [data.read] structure. The [get-nodes] slot is used to fetch nodes based on their path expressions, allowing dynamic manipulation of the node graph. The code effectively illustrates how to dynamically construct or modify a query-like structure by adding conditions from different parts of the input arguments.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts nodes at the specified location in the node graph.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node based on the provided path expressions.
 * 3. [x:@.arguments/*/ml_training_snippets.prompt.like] - Path expression to fetch nodes related to prompt conditions.
 * 4. [x:@.arguments/*/ml_training_snippets.completion.like] - Path expression to fetch nodes related to completion conditions.
 * 5. [x:@.arguments/*/ml_training_snippets.uri.like] - Path expression to fetch nodes related to URI conditions.
