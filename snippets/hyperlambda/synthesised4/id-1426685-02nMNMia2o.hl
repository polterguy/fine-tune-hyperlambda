/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specific substring within a string with a new value. The code targets the node referenced by the expression in [strings.replace] and substitutes the substring specified in the first argument with the value obtained from the [get-value] slot in the second argument. The [strings.replace] slot is used to dynamically update the string content within the node specified by the expression. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.replace] - This slot is used to replace occurrences of a specified substring within a string.
 * 2. [x:@.result] - An expression pointing to the node where the replacement will occur.
 * 3. [.] - The first argument specifying the substring to be replaced.
 * 4. [get-value] - A slot used to retrieve the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 5. [x:@.url] - An expression pointing to the node whose value will replace the specified substring.
