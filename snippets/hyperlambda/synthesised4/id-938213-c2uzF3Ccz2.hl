// This Hyperlambda code checks if either [condition1] or [condition2] evaluates to true using the [or] slot. If at least one of these conditions is true, it sets the value of [result] to "At least one is true" using the [set-value] slot. The [if] slot evaluates the [or] condition and executes the [.lambda] block if the condition is met.
