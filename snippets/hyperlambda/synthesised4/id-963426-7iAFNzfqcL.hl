// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [yield] slot to return the result of an average order value calculation, which is obtained from a previously executed MSSQL scalar query. The [yield] slot forwards the evaluated expression result, in this case, the average order value, as the output of the Hyperlambda execution. The [average-order-value] node is assigned the result of the [mssql.scalar] expression, which is expected to contain the computed average value from a SQL query.
