// This Hyperlambda code snippet connects to a database and executes a SQL scalar query to count the number of machine learning requests made by a specific user within the last day. The [data.scalar] slot executes the SQL query, and the [@user] expression dynamically injects the user_id argument into the query.
data.scalar:"select count(*) from ml_requests where user_id = @user and created >= date('now', '-1 day')"
   @user:x:@.arguments/*/user_id
