/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a node structure to a specified location in the current graph. It targets the children of the [signal] node under the [exe] node, and inserts a new node with three children: [to], [from], and [channel]. Each of these child nodes has an expression pointing to a specific node in the current graph, effectively creating a mapping or transformation of data between nodes. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node structure to the specified location.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the root of the new node structure to be added.
 * 3. [to] - A child node of the new structure, with its value set to the result of the expression pointing to the [from] node.
 * 4. [from] - A child node of the new structure, with its value set to the result of the expression pointing to the [to] node.
 * 5. [channel] - A child node of the new structure, with its value set to the result of the expression pointing to the [channel] node.
