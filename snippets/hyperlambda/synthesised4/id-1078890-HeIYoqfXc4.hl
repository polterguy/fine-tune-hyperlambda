/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator searches for the first node named ".dp" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access a specific node that is expected to be present in the current context or its ancestors. This is often used to access a node that is passed by reference in a loop or a function call.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. If the value of the ".dp" node is another node or a node set, this iterator will allow you to access that node or node set directly. This is useful when the node's value is a reference to another node structure that you need to manipulate or inspect.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing for operations or checks on each child node.
 * 
 * 4. `completion` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "completion" from the previous result set. It is used to narrow down the node set to those specifically named "completion", which might be nodes representing the completion of a task, process, or operation.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you are iterating over a set of nodes, and for each node, you want to access and process its "completion" child nodes. This might be relevant in a workflow or task management system where each task has a "completion" node indicating its completion status or details.
