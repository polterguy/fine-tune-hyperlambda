/*
 * The code snippet changes the name of all nodes referenced by the expression [@.buffer/*/url/*/verb] to the value obtained from the expression [@.dp/#/*/verb]. The [set-name] slot is used to perform this operation, where the destination nodes can be multiple, but the source must be a single value.
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the name of nodes specified in its expression.
 * 2. [@.buffer/*/url/*/verb] - Expression pointing to the nodes whose name will be changed.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified in its expression.
 * 4. [@.dp/#/*/verb] - Expression pointing to the source node whose value will be used to rename the destination nodes.
