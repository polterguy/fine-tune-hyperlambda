// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing for forward evaluation. In this example, [unwrap] is applied with the [apply-lists] argument set to true, which means if the expression results in multiple nodes, it will add all source nodes as destination nodes into the unwrapped node, instead of throwing an exception. This is useful for handling multiple nodes in a seamless manner.
