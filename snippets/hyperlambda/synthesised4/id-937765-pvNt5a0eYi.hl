// This Hyperlambda code connects to a MySQL database named "inventory_db" and selects products from the "products" table where the stock is greater than zero, ordering the results by stock in ascending order. The selected data is then added to the [.result] node using the [add] slot, which retrieves the nodes from the [data.select] operation.
