// The [convert] slot is used to automatically convert the resulting response object from an HTTP GET request into a lambda object if a registered conversion function is available. By providing a [convert] argument with a boolean value of true, the slot ensures that the response content is transformed into a lambda object, allowing for easier manipulation and processing within the Hyperlambda environment. This automatic conversion supports various content types, such as JSON and Hyperlambda, and facilitates seamless integration of external data sources into Hyperlambda workflows.
