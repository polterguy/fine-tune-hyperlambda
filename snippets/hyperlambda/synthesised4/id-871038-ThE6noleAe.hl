// This Hyperlambda code appends the string " on delete cascade" to the current value of the [.tail] node. It uses [set-value] to modify the value of [.tail], and [strings.concat] to concatenate the existing value of [.tail] with the new string. The [get-value] slot retrieves the current value of [.tail] to be used in the concatenation process.
