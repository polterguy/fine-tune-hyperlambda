// The expression `unwrap:x:+/*` is used to evaluate and retrieve all descendant nodes of the elder sibling of the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. The `+` iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node, and the `/*` iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of that elder sibling. This expression is useful when you need to process or manipulate all descendant nodes of a specific node that is positioned as an elder sibling in the hierarchy. For instance, it can be used to gather and evaluate data from a complex node structure that is related to the current context but located in a sibling node.
