/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [case] slot to handle different conditions based on the value of a variable. It checks the value of the [tinyblob] node and executes the corresponding block of code for each case. The [case] slot allows for branching logic, enabling different actions to be taken depending on the value of [tinyblob].
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Defines a condition to be checked against the value of [tinyblob].
 * 2. [tinyblob] - The variable whose value is being evaluated in each [case].
 * 3. [default] - Provides a fallback action if none of the [case] conditions are met.
