// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [.onafter] exists within the [.arguments] node. If it does, it evaluates the [.onafter] node as a lambda object. The [if] slot is used to conditionally execute the [.lambda] block, which contains the [eval] slot to execute the [.onafter] node. This allows for dynamic execution of code based on the presence of the [.onafter] node.
