// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes into a destination node collection. The [add] slot takes an expression pointing to a destination node, and its children nodes are evaluated and added to this destination. In this example, [get-nodes] is used to retrieve nodes from a [for-each] loop, specifically the node referenced by [.dp], and these nodes are then added to the [.models] node. This allows for dynamic construction of node structures by iterating over a set of nodes and appending them to a target node.
