// Retrieves all [sockets.signal] nodes that are direct children of the parent node of the current node. Useful for finding and processing all socket signals within a specific context or data segment. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to handle or manipulate multiple socket signals that are grouped under a common parent node, such as in a real-time communication or messaging system.
