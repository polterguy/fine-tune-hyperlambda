/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement to perform conditional logic based on the value of a node named [h3]. The [switch] slot is used to evaluate the value of [h3] and execute different code blocks depending on its value. Each [case] slot represents a possible value for [h3], and the corresponding code block is executed if the value matches. If none of the [case] conditions are met, the [default] slot is executed. This allows for clean and organized branching logic based on multiple potential values of a single variable.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Initiates a switch statement to evaluate the value of [h3].
 * 2. [case] - Represents a possible value for [h3] and executes the corresponding code block if matched.
 * 3. [default] - Executes a code block if none of the [case] conditions are met.
