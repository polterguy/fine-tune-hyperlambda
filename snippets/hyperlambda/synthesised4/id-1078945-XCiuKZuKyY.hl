/*
 * 1. `@.session` - This iterator starts with the `@` character, which means it will search for the first node with the name "session" in the current context. The `.` following the `@` indicates that it will look for this node starting from the current node and traversing upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful for retrieving session-related data or configurations that are stored in a node named "session" within the current execution context. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing session variables or session-specific data in a web application.
 * - Retrieving configuration settings or user-specific information stored in a session node.
