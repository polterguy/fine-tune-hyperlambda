// Retrieves all [and] nodes that are children of any [where] nodes, which are themselves children of any [data.delete] nodes, found as children of any node from the current node's parent. This expression is useful for identifying specific conditions within a data deletion operation, allowing you to understand or modify the logical conditions applied during the deletion process. Potential use cases include auditing or modifying the conditions under which data is deleted in a Hyperlambda script.
