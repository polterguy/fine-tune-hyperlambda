/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code checks if there are no nodes with the names "yield", "return", or "return-nodes" within the "hyper2lambda" node or any of its descendants. If none of these nodes exist, the [not-exists] slot evaluates to true, otherwise it evaluates to false. This can be useful for conditionally executing code based on the presence or absence of specific nodes in a Hyperlambda structure.
 * // 1. [not-exists] - Evaluates to true if the specified expression yields zero results, checking for the absence of nodes.
 * // 2. [x:@hyper2lambda/**/[yield|return|return-nodes]/*] - The expression checks for nodes named "yield", "return", or "return-nodes" within "hyper2lambda" and its descendants.
