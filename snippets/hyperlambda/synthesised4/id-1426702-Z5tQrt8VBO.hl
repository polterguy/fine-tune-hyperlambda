// The code snippet uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and expand a node expression before the node where it's referenced is reached. The expression "x:+/*/*/*" is dynamically evaluated, and the resulting nodes are unwrapped and their values are assigned to the destination node. This allows for forward evaluation of expressions, enabling dynamic manipulation of node values in the Hyperlambda graph.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*
