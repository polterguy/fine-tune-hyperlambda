// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.select] slot to execute a SQL query that retrieves "conversation_starters" from the "ml_types" table where the "type" matches a specified argument. The [type] slot is used to dynamically insert the value from [.arguments/*/type] into the SQL query, allowing for parameterized queries and enhancing security by preventing SQL injection.
data.select:"\nselect conversation_starters\n\tfrom ml_types\n\twhere type = @type"
   type:x:@.arguments/*/type
