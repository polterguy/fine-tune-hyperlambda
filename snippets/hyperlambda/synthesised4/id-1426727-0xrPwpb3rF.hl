// This Hyperlambda code pauses the execution of the current thread for 100 milliseconds. The [sleep] slot is used to temporarily halt the thread, effectively releasing it back to the operating system, allowing other processes to utilize the CPU during this period. This is a non-blocking operation, meaning it doesn't consume CPU resources while the thread is "sleeping".
