// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [eq] slot to compare the values of two nodes, [value1] and [value2]. It retrieves the values of these nodes using the [get-value] slot and checks if they are exactly the same. If the values are equal, the [eq] slot evaluates to true.
eq
   get-value:x:@.value1
   get-value:x:@.value2
