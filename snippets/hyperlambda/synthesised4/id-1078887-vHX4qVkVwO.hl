/*
 * 1. `@signal`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "signal" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by its name, starting from the current node and traversing upwards through the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve a "signal" node that might contain important data or configuration settings needed for further processing.
 * - It could be used in a scenario where you need to check the status or value of a "signal" node to determine the flow of execution in your Hyperlambda code.
