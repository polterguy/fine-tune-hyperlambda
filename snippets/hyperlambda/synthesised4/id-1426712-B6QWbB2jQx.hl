// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate an expression before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied to the expression "x:+/*/*/*/content", which navigates through the node structure to find and evaluate the "content" node. This allows the "content" node's value to be evaluated and used before the execution reaches the point where the [unwrap] is declared.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*/content
