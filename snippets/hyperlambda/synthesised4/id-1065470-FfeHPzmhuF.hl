/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator looks for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda HTTP endpoint or a dynamically executed slot, where the arguments are passed in as children of this node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are passed as children to the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `offset` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `offset`. It is used to specifically access the `offset` argument, assuming it is a child of the `.arguments` node. This is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate the value of the `offset` argument specifically.
