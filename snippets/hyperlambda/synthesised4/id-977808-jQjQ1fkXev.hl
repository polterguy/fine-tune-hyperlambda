// This Hyperlambda code creates an information log entry with the message "Department name can be found as meta information in this log entry". It associates the department name as meta information with the log entry by retrieving the value of the [name] node from the current context using the expression [x:@.dp/#/*/name]. The [log.info] slot is used to log informational messages, and the meta information allows for additional context to be included with the log entry.
