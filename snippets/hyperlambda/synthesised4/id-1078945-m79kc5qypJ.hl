/*
 * 1. `@.cache-session`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "cache-session" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it should search for a node with the specified name, and the `.` indicates that it should start the search from the current node's context.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve session-related data that is cached within a Hyperlambda application. It might be used in scenarios where you need to access session-specific information, such as user authentication tokens or session variables, that are stored under a node named "cache-session".
