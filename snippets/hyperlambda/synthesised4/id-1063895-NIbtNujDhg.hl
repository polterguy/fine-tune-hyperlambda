// 1. `@.tail`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "tail" starting from the current node and traversing upwards through its siblings and ancestors. It will return the first match it finds. This is useful when you need to access a specific node in a hierarchy where the node's position is not fixed, but its name is known.
