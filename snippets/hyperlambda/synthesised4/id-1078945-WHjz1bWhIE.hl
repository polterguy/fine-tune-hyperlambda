/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is useful when you need to access the top-level node of your current execution context, regardless of where you are in the node hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it will retrieve all children nodes of the root node. This is useful when you want to perform operations on all direct descendants of the root node.
 * 
 * 3. `return` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "return". It is used to find specific nodes that match the given name within the previously retrieved node set. In this case, it will find all "return" nodes that are children of the root node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to gather all "return" nodes that are direct children of the root node in a Hyperlambda execution context. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or validate the return values of a Hyperlambda script, ensuring that all return points are correctly configured or to collect return values for further processing.
