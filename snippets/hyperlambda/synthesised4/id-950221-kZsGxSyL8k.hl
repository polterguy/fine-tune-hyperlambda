// This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a substring within a string. It retrieves the substring to be replaced and the replacement string from the [what] and [with] nodes, respectively, using [get-value]. The [strings.replace] slot then performs the replacement operation on the string referenced by [@.result].
strings.replace:x:@.result
   get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/what
   get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/with
