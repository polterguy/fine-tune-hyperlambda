// 1. `@.no` - This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which indicates that it will search for the first node with the name "no" starting from the current node and traversing upwards through its ancestors. This is useful when you want to find a specific node that is not necessarily a direct parent but exists somewhere in the hierarchy above the current node.
