/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a URL has not been processed yet and starts with a specific prefix, then adds it to a list of URLs. The [if] condition uses [and] to combine multiple checks: it verifies that the current URL (from [.dp]) does not exist in the [done] or [urls] lists, and that it starts with a given prefix from [.arguments/url]. If all conditions are true, the URL is added to the [urls] list.
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Begins a conditional statement.
 * 2. [and] - Combines multiple conditions that all must be true.
 * 3. [not-exists] - Checks if the current URL is not in the [done] list.
 * 4. [not-exists] - Checks if the current URL is not in the [urls] list.
 * 5. [strings.starts-with] - Checks if the current URL starts with a specified prefix.
 * 6. [.lambda] - Contains the actions to perform if the condition is true.
 * 7. [add] - Adds the current URL to the [urls] list.
 * 8. [get-nodes] - Retrieves the current URL node to be added.
