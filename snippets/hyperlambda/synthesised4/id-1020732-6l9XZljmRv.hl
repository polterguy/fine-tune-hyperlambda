/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before it in its hierarchy that matches the given name. In this case, it looks for the first node named "result" in the current context.
 * 2. `.result` - This specifies the name of the node being searched for by the `@` iterator. It indicates that the expression is looking for a node named "result". 
 * 
 * This expression is used to find and reference a node named "result" that is located earlier in the hierarchy of the current Hyperlambda context. It is useful when you need to access or modify the value of a node named "result" that has been previously defined in the same scope.
