// This Hyperlambda code throws an exception with the message "Nonce is not valid!" and sets the HTTP status code to 400. The exception is marked as public, meaning it will be propagated to the client even in release builds. The slots used are [throw] for raising the exception, [status] for setting the HTTP status code, and [public] to ensure the exception is visible to the client.
throw:Nonce is not valid!
   status:int:400
