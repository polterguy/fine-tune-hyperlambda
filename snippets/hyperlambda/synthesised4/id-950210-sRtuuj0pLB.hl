// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each child node of [.data] using [for-each], and for each iteration, it replaces occurrences of a substring in [.result] with another substring. The [set-value] slot updates the [.result] node with the modified string, using [strings.replace] to perform the replacement based on the values retrieved from the current node's children [.what] and [.with].
