/*
 * 1. `@.model` - This iterator searches for the first node named "model" within the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary, but it will not traverse siblings. This is useful for accessing a specific node that acts as a container or parent for other nodes.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set, which in this case is the "model" node. It allows you to access all direct descendants of the "model" node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `system_message` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "system_message" from the children nodes of the "model" node. It is useful for extracting specific information or data points that are labeled as "system_message" within a larger data structure.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving system messages from a model configuration or data structure where "system_message" nodes contain important notifications or instructions.
 * - Accessing specific configuration or metadata related to a model's operation or state, which is stored under "system_message" nodes.
