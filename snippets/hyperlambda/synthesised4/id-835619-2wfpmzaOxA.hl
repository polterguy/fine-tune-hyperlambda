// The [return-nodes] slot returns a collection of nodes specified by its expression. In this example, it returns all nodes resulting from the [data.select] operation, which is typically used to fetch records from a database. The [return-nodes] slot is often used within dynamically created slots or contexts that explicitly support returning nodes.
