/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes to a specified destination node. It specifically adds a node structure containing a [name] node and a [tables] node to the [.result] node. The [name] node's value is derived from the currently iterated node, referenced by [.dp]. This approach allows for the dynamic construction of node structures based on the context of the iterated nodes.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified destination node.
 * 2. [.] - Represents a node with children to be added.
 * 3. [name] - Sets the value of the node to the name of the currently iterated node.
 * 4. [tables] - Represents a node to be added as part of the structure.
