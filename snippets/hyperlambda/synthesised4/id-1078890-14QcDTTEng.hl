 * 1. `@.prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node named "prompt" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that the search is for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that the search is within the current node's context or its siblings. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve a configuration or instruction node named "prompt" that is crucial for guiding the behavior of a script or function.
 * - It might be used in a scenario where multiple sibling nodes exist, and the script needs to extract or manipulate the specific node named "prompt" for further processing or evaluation.
