/*
 * This Hyperlambda code adds nodes from the [payload] node within a specific range in the [http.post] node, which is a child of the [data.connect] node, to the [batch_size] node located in the [.arguments] node. The [add] slot is used to perform this operation. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds nodes from the specified source to the target node.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes specified by its expression, in this case, the [batch_size] node within the [.arguments] node.
