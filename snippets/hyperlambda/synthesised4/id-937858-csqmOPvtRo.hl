// The [else] slot in Hyperlambda is used for conditional branching, executed only if none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are true. Unlike [if] and [else-if], [else] directly contains its executable code as child nodes without requiring a [.lambda] node. This structure allows [else] to act as a default action when all other conditions fail.
