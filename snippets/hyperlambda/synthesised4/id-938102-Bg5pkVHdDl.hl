/*
 * This code snippet demonstrates the use of the [convert] slot to change the type of a value. The [convert] slot is invoked with an expression pointing to the node whose value is to be converted, and the target type is specified as a child node. The [type] node indicates the desired type for conversion. If the conversion is successful, the value is transformed to the specified type. If not, an exception is thrown. 
 * 
 * 1. [convert] - Initiates the conversion process for a node's value.
 * 2. [type] - Specifies the target type to which the value should be converted.
