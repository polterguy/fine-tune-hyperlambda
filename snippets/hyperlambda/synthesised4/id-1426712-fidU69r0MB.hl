/*
 * The Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied as a value. Specifically, it targets nodes with the name "url" that are descendants of nodes named "signal", which are themselves children of the current node's children. This effectively evaluates and replaces these "url" nodes with their resolved values. 
 * 
 * 1. [unwrap] - Forward evaluates all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied as a value to unwrap itself.
 * 2. [x:./*/signal/*/url] - The expression targets "url" nodes that are descendants of "signal" nodes, which are children of the current node's children.
