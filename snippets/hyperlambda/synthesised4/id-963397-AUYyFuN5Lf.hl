// The Hyperlambda code connects to a PostgreSQL database named "monitoring" using [pgsql.connect] and executes a SQL statement with [pgsql.execute] to create a table named "events" if it doesn't already exist. The table includes columns for an auto-incrementing primary key "id", a non-null text field "name", and a "timestamp" field with a default value of the current timestamp.
pgsql.connect:monitoring
   pgsql.execute:@"
create table if not exists events (
  id serial primary key,
  name text not null,
  timestamp timestamptz default now()
)"
