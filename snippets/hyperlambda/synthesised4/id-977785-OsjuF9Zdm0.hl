// This code snippet demonstrates how to perform an HTTP POST request to the specified URL, "https://api.example.com/crm/customers", using the [http.post] slot in Hyperlambda. The request includes a payload constructed from data retrieved using lambda expressions, specifically fetching the [name], [email], and [username] from a data source referenced by [data.read]. The payload is dynamically populated with these values, allowing for seamless integration with the target API endpoint.
http.post:"https://api.example.com/crm/customers"
   payload
      name:x:@data.read/*/*/name
      email:x:@data.read/*/*/email
      username:x:@data.read/*/*/username
