// The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression. In this example, it navigates through a complex path to find the desired node. The expression starts by referencing the [.dp] node, then de-references its value with [#], traverses to all its children with [*], filters by name with [@src], and finally selects the first node in the result set with [0,1].
