/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.cache-key] to a concatenated string. The concatenation is done using the [strings.concat] slot, which combines the value retrieved from the [session] node within the [.arguments] node with the static string ".IDs". 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 2. [@.cache-key] - Expression pointing to the node whose value is to be set.
 * 3. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [session] node within [.arguments].
 * 5. [.arguments/*/session] - Expression pointing to the [session] node within [.arguments].
 * 6. [.:"IDs"] - Static string to be concatenated with the session value.
