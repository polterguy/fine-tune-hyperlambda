/*
 * The code snippet uses the [add] slot to insert a new node into a specific location within a node graph. It targets the first child of the [snippets] node, specifically its first child, and then inserts a new node after the specified position. The new node is created without a value, indicating a placeholder or a structural addition to the graph. This operation is useful for dynamically modifying the structure of a node graph by adding nodes at specific locations. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts a new node into the node graph at the specified location.
 * 2. [@.snippets/0/-] - Specifies the target location for the insertion, pointing to the first child of the [snippets] node.
 * 3. [.] - Represents the new node being added, which is created without a value.
