// The [case] slot is used within a [switch] statement to define a specific condition that, when matched, executes the associated lambda object. Each [case] must have a value, which is compared against the evaluated value of the [switch]. If a match is found, the corresponding [case] block is executed. If no [case] matches, an optional [default] block can be executed instead.
