// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Employees" and "ReportsTo", using the "EmployeeID" column as the join condition. The join is aliased as "ReportsTo" and specifies that the "Employees.ReportsTo" column should match the "ReportsTo.EmployeeID" column.
