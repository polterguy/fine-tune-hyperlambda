// The code demonstrates the use of the [else-if] slot in Hyperlambda, which is evaluated only if the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are false. If the [else-if] condition evaluates to true, the associated [.lambda] block is executed. In this example, when the [else-if] condition is true, the [.lambda] block sets the value of the [.result] node to "OK". The [else-if] slot allows for conditional branching in Hyperlambda, similar to traditional programming languages.
