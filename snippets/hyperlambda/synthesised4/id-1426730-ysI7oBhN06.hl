// The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expressions it points to before the node where it's referenced is reached, effectively "forward evaluating" expressions. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate all descendant nodes of the current node, ensuring their values are processed before the execution continues. The expression "x:+/*/*" indicates that it targets all descendant nodes two levels deep from the current node.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
