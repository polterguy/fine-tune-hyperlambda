// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate a complex expression before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the expression navigates through multiple levels of nodes to reach a specific [content] node. The result of this evaluation is then used as the value for the node where [unwrap] is applied, allowing for dynamic content retrieval and assignment.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*/content
