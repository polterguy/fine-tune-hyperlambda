/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.dp` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with this specific name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the `.dp` node. It assumes that the value of the `.dp` node is another node, effectively allowing you to work with the node that the `.dp` node's value points to.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the node that was de-referenced in the previous step. It allows you to access all direct descendants of the node that `.dp` points to.
 * 
 * 4. `input` - This filters the children nodes retrieved in the previous step to only include those with the name `input`. It effectively narrows down the node set to those named `input`.
 * 
 * 5. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of each `input` node found in the previous step. It allows you to access all direct descendants of each `input` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to process or validate input data that is nested within a specific structure. For example, if `.dp` represents a form or a data entry point, this expression could be used to access and manipulate all input fields within that form.
