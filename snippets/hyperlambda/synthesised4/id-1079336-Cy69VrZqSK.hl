/*
 * 1. `@.fields` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "fields" that is an ancestor or sibling of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, checking each node's name until it finds a match. This is useful for locating a specific node within a larger structure when you know its name but not its exact position relative to the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "fields" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "fields" node, allowing you to perform operations on or retrieve information from each of these child nodes. This is particularly useful when you want to process or analyze multiple nodes that are grouped under a common parent node named "fields".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving all field definitions or configurations from a data structure where fields are grouped under a "fields" node.
 * - Iterating over each field to perform operations such as validation, transformation, or aggregation.
