// This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if the HTTP status code returned by a previous [http.post] invocation is less than 300. If the condition is true, it indicates that the HTTP request was successful, as status codes below 300 typically represent successful HTTP responses. The [lt] slot is used to perform this comparison, where "lt" stands for "less than". The expression "x:@http.post" retrieves the status code from the [http.post] node, and compares it against the integer value 300.
lt:x:@http.post
   .:int:300
