// The code uses the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the [distinct_column] argument is one of the specified valid column names. It checks if the provided column name matches any of the listed options, which include columns from the "activities" table and a column from the "client_id" table. If the [distinct_column] value does not match any of these specified columns, an exception is thrown.
