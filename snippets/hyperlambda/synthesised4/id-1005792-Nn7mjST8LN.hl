/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator looks for the first node with the name "arguments" in the current hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards, checking siblings and ancestors until it finds a node named "arguments".
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "arguments" node. It allows you to access any node that is directly under the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `limit` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "limit" from the children nodes of the "arguments" node. It effectively selects the "limit" node if it exists among the children of "arguments".
 * 
 * This expression is typically used to access a specific parameter or argument named "limit" that is passed to a Hyperlambda function or endpoint. It ensures that the "limit" node is retrieved from the arguments provided, allowing the function to use its value for further processing, such as limiting the number of items to process or return.
