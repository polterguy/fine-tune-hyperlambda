// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [or] slot to evaluate conditions. It checks if either of the two conditions is true: whether the type is equal to "name" or the type is equal to "email". If any of these conditions evaluates to true, the [or] slot will return true. This is useful for branching logic where multiple conditions can lead to the same outcome.

   type.eq:name
   type.eq:email
