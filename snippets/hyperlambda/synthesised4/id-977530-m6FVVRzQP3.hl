// This Hyperlambda code logs a message indicating that a "LOC" (likely "Line of Code") has been generated. It retrieves values from the [.arguments] node for [loc], [type], and [name], and includes these in the log entry. The [log.info] slot is used to create an informational log entry. The slots [loc], [type], and [name] extract specific argument values to be logged.
log.info:LOC generated
   loc:x:@.arguments/*/loc
