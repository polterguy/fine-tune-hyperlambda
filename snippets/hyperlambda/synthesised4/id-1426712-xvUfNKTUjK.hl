// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [math.increment] slot to increase the value of a node named [.no-invocation] by 1. The [math.increment] slot modifies the value of the node directly, without the need for additional [set-value] operations. The expression [x:@.no-invocation] specifies the node whose value is to be incremented. If no step value is provided, the default increment is by 1.
math.increment:x:@.no-invocation
