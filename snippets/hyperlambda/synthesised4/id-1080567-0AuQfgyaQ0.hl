/*
 * 1. `@.words`: This iterator starts by locating the first node named `words` within the current context. The `@` symbol is used to find a node by its name, and the `.` indicates that the search is limited to the current node's context, meaning it will look for a sibling or child node named `words`.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `words` node found in the previous step. The `*` symbol is used to gather all direct children of a node, allowing for operations or evaluations to be performed on each of these child nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to iterate over a list of words stored as child nodes under a `words` node, perhaps for processing or transformation purposes, such as counting the number of words, checking for specific words, or applying some transformation to each word.
