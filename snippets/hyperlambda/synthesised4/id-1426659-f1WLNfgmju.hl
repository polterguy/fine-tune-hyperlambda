/*
 * /*
 *  * This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to concatenate the first non-null value from two potential sources into a single string.
 *  * It uses the [set-value] slot to set the value of a node, identified by the expression [@.snippets/0/-/*/completion].
 *  * The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate strings.
 *  * The [get-first-value] slot retrieves the first non-null value from its children nodes or expressions.
 *  * The [get-value] slot is used to fetch the value of nodes specified by its expression.
 *  * 
 *  * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the node specified by the expression.
 *  * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates strings from its children nodes.
 *  * 3. [get-first-value] - Retrieves the first non-null value from its children nodes.
 *  * 4. [get-value] - Fetches the value of the node specified by its expression.
