// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the [name] node, which is a child of the node currently being iterated over in a [for-each] loop. The expression uses [get-value] to access the [name] node's value by navigating through the current node reference [.dp], de-referencing its value with [#], and selecting its child [name].
