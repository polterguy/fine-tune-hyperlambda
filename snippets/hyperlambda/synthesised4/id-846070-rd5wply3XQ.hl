// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.url] node by concatenating the value of the [.base] node, a static string "/", and a specific substring from a node referenced by a complex expression. The [set-value] slot changes the value of [.url], while [strings.concat] combines multiple strings, including values retrieved using [get-value]. The complex expression in [get-value] navigates through the node structure to extract a specific substring.
