/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the result of an HTTP POST request is either a 429 (Too Many Requests) or a 500 (Internal Server Error) status code. If either condition is true, it sends a signal through a socket to a feedback channel, informing that the process will continue in 5 seconds to let OpenAI cool down, and then it pauses execution for 5 seconds. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional check.
 * 2. [or] - Logical OR to evaluate multiple conditions.
 * 3. [eq] - Checks if the HTTP POST result is 429.
 * 4. [eq] - Checks if the HTTP POST result is 500.
 * 5. [.lambda] - Executes the following block if any condition is true.
 * 6. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to the feedback channel.
 * 7. [args] - Arguments for the signal.
 * 8. [message] - Message content indicating a pause.
 * 9. [type] - Type of message, set to "info".
 * 10. [sleep] - Pauses execution for 5 seconds.
