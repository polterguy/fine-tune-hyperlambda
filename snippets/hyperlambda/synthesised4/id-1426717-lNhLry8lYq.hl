/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet updates the value of a node by replacing its current content with a dynamically generated string. It uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the node pointed to by the expression [@.scan/0/*/completion]. The new value is created using the [strings.mixin] slot, which combines the result of a Hyperlambda expression with a surrounding string. The expression [@.scan/0/*/completion] is evaluated, and the result is concatenated with a prompt obtained from [@.arguments/*/prompt]. This allows for dynamic content generation based on input arguments. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node specified by the expression.
 * 2. [strings.mixin] - Combines the result of a Hyperlambda expression with a surrounding string.
 * 3. [prompt] - Retrieves the prompt value from the arguments to be used in the mixin.
