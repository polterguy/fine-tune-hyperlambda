// The code dynamically adds nodes to each child node of the current node's children. It uses [add] to append nodes obtained from [get-nodes], which retrieves all children nodes of the current node being iterated over, referenced by [.dp]. The [add] slot targets each child node of the current node's children, indicated by the expression "+/*/*". This allows for dynamic modification of the node structure by adding retrieved nodes to multiple destinations simultaneously.
