// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.result] node. It employs the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a string within the current [.result] value. The [get-value] slot retrieves the "what" and "with" values from the [.dp] node, which are used as the search and replacement strings, respectively. The code effectively updates the [.result] node by replacing specified substrings.
