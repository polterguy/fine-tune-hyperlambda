// This code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a "users" table where the "username" matches the email extracted from a verified authentication token. The [data.read] slot is used to query the database, and the [where] clause specifies the condition for filtering records based on the equality of the "username" field and the email value obtained from the [auth.token.verify] slot.
data.read
   table:users
   where
      and
         username.eq:x:@auth.token.verify/*/email
