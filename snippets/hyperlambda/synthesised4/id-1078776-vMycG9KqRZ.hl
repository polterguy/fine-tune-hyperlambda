/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you need to locate a specific node by name, especially when the node is not a direct child of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator selects all children of the node(s) found by the previous iterator. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "hyper2lambda" node. This is helpful when you want to perform operations on or retrieve information from all child nodes under a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `.request-id`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "request-id" from the previously selected children. It is used to pinpoint a specific node among potentially many children, allowing for precise data retrieval or manipulation.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include retrieving a unique request identifier from a structured data set, such as a log or a configuration file, where "hyper2lambda" is a known section or category, and "request-id" is a specific attribute or piece of data within that section.
