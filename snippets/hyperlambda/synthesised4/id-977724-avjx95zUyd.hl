// The code demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to query a SQLite database table named "roles". It selects the count of entries in the table and aliases it as "count". The query includes a [where] clause with an [and] condition, although no specific conditions are provided. The [limit] is set to 1, restricting the result to a single record. The [database-type] argument specifies the use of SQLite for the query execution.
