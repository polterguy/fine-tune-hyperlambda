// Extracts a substring from the [file-data] node, starting from the second character and ending two characters before the string's end. The [strings.substring] slot is used with a dynamic length calculated by subtracting 2 from the total length of [file-data]. The [math.subtract] slot computes the length of the substring by subtracting 2 from the result of [strings.length], which determines the total length of the string.
