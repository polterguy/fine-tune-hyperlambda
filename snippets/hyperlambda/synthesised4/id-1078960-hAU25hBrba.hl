/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument individually.
 * 
 * 3. `delay` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name `delay`. It is used to specifically target the argument named `delay` within the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot to retrieve the value of a specific argument named `delay` that was passed to a function or endpoint. This is useful in scenarios where you need to perform operations based on a time delay or timeout value specified by the user.
