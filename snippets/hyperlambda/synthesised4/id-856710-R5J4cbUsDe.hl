// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the current node to the result of the [get-count] slot. The [get-count] slot counts the number of nodes returned by the expression [@vocabulary/*], which retrieves all child nodes of the [vocabulary] node. The result is then set as the value of the current node using [set-value].
set-value:x:-
   get-count:x:@vocabulary/*
