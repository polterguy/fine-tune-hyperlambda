/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator searches for the first node named "session" that is an ancestor or sibling of the current node. It starts looking from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it should start from the current node's level. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving session-related information in a web application, such as user authentication details or session-specific data.
 * - Accessing configuration or state data stored in a "session" node that is shared across different parts of the application logic.
