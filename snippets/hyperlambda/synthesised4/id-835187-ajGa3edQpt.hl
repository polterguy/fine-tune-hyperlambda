// The code constructs a URL by concatenating a base URL with a path extracted from a node's attribute. It uses [set-value] to assign the result to [.url], [strings.concat] to concatenate strings, and [get-value] to retrieve values from specified nodes. The expression in [get-value] accesses the "@href" attribute of a node, demonstrating the use of escaped characters in expressions.
set-value:x:@.url
   strings.concat
      get-value:x:@.base
      .:/
      get-value:x:"@.dp/#/*/\\@href"
