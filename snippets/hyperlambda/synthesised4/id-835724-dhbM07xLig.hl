// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [return-nodes] slot to return a collection of nodes from a specified path. The [return-nodes] slot is typically used within dynamically created slots or contexts that explicitly allow returning nodes. In this example, it returns all nodes located at the path specified by the expression `@data.read/*/*`.
return-nodes:x:@data.read/*/*
