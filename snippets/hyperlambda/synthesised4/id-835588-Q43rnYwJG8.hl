/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes from the [.arguments] node set to a specific location within a data structure. The [add] slot is used to insert nodes at the path specified by its expression, which targets the [where] node under [data.read]. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all nodes under [.arguments] to be added. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts nodes at the specified path in the data structure.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node set to be added.
