/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to navigate up the hierarchy to find the node named "arguments" from the current position. This is often used in Hyperlambda to access the arguments node in a dynamic slot or HTTP endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access all the arguments passed to a dynamic slot or HTTP endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `useAsDefault` - This iterator filters the result to only include nodes with the name "useAsDefault" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target the "useAsDefault" argument, which might be used to determine if a default value should be applied or some default behavior should be executed.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a dynamic slot or HTTP endpoint to check if the "useAsDefault" argument has been provided, allowing the logic to conditionally apply default settings or behaviors based on its presence or value.
 * - It might be used in a configuration or setup process where certain parameters can be overridden by default values if "useAsDefault" is set to true.
