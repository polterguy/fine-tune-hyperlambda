// This Hyperlambda code checks if a file named "server.log" exists in the "/var/logs/" directory. If it does, it loads the file and extracts all URLs using a regular expression. The extracted URLs are then iterated over, added to a list, and converted to a Hyperlambda string format. Finally, the extracted URLs are logged as an informational message. The code uses slots like [io.file.exists], [io.file.load], [strings.matches], and [lambda2hyper] to perform these operations.
