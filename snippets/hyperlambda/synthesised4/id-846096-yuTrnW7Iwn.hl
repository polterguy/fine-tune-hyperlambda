// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a block of code when previous conditions have not been met. Within this block, the [set-value] slot changes the value of the [.result] node by invoking [strings.replace] to substitute occurrences of the string "[[new_tab]]" with "false". This operation is performed on the current value of [.result].
