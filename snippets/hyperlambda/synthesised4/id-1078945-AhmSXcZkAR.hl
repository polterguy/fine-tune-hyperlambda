/*
 * 1. `@strings.split`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "strings.split" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node in the Hyperlambda structure that is responsible for splitting a string based on a delimiter.
 * 
 * 2. `1`: This iterator retrieves the second child of the node returned by the previous iterator. In Hyperlambda, child nodes are zero-indexed, so "1" refers to the second child. This is useful for accessing a specific part of the result from the "strings.split" operation, which typically returns multiple nodes representing the split parts of the string.
 * 
 * **Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used to access the second element of a string that has been split by a delimiter, such as accessing the second word in a sentence.
 * - It can be utilized in scenarios where you need to process or manipulate a specific part of a split string, such as extracting a particular field from a CSV line.
