// This Hyperlambda code transforms a cached lambda object into a semantic lambda object (graph object) using the [hyper2lambda] slot. The expression `@cache.try-get` is used to specify the source of the Hyperlambda text, which is the cached item associated with the key "cache.try-get". This allows for converting the cached Hyperlambda text into an executable lambda object, enabling further manipulation or execution within the current context.
