/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [notnull] node inside the [.dp] node is equal to 1. If true, it adds a new node with the name [nullable] and the value of false to the [.tmp] node. The [if] slot evaluates the condition, and if the condition is true, the [.lambda] block is executed. The [add] slot is used to add the [nullable] node to [.tmp]. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Evaluates a condition to determine if the following [.lambda] should be executed.
 * 2. [eq] - Compares two values for equality.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [notnull] node.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the [if] condition is true.
 * 5. [add] - Adds a new node to the [.tmp] node.
 * 6. [nullable] - The node being added with a boolean value of false.
