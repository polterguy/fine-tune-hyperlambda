/*
 * 1. `@.has-sent-waiting` - This iterator looks for the first node with the name "has-sent-waiting" starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. This is useful when you want to check or retrieve a specific node that may exist higher up in the node hierarchy, often used in scenarios where you need to verify the presence of a certain condition or state that is set earlier in the execution flow. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Checking if a certain flag or state (e.g., "has-sent-waiting") has been set earlier in the execution process to determine if a certain action should be taken.
 * - Retrieving configuration or status information that is set at a higher level in a nested structure.
