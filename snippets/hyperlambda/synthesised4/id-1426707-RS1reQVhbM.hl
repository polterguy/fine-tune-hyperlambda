/*
 * This code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot in Hyperlambda to retrieve the type name of a node's value. The example initializes a node [.foo] with an integer value of 57 and then uses the [type] slot to obtain the type of the node's value. The [type] slot is executed with an expression pointing to the node whose type is to be retrieved. After execution, the [type] slot will contain the type name of the node's value, which in this case is "int". 
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type name of the node's value specified in its expression.
