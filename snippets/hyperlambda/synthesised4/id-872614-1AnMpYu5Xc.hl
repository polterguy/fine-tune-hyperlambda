// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using the [data.read] slot with a SQLite database. It specifies a [table] named "tasks" and performs a left [join] with the "users" table, using "user_id" as an alias. The query retrieves [columns] with an aggregate function aliased as "result". It includes a [where] clause for filtering and a [group] clause for grouping results by "group_column".
