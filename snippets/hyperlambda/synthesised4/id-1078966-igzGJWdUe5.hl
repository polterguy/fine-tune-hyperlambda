/*
 * 1. `@.model`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "model" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards through its ancestors and siblings until it finds a match. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is not a direct child or descendant of the current node, but rather a sibling or ancestor. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or metadata stored in a "model" node that is shared across different parts of a Hyperlambda graph.
 * - Retrieving a node that contains a data model or schema definition needed for processing or validation purposes.
