// This Hyperlambda code uses the [validators.mandatory] slot to ensure that the node specified by the expression [@.arguments/*/prompt] is present and has a non-null value. If the specified node is missing or its value is null, an exception will be thrown. This is useful for enforcing that certain required arguments are provided in a Hyperlambda execution context.
