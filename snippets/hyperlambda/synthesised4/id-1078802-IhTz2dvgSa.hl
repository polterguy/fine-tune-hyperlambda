/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda`: This iterator searches for the first node named "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary, but it does not traverse sibling nodes. This is useful when you want to locate a specific node by name that might be an ancestor or at the same level in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "hyper2lambda" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the specified node, allowing you to perform operations or checks on each child node.
 * 
 * 3. `produces`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "produces" among the children of the "hyper2lambda" node. It is useful for narrowing down the node set to those with a specific name, enabling targeted operations or evaluations.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to extract or manipulate data related to "produces" nodes within a specific "hyper2lambda" context, such as generating a list of outputs or results produced by a particular process or module.
 * - It could also be used in a validation or transformation process where specific attributes or configurations under "produces" need to be checked or modified.
