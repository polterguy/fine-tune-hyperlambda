/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node within the hierarchy that matches the given name.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "signal" node. It is used to access the children of the "signal" node, allowing further filtering or processing.
 * 
 * 3. `db_time` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "db_time" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to find specific nodes named "db_time" among the children of the "signal" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve the "db_time" node(s) under the "signal" node, which might represent database timestamps or related information in a data processing or logging system.
 * - It could be used in a monitoring system to extract and analyze database timing information associated with specific signals or events.
