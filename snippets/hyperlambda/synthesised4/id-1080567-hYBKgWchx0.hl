/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named [sql] within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node with the specified name, and the `.` implies that it starts the search from the current node's parent. This expression will return the first [sql] node it encounters in the current hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve a SQL query or command stored in a node named [sql] for further processing or execution.
 * - It might be part of a larger Hyperlambda script that dynamically constructs or modifies SQL commands based on certain conditions or inputs.
