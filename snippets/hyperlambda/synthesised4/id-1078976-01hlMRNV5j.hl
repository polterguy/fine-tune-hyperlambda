/*
 * 1. `@.table`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "table" from the current context. The `@` symbol signifies that the search is for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that the search starts from the current node's context. This expression is useful when you need to access a specific node named "table" within the current hierarchy to either read its value, modify it, or perform further operations on its children or attributes. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a configuration or data node named "table" to retrieve or update its contents.
 * - Using the "table" node as a reference point for further data processing or manipulation within a larger Hyperlambda script.
