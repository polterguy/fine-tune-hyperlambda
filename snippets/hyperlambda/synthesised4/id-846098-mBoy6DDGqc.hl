// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a block of code when all preceding conditional slots (like [if] or [else-if]) evaluate to false. In this case, it uses [set-value] to change the value of the [.result] node by replacing occurrences of the string "[[stream]]" with "false" within the current value of [.result]. The [strings.replace] slot is used to perform the string replacement operation.
