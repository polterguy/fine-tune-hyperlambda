// The [unwrap] slot in this code is used to forward evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. The expression "x:+/*/*/*" indicates that the evaluation should occur across multiple levels of nodes, effectively unwrapping nested structures. This is useful for dynamically resolving values in complex node hierarchies before further processing.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*
