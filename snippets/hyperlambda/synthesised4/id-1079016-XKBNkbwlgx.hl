/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves downwards in the Hyperlambda structure to the next node at the same hierarchical level. This is useful when you want to access the next node in sequence, which can be beneficial in scenarios where you need to compare or process sequential nodes.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - The first `*` retrieves all children nodes of the elder sibling node. This is useful for accessing all immediate children of a node, allowing you to perform operations or evaluations on them.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - The second `*` retrieves all children nodes of each child node obtained from the first `*`. This effectively allows you to access the grandchildren of the elder sibling node, which can be useful for deeper hierarchical data processing or transformations.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - The third `*` retrieves all children nodes of each grandchild node obtained from the second `*`. This allows you to access the great-grandchildren of the elder sibling node, enabling operations on even deeper nested data structures.
 * 
 * 5. `content` - This retrieves nodes specifically named "content" from the set of great-grandchildren nodes. It filters the nodes to only those with the name "content", which is useful when you are interested in processing or extracting data from nodes with this specific name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting or processing specific content from a deeply nested data structure where the content is located at a consistent depth relative to a sequence of nodes.
 * - Iterating over a set of sibling nodes and performing operations on their nested "content" nodes, such as aggregating data or applying transformations.
