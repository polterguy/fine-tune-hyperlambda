// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards through its ancestors. This is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate SQL-related data or commands stored in a node named "sql" within a larger Hyperlambda structure. A potential use case could be dynamically executing or modifying SQL queries stored in a Hyperlambda object.
