/*
 * 1. `@.connection`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "connection" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards through its ancestors and older siblings until it finds a match. This is useful for accessing configuration or context nodes that are defined earlier in the hierarchy, such as database connection settings or shared resources that need to be accessed by multiple parts of a Hyperlambda script. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a database connection string or configuration settings that are defined at the beginning of a script or in a parent node.
 * - Retrieving shared resources or settings that are used by multiple sibling nodes or child nodes within a script.
