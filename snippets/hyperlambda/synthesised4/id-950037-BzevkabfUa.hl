// This Hyperlambda code updates the total value of each item in a cart by adding the price of its components. The [set-value] slot changes the value of the [total] node for each item in the cart. The [math.add] slot calculates the new total by adding the current total to the price of each component, retrieved using [get-value]. The expression [x:@.cart/*/total] targets each item's total node, and [x:@.dp/#/*/price] retrieves the price of each component.
