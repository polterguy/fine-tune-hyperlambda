// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve nodes from a specified path in a Hyperlambda structure. It uses a lambda expression to point to the nodes under [hyper2lambda], effectively extracting all child nodes of [hyper2lambda]. This allows for manipulation or inspection of these nodes within the Hyperlambda execution context.
