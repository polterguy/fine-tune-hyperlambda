/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [case] slot to add nodes to a specified location in a Hyperlambda graph. It uses [add] to insert a [tokens] node with an integer value and a [chat] node with a boolean value as children of the node referenced by the expression in [add]. The [case] slot is typically used in conjunction with [switch] for conditional logic, but here it is used to structure data. 
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Begins a case block, often used with [switch].
 * 2. [add] - Adds nodes to a specified location in the graph.
 * 3. [tokens] - An integer node representing a token count.
 * 4. [chat] - A boolean node indicating a chat feature.
