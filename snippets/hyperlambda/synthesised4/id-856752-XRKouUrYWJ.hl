// This Hyperlambda code snippet modifies the value of the [.file-data] node by extracting a substring from it. The substring starts at index 1 and continues for a length calculated by subtracting 2 from the total length of [.file-data]. This effectively trims the first and last characters from the original [.file-data] string. The [set-value] slot is used to update the node's value with this new substring.
