// The code uses the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve nodes referenced by the expression. It specifically targets the node currently being iterated over in a [for-each] loop, accessed through the [.dp] reference, and retrieves its value as a node. This allows manipulation or inspection of the node's structure during iteration.
