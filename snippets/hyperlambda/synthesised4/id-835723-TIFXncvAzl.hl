/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds nodes retrieved from the [.arguments] node to a specific location within a data structure. The [add] slot is used to insert nodes at the path specified by its expression, while [get-nodes] retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node to be added. The operation effectively transfers nodes from one part of the graph to another. 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts nodes at the specified location in the data structure.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node to be added.
