// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the name of nodes found by the expression to "distinct_functor" and sets their value to a concatenated string. The string is constructed using the [strings.concat] slot, which combines the static text "count(distinct ", the value of the node referenced by [distinct_column], and a closing parenthesis. This is useful for dynamically generating SQL column names with distinct count functionality.
