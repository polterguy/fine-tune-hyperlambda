 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] to a specific location in the node hierarchy. The [get-nodes] slot fetches nodes from the [.arguments] node, and [add] inserts these nodes into the path specified by its expression, which is relative to the current node context. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified location in the node hierarchy.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node.
