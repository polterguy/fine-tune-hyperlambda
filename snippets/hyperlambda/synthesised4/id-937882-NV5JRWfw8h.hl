// The code uses the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve a subset of nodes from the [.arguments] node. It specifically targets the third node and continues to retrieve up to 1000 nodes from that point. This is useful for extracting a specific range of nodes from a larger collection.
get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/[2,1000]
