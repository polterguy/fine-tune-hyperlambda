/*
 * The [and] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate multiple conditions and will only return true if all of its conditions evaluate to true. It requires two or more arguments, each representing a condition. If any condition evaluates to false, the [and] slot will short-circuit, meaning it will stop evaluating further conditions and return false immediately. This allows for efficient evaluation of logical conditions. The [and] slot can be used in combination with other slots like [if] to create complex conditional logic in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Evaluates multiple conditions and returns true only if all conditions are true.
 * 2. [get-value:x:@.s1] - Retrieves the value of the [.s1] node.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.s2] - Retrieves the value of the [.s2] node.
 * 4. [if] - Checks if the conditions specified in the [and] slot are true.
 * 5. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the [if] condition is true.
 * 6. [set-value:x:@.res] - Sets the value of the [.res] node.
 * 7. [.:OK] - The value to set for the [.res] node if the [if] condition is true.
