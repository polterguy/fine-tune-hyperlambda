// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a loop that continues executing as long as the value of [.score] is less than 50. Within each iteration of the loop, it logs a message indicating that the score is being increased and then increments the [.score] value by 1. The [while] slot checks the condition using [lt] to determine if the loop should continue.
