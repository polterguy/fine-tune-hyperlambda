// This Hyperlambda code constructs a file path for storing a private key by concatenating a directory path, a fingerprint, and a file extension. It uses the [set-value] slot to assign the resulting string to [.private-key-filename], with [strings.concat] combining a static directory path, the fingerprint value, and a static file extension. The [get-value] slot retrieves the fingerprint value for inclusion in the file path.
