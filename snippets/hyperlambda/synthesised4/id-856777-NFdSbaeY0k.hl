// The provided Hyperlambda code executes two SQL DELETE statements using the [data.execute] slot. It deletes records from the "vss_ml_training_snippets" table based on a subquery selecting "rowid" from "ml_training_snippets" where "type" and "uri" match specified parameters. The second DELETE removes records directly from "ml_training_snippets" with the same conditions. The [data.execute] slot is used here because no result is expected from the operation.
data.execute:"\ndelete from vss_ml_training_snippets\nwhere rowid in (select id as rowid from ml_training_snippets where type = @type and uri like @uri);\ndelete from ml_training_snippets where type = @type and uri like @uri;"
