// The [invoke] slot in Hyperlambda is used to execute a lambda object, treating it like a dynamic slot, allowing you to pass arguments and return nodes. In this example, [invoke] executes the lambda object pointed to by the expression, using the node [slot] from [.arguments] as the lambda to invoke. The lambda object is executed immutably, meaning it cannot access or modify anything outside its own scope.
