/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [get-first-value] slot to return the first non-null value from its children nodes or the result of evaluating its expression. It attempts to retrieve the value of the [button] node from the [.arguments] node using [get-value]. If the [button] node is null or doesn't exist, it defaults to an empty value. 
 * 
 * 1. [get-first-value] - Returns the first non-null value from its children or expression.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [button] node from [.arguments].
 * 3. [.] - Provides a default empty value if [button] is null or doesn't exist.
