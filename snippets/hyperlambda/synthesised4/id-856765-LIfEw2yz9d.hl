// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert a new node into an existing node structure. Here, a node with the name [model_size] and an integer value of 128000 is added as a child to the node referenced by the expression [@.model]. The [add] slot facilitates the dynamic modification of node structures by appending new nodes to a specified parent node.
