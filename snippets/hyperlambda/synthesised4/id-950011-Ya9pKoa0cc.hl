// The code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes to a Hyperlambda structure by splitting a string value. It uses the [add] slot to insert nodes at a specific position, while [strings.split] is employed to divide the string at each comma, creating separate nodes for each segment. The [strings.split] slot operates on the value of the current node referenced by [.dp], ensuring the split values are added as new nodes.
