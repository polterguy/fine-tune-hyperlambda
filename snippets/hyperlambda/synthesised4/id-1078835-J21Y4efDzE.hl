/*
 * 1. `@.exists`: This iterator searches for the first node named "exists" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It will return the first node it finds with the name "exists". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to check if a node named "exists" is present in the ancestor hierarchy of the current node. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to ensure a certain configuration or state is present before proceeding with further operations.
