// The code checks if the value of [.failed] is greater than 0 using [mt]. If true, it sends a warning message through a socket signal to a specified feedback channel, indicating that some training snippets failed to vectorize and suggesting to try vectorizing again. The message and type are passed as arguments to the [sockets.signal] slot.
