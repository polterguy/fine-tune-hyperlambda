/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to convert a JSON string into a lambda object and then back into a JSON string. It uses the [json2lambda] slot to transform the JSON input into a lambda structure and the [lambda2json] slot to revert it back to JSON. This process is useful for manipulating JSON data within a Hyperlambda environment.
 * 
 * 1. [.json] - Declares a JSON string to be converted.
 * 2. [json2lambda] - Converts the JSON string into a lambda object.
 * 3. [lambda2json] - Converts the lambda object back into a JSON string.
