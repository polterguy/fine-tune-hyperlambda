/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda) of the current node. It is used to navigate to the next sibling node in the hierarchy.
 *    
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it will retrieve all children of the node that was selected by the `+` iterator.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator again retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It will retrieve all children of each node that was selected by the previous `*` iterator.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to navigate a hierarchical data structure where you need to process or evaluate all descendant nodes of the elder sibling of the current node. It could be useful in scenarios where you need to apply operations or extract information from a specific part of a data tree, such as in a configuration file or a document structure.
