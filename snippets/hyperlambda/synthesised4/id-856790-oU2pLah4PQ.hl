// The code iterates over each child node of the [signal] node using [for-each], and for each iteration, it adds nodes from the current [.dp] node to a specific path. The first [add] appends nodes from the [.dp] reference to the children of the current node, while the second [add] inserts nodes into a deeply nested path within the current [.dp] node, specifically targeting the [indexes] node under the first table's children.
