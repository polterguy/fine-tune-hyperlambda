// This Hyperlambda code snippet reads data from the "transactions" table and appends it to a node named [.transaction-history]. The [add] slot is used to append the result of the [data.read] operation, which retrieves data from the specified table, to the existing node structure. The [data.read] slot is responsible for executing a SQL SELECT operation on the "transactions" table.
