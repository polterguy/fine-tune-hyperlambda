// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. The [else] block is executed if none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are met. In this example, the [add] slot is used within the [else] block to add a node with the name [primary] and a boolean value of false to the children of the [.tmp] node. This ensures that the [primary] node is only added when all previous conditions are false.

   add:x:@.tmp/*
