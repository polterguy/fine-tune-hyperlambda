 * The code iterates over each child node of [.foo1] using [for-each], and for each of these nodes, it further iterates over their children. During each iteration of the inner loop, it logs the message "For each executed" using [log.info]. 
 * 
 * 1. [for-each:x:../*/.foo1/*] - Iterates over each child node of [.foo1].
 * 2. [for-each:x:@.dp/#/*] - Iterates over each child node of the currently iterated node from the outer loop.
 * 3. [log.info:For each executed] - Logs the message "For each executed" during each iteration of the inner loop.
