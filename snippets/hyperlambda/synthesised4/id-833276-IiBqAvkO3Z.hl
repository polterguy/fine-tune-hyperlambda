/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the HTTP GET request's status code is not between 200 and 299. If the condition is true, it converts the current lambda object to a Hyperlambda string, logs the information, and throws an exception with a message indicating an error during the SERP API invocation. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional statement.
 * 2. [not] - Inverts the condition of its child nodes.
 * 3. [and] - Combines multiple conditions, requiring all to be true.
 * 4. [mte] - Checks if the HTTP GET status code is more than or equal to 200.
 * 5. [lt] - Checks if the HTTP GET status code is less than 300.
 * 6. [.lambda] - Executes the following nodes if the condition is true.
 * 7. [lambda2hyper] - Converts the current lambda object to a Hyperlambda string.
 * 8. [log.info] - Logs the converted Hyperlambda string.
 * 9. [throw] - Throws an exception with a specified error message.
