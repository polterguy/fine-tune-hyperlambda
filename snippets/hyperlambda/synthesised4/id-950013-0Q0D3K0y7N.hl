// The code demonstrates how to perform SQL joins using Hyperlambda. It specifies an inner join between the "film" and "film_actor" tables on the "film_id" column, and another inner join between the "film_actor" and "actor" tables on the "actor_id" column. This structure allows for retrieving data from multiple related tables by defining join conditions.
join:film_actor
   type:inner
   on
      and
         film.film_id:film_actor.film_id
   join:actor
      type:inner
      on
         and
            film_actor.actor_id:actor.actor_id
