// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [yield] slot to return a list of nodes obtained from a [sort] operation. The [yield] slot is used to output the sorted nodes, where the [sort] slot sorts nodes based on a specified expression and lambda object. The [yield] slot ensures that the sorted result is returned as the output of the operation.
