// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [case] slot to check if a value is equal to 10. If the condition is met, it sets the value of the [.result] node to "Value is ten" using the [set-value] slot. The [case] slot is typically used within a [switch] construct to handle multiple conditions, but here it is used independently to demonstrate setting a value based on a specific condition.
case:int:10
   set-value:x:@.result
      .:Value is ten
