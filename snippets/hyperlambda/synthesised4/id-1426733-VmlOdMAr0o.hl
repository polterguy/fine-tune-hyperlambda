/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [completion] exists and is not null within the current context. It uses the [and] slot to ensure both conditions are true: [exists] verifies the presence of the [completion] node, and [not-null] confirms that the node has a non-null value. This is useful for validating that a specific node is present and contains meaningful data before proceeding with further operations. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Combines two conditions and evaluates to true only if both conditions are true.
 * 2. [exists] - Checks if the [completion] node exists in the current context.
 * 3. [not-null] - Checks if the [completion] node has a non-null value.
