// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to insert nodes into a specific location within a deeply nested node structure. It targets the [indexes] node within a sequence of [for-each] iterations, specifically under the [tables] node. The [add] operation is performed on the node set resulting from the expression, effectively modifying the structure by adding new nodes at the specified location. The use of multiple [for-each] slots indicates a complex iteration process to reach the desired insertion point.
