// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [folder] node by concatenating a series of strings. It uses [strings.concat] to combine a static path "/modules/", the first element from a split string operation, and a trailing slash "/", effectively constructing a folder path. The [set-value] slot assigns this concatenated string to the [folder] node.
