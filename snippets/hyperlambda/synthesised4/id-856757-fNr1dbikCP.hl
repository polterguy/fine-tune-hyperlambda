// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to insert nodes into a specified location within a node structure. The [add] slot targets the children of the [signal] node, inserting two new nodes: [uri] and [filename]. These nodes are assigned values derived from expressions pointing to [.uri] and [.filepath], respectively. This operation effectively adds the new nodes with their evaluated values as children of the [signal] node.
add:x:@signal/*
   .
      uri:x:@.uri
      filename:x:@.filepath
