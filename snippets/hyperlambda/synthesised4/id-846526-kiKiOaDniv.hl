// This Hyperlambda code snippet concatenates a series of strings to form a SQL query. It retrieves the current value of the [sql] node, appends the string " from ", followed by "Shippers", and finally " where keyword_count > 0", effectively constructing a SQL query string. The result is stored back in the [sql] node.
