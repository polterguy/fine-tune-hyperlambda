// The [type] slot in Hyperlambda is used to retrieve the type name of a specified node's value. By invoking [type] with an expression pointing to a node, it returns the Hyperlambda type of that node's value. This is useful for dynamically determining the type of data being handled in a Hyperlambda script.
