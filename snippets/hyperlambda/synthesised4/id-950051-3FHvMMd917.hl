// Iterates through each file in a specified directory and checks if the file name ends with ".txt". If true, it increments the value of a node [.no] by one. This effectively counts the number of text files in the directory. The [for-each] slot iterates over the files, [if] checks the file extension, and [math.increment] updates the count.
