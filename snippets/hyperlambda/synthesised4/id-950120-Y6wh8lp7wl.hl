/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates a [while] loop that continues executing as long as the value of [.value] is less than 15. Within the loop, it logs an informational message "Increasing value" and increments the [.value] by 1 using [math.increment]. The loop will terminate once [.value] reaches 15.
 * 
 * 1. [while] - Initiates a loop that continues as long as its condition is true.
 * 2. [lt] - Compares if the value of [.value] is less than 15.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the current value of [.value].
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the actions to perform during each iteration of the loop.
 * 5. [log.info] - Logs the message "Increasing value" during each iteration.
 * 6. [math.increment] - Increments the value of [.value] by 1 during each iteration.
