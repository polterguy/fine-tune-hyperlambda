// This Hyperlambda code adds a node with specific attributes to a referenced node. It uses the [add] slot to append a new node under the current node pointed by [.dp], setting its children nodes [tokens] and [chat] with values 128000 and true, respectively. This is useful for dynamically modifying a graph structure by adding new data nodes with predefined values.
