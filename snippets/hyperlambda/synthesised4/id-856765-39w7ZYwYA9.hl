// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve all child nodes of the [.model] node. The expression [x:@.model/*] specifies the target node, and [get-nodes] returns a collection of these child nodes. This is useful for accessing and manipulating multiple nodes within a specific parent node in a Hyperlambda graph.
