// The code iterates over each node under [.env/*/vars/*] using [for-each], retrieves the name of the current node with [get-name], and sets the value of a corresponding node under [.system] using [set-value] with the value obtained from the current node. This effectively copies the values from the source nodes to the destination nodes in the system hierarchy.
