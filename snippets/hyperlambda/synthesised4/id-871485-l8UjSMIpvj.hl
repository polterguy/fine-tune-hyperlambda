// This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database named "hospital" and performs an SQL query on the "Doctors" table. It dynamically constructs an aggregate function using the provided arguments, removes certain nodes, and adds conditions to the query. The query retrieves a single aggregated result, which is then returned. The key slots are: [data.connect] for establishing the connection, [set-name] for constructing the aggregate function, [remove-nodes] for modifying the node structure, [add] for appending conditions, [data.read] for executing the query, and [return-nodes] for returning the result.
