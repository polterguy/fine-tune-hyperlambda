// This Hyperlambda code calculates a weighted sum of scores by multiplying logic and creativity scores with their respective weights and then adding the results. The [math.multiply] slots perform the multiplication of scores and weights, while the [math.add] slot sums the two products to produce a final result. The use of [get-value] expressions retrieves the necessary values for these calculations.
