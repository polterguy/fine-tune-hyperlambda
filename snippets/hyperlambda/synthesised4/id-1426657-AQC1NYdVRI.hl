// This Hyperlambda code defines a signal named [magic.http.get-with-cache] that retrieves a resource from a specified URL using HTTP GET. If the resource is cached, it returns the cached version; otherwise, it fetches the resource, caches it, and then returns it. The signal uses [cache.get] to check for a cached item and [http.get] to fetch the resource if not cached. The result is returned with the HTTP status code, headers, and content.
