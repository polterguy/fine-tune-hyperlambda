// This Hyperlambda code snippet dynamically adds nodes from a source to a destination. It uses [add] to append nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] from [@.tmp/*] into the children of all nodes matching the expression [../*/mssql.connect/*/return-nodes]. This effectively copies nodes from a temporary location to multiple destinations within a Microsoft SQL Server connection context.
