// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to update records in a database table named "users" using the [data.update] slot. It specifies the table to update with the [table] node, and the [values] node is intended to contain the column-value pairs to be updated. The [where] node, combined with the [and] logical condition, is used to define the criteria for selecting which records to update, ensuring that only specific records meeting the condition are modified.
