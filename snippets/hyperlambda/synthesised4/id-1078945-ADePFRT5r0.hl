/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a Hyperlambda function or HTTP endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access the individual argument nodes within the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `user_id` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "user_id". It is used to specifically access the "user_id" argument from the list of arguments.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function or HTTP endpoint to retrieve the value of the "user_id" argument passed to it. This is useful in scenarios where you need to perform operations based on the user's identity, such as fetching user-specific data or performing authorization checks.
