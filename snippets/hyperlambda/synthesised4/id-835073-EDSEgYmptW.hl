// This Hyperlambda code reads data from the "users_crypto_keys" table, specifically selecting the "username" column. It applies a condition to filter results where the "key_id" is equal to the "id" from another data reading operation. The [where] clause uses an [and] condition to ensure the "key_id" matches the specified criteria, allowing for precise data retrieval based on dynamic parameters.
