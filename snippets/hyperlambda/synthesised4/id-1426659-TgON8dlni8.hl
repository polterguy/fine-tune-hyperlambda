 * /*
 *  * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a block of code when previous conditional checks fail. 
 *  * In this example, the [else] block is used to set the value of the [url] node. 
 *  * The value is retrieved using the [get-value] slot, which accesses a specific node in the hierarchy based on the provided expression.
 *  * The expression navigates through the node structure to find the desired [href] attribute.
 *  * 
 *  * 1. [else] - Executes the following block of code if previous conditions are not met.
 *  * 2. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [url] node.
 *  * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a node specified by the expression.
