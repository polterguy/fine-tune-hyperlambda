// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a conditional check using [if] and [lt] to compare the lengths of two strings. If the length of the string pointed to by [.lhs] is less than the length of the string pointed to by [.rhs], it sets the value of [.result] to -1. The code uses [strings.length] to obtain the lengths of the strings for comparison.
