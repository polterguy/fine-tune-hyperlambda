/*
 * 1. `@.no-dynamic-slots`: This iterator is used to find the first node that matches the name "no-dynamic-slots" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that the search should begin from the current node and look for a sibling or ancestor node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate a specific node within a larger structure without traversing the entire hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to check or modify a configuration or setting represented by the "no-dynamic-slots" node, ensuring that dynamic slots are not being used or are disabled in a particular context.
