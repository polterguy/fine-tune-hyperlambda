/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named `.dp` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the `.dp` node found in the previous step. It assumes that the value of the `.dp` node is another node, effectively allowing you to work with the referenced node directly.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous step. It allows you to access every child node under the de-referenced node.
 * 
 * 4. `consumes` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `consumes` from the children nodes obtained in the previous step.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to find and work with specific configuration or metadata nodes within a larger data structure, especially if `.dp` is a dynamic parameter or context node containing various settings or information.
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you need to process or validate specific types of data (e.g., API consumption details) that are stored under a `.dp` node structure.
