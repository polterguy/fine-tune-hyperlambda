/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" from the current context. It is often used to access a specific node that is expected to be present in the hierarchy, commonly used in loops or dynamic slot executions where ".dp" represents the current node being processed.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator. In this context, it assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is another node itself, allowing direct access to this referenced node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node obtained from the previous step. It is used to access all direct descendants of the node, which is useful for iterating over or processing multiple child nodes.
 * 
 * 4. `status` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "status". It is used to pinpoint specific nodes of interest from the children retrieved by the `*` iterator, allowing operations or checks to be performed specifically on nodes with this name.
