/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before in its hierarchy that matches the given name. In this case, it will look for the first ancestor node named "sql". It is useful when you want to access a specific node that is not a direct child or sibling but is somewhere up in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression can be used to access a configuration or query node named "sql" that might be defined higher up in the hierarchy, allowing for modular and reusable code where SQL queries or configurations are defined once and used in multiple places.
