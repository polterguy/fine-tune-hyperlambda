// The code snippet demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement to handle different HTTP response status codes from a [http.get] request. It sets the value of [.weather.result] based on the status code: [case] 200 indicates successful XML data retrieval, [case] 406 throws an exception for unacceptable XML response, and [default] handles any other status by indicating failure to fetch data.
switch:x:@http.get
   case:int:200
      set-value:x:@.weather.result
         .:Weather data received in XML format
   case:int:406
      throw:406 Not Acceptable â€“ Server cannot return XML
   default
      set-value:x:@.weather.result
         .:Unable to fetch weather data
