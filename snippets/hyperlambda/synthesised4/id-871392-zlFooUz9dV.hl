// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database using the [data.read] slot. It specifies the database type as SQLite and targets the "Regions" table. The code uses a column aliasing technique to rename the column result using [distinct_functor] with an alias of ".". The [where] clause is prepared for additional conditions using the [and] logical operator, although no specific conditions are provided in this snippet.
