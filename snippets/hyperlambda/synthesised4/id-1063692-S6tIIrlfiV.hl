/*
 * 1. `@data.read` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "data.read" from the current context. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary, but does not traverse siblings.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.read" node. It collects all direct child nodes without filtering by name or value.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children of each node returned by the previous `*` iterator. This effectively gathers all grandchildren of the "data.read" node, allowing you to access nodes two levels deep from the original "data.read" node.
