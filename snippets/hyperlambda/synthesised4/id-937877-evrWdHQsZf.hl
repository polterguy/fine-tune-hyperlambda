// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database using a generic or magic connection, adds nodes to the "where" clause of a "data.delete" operation from the provided arguments, and deletes records from the "roles" table based on the constructed "where" clause. It then unwraps the results and returns the number of affected rows from the delete operation. The key slots used are [data.connect] for establishing the database connection, [add] for modifying the "where" clause, [data.delete] for performing the deletion, [unwrap] for evaluating expressions, and [return] for outputting the result.
