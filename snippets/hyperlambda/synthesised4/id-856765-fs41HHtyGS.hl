/*
 * This Hyperlambda code calculates the maximum context and request tokens for a model by first subtracting a specified number from the model's maximum tokens, dividing the result by 2, and then setting the calculated value as both the maximum context and request tokens for the model. The [math.subtract] slot is used to perform the subtraction, and [math.divide] is used to divide the result. The [set-value] slot assigns the calculated values to the respective nodes. 
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Specifies the model version being used.
 * 2. [math.subtract] - Subtracts 2 from the model's maximum tokens.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the model's maximum tokens.
 * 4. [math.divide] - Divides the result of the subtraction by 2.
 * 5. [set-value] - Sets the calculated value as the maximum context tokens.
 * 6. [get-value] - Retrieves the result of the division.
 * 7. [set-value] - Sets the calculated value as the maximum request tokens.
 * 8. [get-value] - Retrieves the result of the division again for the second assignment.
