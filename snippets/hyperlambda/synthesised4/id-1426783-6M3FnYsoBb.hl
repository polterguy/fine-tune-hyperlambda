 * // This Hyperlambda code uses the [mt] slot to check if the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.tmp] is more than 0. If the condition is true, it will return true. 
 * // 1. [mt] - Compares two values and returns true if the first value is more than the second.
 * // 2. [x:@.tmp] - Expression pointing to the node whose value is being compared.
 * // 3. [.:int:0] - The static integer value 0, which is the second argument in the comparison.
