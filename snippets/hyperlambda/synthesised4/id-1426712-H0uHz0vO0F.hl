// The Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate a nested expression that traverses multiple levels of nodes to access the 'content' node. The [unwrap] slot is used to forward evaluate the expression, ensuring that the 'content' node's value is retrieved and processed before the execution reaches the node where [unwrap] is invoked. This allows for dynamic evaluation and manipulation of node values within a Hyperlambda graph.
