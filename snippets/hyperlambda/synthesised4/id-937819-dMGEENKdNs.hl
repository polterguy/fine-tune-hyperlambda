// This Hyperlambda code defines a [case] block that triggers when an integer value of 406 is encountered. Within this block, the [throw] slot is used to raise an exception with the message "406 Not Acceptable – Server cannot return XML". This setup is typically used in a [switch] statement to handle specific error conditions gracefully by throwing exceptions with descriptive messages.
case:int:406
   throw:406 Not Acceptable – Server cannot return XML
