/*
 * 1. `@json2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named "json2lambda" in the current context. It is typically used to locate a specific node by name, which might represent a section or a module in the Hyperlambda graph.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "json2lambda" node. It is useful for accessing all elements or configurations that are directly under the "json2lambda" node.
 * 
 * 3. `magic` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "magic" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to narrow down the search to specific nodes that match the given name.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "magic" node. It allows access to all elements or configurations that are directly under the "magic" node.
 * 
 * 5. `databases` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "databases" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically locate nodes related to database configurations or settings within the "magic" section.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve database configuration nodes from a JSON-to-Hyperlambda transformation process, where the data is structured under a "json2lambda" root and organized into sections like "magic" and "databases".
 * - It can also be useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically access and manipulate database settings or configurations that are part of a larger Hyperlambda structure.
