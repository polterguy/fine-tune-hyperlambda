// Creates a dynamic slot named "foo" that returns a static string value when invoked. The [return-value] slot is used to specify what the slot should return, and this slot can be invoked using [signal] or [execute]. The slot is not persisted, so it will be removed if the server restarts.
slots.create:foo
   return-value:This becomes the returned value from your slot
