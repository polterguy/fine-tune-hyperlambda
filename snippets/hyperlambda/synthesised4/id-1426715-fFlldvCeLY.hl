/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions. The first condition checks if the value of the [max_requests] node inside the [model] node is not equal to -1 using the [neq] slot. The second condition checks if the value of the [no_requests] node inside the [model] node is more than or equal to the value of the [max_requests] node using the [mte] slot. The [and] slot will return true only if both conditions are true. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Combines two conditions and returns true if both are true.
 * 2. [neq] - Checks if the value of [max_requests] is not equal to -1.
 * 3. [mte] - Checks if [no_requests] is more than or equal to [max_requests].
