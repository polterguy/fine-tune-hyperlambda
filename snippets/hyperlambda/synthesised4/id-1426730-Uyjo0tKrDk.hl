/*
 * This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the second node resulting from a [strings.split] operation. The [get-value] slot is used with an expression pointing to the first child of the [strings.split] node, effectively extracting the value of the second split segment. 
 * 
 * 1. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node its expression is pointing to.
 * 2. [x:@strings.split/1] - Expression pointing to the second node resulting from a [strings.split] operation.
