// The Hyperlambda code uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a signal to all connections associated with the current session. It includes an [args] node with a single argument [function_waiting] set to a boolean value of true, which will be transmitted as a JSON object to the subscribers. This allows for real-time communication with clients connected to the session, notifying them that a particular function is waiting or ready to execute.
