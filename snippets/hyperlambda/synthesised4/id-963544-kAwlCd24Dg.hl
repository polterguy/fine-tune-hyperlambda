// This Hyperlambda code iterates over a dataset using [for-each], constructing a personalized HTML message for each entry using [strings.concat]. The message includes a greeting with the recipient's name and a promotional paragraph. The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate the concatenated string, which is then sent as an HTML email using [mail.smtp.send]. The email is sent from a predefined FitPulse Coach address to each recipient's email, with a subject encouraging fitness with FitPulse. The slots involved are: [for-each], [strings.concat], [unwrap], and [mail.smtp.send].
