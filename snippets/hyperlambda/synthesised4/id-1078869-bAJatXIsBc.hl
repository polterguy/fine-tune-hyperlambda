/*
 * 1. `@execute` - This iterator searches for the first node named "execute" in the current context. It is used to locate the specific node from which further navigation will occur.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "execute" node. It allows access to any nodes nested directly under the "execute" node.
 * 
 * 3. `ticket` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "ticket" from the children nodes of the "execute" node. It ensures that only nodes with the specific name "ticket" are selected.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access or manipulate data related to a "ticket" that is a child of an "execute" node. For example, it might be used in a system that processes or logs ticket information after executing a particular operation.
