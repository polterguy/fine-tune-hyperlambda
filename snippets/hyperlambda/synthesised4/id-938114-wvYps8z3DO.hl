// This Hyperlambda code sets HTTP response headers to specify the content type as XML and indicates that the content should be treated as an attachment with the filename "file.xml". The [response.headers.set] slot is used to configure these headers, ensuring that the response is correctly interpreted by the client as an XML file attachment.
