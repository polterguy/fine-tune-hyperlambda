// The code snippet demonstrates how to send a socket signal using the [sockets.signal] slot. It targets a session specified by the expression in its value. The [args] node contains a [message] node, which is populated by converting JSON content into a lambda object using the [json2lambda] slot. This setup allows for dynamic message content to be transmitted over a socket connection.
sockets.signal:x:@.session
   args
      message:x:@json2lambda/*/message/*/content
