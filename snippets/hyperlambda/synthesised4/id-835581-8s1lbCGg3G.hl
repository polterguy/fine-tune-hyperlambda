// This Hyperlambda code snippet modifies the names of nodes under the path [./*/data.read/*/columns/*/aggregate_functor] by setting them to a concatenated string. The concatenation is formed by retrieving the values of [aggregate_function] and [aggregate_column] from the [.arguments] node, and placing them within parentheses. This effectively creates a new name for the nodes, combining the function and column names into a single string representation.
