// The code snippet uses the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] from the result of a [csv2lambda] invocation into a specific location within a lambda object. This effectively integrates the CSV-converted data into a designated node path, enhancing the data structure with new elements. The [get-nodes] slot is used to fetch the nodes resulting from the [csv2lambda] operation, which converts CSV data into a lambda object format.
