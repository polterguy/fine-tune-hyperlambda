/*
 * The code lists all files in the "/etc/system/openai/temp/" directory and deletes each file except "README.md". It then lists all folders in the same directory and deletes each one. The [else] block ensures this cleanup process occurs only if previous conditions in the conditional branching were not met. 
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes the following nodes if none of its elder siblings' conditions are true.
 * 2. [io.file.list] - Lists all files in the specified directory.
 * 3. [for-each] - Iterates over each file listed.
 * 4. [if] - Checks if the current file is not "README.md".
 * 5. [neq] - Compares the current file path to "README.md".
 * 6. [io.file.delete] - Deletes the current file if it is not "README.md".
 * 7. [io.folder.list] - Lists all folders in the specified directory.
 * 8. [for-each] - Iterates over each folder listed.
 * 9. [io.folder.delete] - Deletes the current folder.
