// The code uses the [mt] slot to compare the token count of a JSON representation of a lambda object, obtained via [openai.tokenize], against a maximum context token value retrieved from the [.arguments] node. If the token count is greater than the maximum allowed, the condition evaluates to true. The slots involved are [mt], [openai.tokenize], and [get-value].
