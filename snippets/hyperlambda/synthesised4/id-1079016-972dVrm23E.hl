/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "new-prompt" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary, but it does not traverse siblings. This is useful for retrieving a specific node when you know its name and want to access its value or children nodes. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or settings stored in a node named "new-prompt".
 * - Retrieving user input or data stored under a node named "new-prompt" for further processing.
