// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.api-key] node by retrieving the value of the [api_key] node from within the [data.read] node's hierarchy. The [set-value] slot changes the value of the [.api-key] node to the result of the [get-value] slot, which fetches the value of the [api_key] node.
