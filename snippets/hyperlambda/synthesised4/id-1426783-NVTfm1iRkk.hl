/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of a node named [workflow] that is a child of the node resulting from the [execute] slot. The [get-value] slot is used to access the value of the specified node, which is identified through the lambda expression provided. The lambda expression navigates through the node structure, starting from the [execute] node and accessing its children to find the [workflow] node. This operation is useful for extracting specific data from a complex node structure.
 * // 1. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression.
 * // 2. [x:@execute/*/workflow] - Lambda expression pointing to the [workflow] node, which is a child of the node resulting from the [execute] slot.
