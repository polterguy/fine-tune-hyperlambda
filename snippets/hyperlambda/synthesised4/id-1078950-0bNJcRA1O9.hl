/*
 * 1. `@.begin`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "begin" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates that it should look for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it should start the search from the current node's position in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve a specific configuration or initialization node named "begin" that is required to set up the context for the current operation.
 * - It might be used in a scenario where multiple operations need to reference a common starting point or setup node within a complex hierarchical structure.
