/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement. This structure allows for conditional branching based on the value of a given expression. Each [case] slot specifies a potential match value, and if the expression matches this value, the corresponding block of code is executed. If no [case] matches, the [default] block is executed. This is useful for executing different code paths based on specific conditions or values. The code includes the following slots:
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Initiates a switch statement for conditional branching.
 * 2. [case] - Defines a condition to match against the switch expression.
 * 3. [default] - Provides a fallback execution path if no [case] matches.
