 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name that appears before it in the hierarchy. In this case, it looks for the first node named "user-id" in the current context.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to fetch the value of a "user-id" node, which might be necessary for operations like user authentication, authorization, or logging user-specific actions.
