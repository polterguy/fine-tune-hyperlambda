/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful for navigating up the hierarchy to access the parent node and its siblings or other ancestors.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access all nodes directly under the node returned by the previous iterator.
 * 3. `data.create` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "data.create". It is used to narrow down the selection to specific nodes of interest.
 * 4. `*` - This iterator, again, retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set, allowing access to nodes nested within the "data.create" nodes.
 * 5. `values` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "values". It is used to further narrow down the selection to nodes specifically named "values" within the previously retrieved nodes.
