// 1. `@.from`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "from" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches through siblings and ancestors, moving upwards in the structure until it finds a match. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is known to exist earlier in the hierarchy, such as retrieving a sender's information in a messaging system where the "from" node contains the sender's details.
