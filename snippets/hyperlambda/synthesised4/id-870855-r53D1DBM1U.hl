// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes from one source to a destination. It retrieves nodes from the [attachments] node under [.arguments] and adds them to the children collection of the [.entity] node. The [get-nodes] slot is used to specify which nodes to retrieve and add.
add:x:@.entity/*
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/attachments/*
