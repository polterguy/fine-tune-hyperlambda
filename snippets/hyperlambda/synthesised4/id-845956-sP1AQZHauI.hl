/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a request with a specific ID has been previously executed, indicating a potential replay attack. It uses [signal] to verify the invocation status of a request ID, and if true, concatenates a warning message using [strings.concat] and throws an exception with [throw] to abort execution. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional check.
 * 2. [signal] - Checks if a request with a specific ID has been previously invoked.
 * 3. [request-id] - Specifies the request ID to check for previous execution.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Executes the following nodes if the condition is true.
 * 5. [strings.concat] - Concatenates a warning message indicating a replay attack.
 * 6. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the request ID.
 * 7. [throw] - Throws an exception with the concatenated message to abort execution.
