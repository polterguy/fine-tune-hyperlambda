// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to update records in a SQLite database table named "questionnaires". It specifies the database type as SQLite and includes a placeholder for the values to be updated. The [where] clause uses an [and] condition to determine which records should be updated, ensuring that only specific records meeting certain criteria are modified.
