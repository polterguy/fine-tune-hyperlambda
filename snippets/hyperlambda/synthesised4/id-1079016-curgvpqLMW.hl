/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It is used to move downwards in the hierarchy to the next node at the same level. This is useful when you want to access the next sibling node in a sequence of nodes.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. After moving to the elder sibling with the `+` iterator, this `*` will gather all the direct children of that sibling node. This is useful for operations where you need to process or evaluate all children of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children of the nodes obtained from the previous `*` iterator. This allows you to access a deeper level of the hierarchy, specifically the grandchildren of the elder sibling node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in scenarios where you need to process or evaluate data at a specific hierarchical level, such as gathering all descendant nodes of a particular sibling node for further operations or transformations. For example, in a configuration file, you might want to apply settings to all sub-elements of a specific sibling node.
