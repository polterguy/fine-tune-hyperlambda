/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful for accessing the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `.arguments` node. It allows you to access each argument passed to the function or slot, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `/to` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `to` among the children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to specifically target an argument named `to`, which might represent a destination or target in the context of the function or slot.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function or slot to retrieve a specific argument named `to`, which might represent a recipient in a messaging system or a destination in a routing configuration.
