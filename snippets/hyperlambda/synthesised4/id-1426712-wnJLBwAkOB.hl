/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and process all descendant nodes of the [return] node, starting from the current node's children. The [unwrap] slot is used to forward evaluate expressions, allowing the code to dynamically resolve and execute expressions before the [return] node is reached. This is useful for dynamically constructing or modifying the node structure before further processing or returning the result. 
 * 
 * 1. [unwrap] - Evaluates all descendant nodes of the [return] node starting from the current node's children.
