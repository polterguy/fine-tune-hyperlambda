// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "sql" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. This is useful for accessing a specific node that has already been defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure, allowing you to reference its value or children nodes. This is particularly helpful when you want to reuse or manipulate data or configurations that have been set up previously in your Hyperlambda code.
