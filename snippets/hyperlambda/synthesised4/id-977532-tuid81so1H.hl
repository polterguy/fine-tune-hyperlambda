// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using the [data.read] slot with a left join between the "media" and "posts" tables in a SQLite database. It specifies the columns to be selected, including those from the "media" table and the "post_id" alias for the "posts" table, and sets up a join condition based on matching "post_id" fields. The [where] slot is prepared for additional filtering conditions.
