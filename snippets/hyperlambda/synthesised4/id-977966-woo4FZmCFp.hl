// The [unwrap] slot in this code is used to forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied as a value to unwrap itself. The expression [x:@.config-copy/**] specifies that all descendant nodes of the [.config-copy] node should be evaluated before the execution reaches the node where [unwrap] is referenced. This is useful for preparing or transforming data in advance of further processing.
unwrap:x:@.config-copy/**
