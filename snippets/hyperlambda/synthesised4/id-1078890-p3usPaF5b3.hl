 * 1. `@.page-header`: This iterator searches for the first node named `page-header` within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `page-header` node. The `*` symbol is used to access all children nodes, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access and manipulate all child elements of a `page-header` node, which might be useful in scenarios where you need to apply a transformation or extract information from each child node of a page header in a document or web page structure.
