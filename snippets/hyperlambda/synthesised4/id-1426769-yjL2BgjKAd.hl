 * // This Hyperlambda code uses the [else] slot to execute a block of code if all preceding [if] and [else-if] conditions evaluate to false. In this case, it adds a new node with the name "primary" and a boolean value of false to the node set referenced by the expression in [add]. The [else] slot does not require a condition and directly executes its child nodes.
 * // 1. [else] - Executes the following block if previous conditions are false.
 * // 2. [add] - Adds a new node to the specified node set.
 * // 3. [.] - Represents the new node to be added.
 * // 4. [primary] - The name of the new node being added.
 * // 5. [bool:false] - The value of the new node, indicating a boolean false.
