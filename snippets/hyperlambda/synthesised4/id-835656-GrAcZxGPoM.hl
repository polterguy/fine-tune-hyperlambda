// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to append nodes to a node collection. It retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node using [get-nodes] for both [order] and [direction], and appends these nodes to the [data.read] node. The [add] slot is used to modify the structure of the node graph by adding nodes dynamically based on the specified expressions.
add:x:./*/data.read
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/order
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/direction
