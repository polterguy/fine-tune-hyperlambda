// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Orders" and "Shippers", using an alias "ShipVia" for the "Shippers" table. The join condition is specified to match the "ShipVia" column from the "Orders" table with the "ShipperID" column from the "Shippers" table.
join:Shippers
   as:ShipVia
   type:left
   on
      and
         Orders.ShipVia:ShipVia.ShipperID
