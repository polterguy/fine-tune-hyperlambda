/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator looks for the first node named "result" within the current context. It starts from the current node and traverses upwards through the hierarchy to find a node with the name "result". This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the value of a node named "result" that might be defined earlier in the hierarchy or at the same level but before the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the result of a computation or operation that was stored in a node named "result".
 * - Accessing a previously set value in a node named "result" to use it in further calculations or logic.
