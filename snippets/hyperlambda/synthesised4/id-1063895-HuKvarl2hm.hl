// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node with the name "sql" that is a sibling or a parent of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it should look for a node with the specified name, and the `.` signifies that it should start from the current node and move upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful for retrieving a specific node that might be defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure, allowing you to access its value or children for further processing.
