// The [return-nodes] slot is used to return a collection of nodes from a dynamic slot or a context that supports returning nodes. The expression [x:@data.read/*/*] specifies the nodes to be returned, which in this case are all the child nodes of the nodes under [data.read]. This is useful for dynamically returning a subset of nodes from a larger data structure.
