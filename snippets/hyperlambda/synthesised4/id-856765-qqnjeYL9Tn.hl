// The code demonstrates the usage of the [case] slot in Hyperlambda, which is part of a switch-case construct. It allows for conditional execution based on matching a value against multiple cases. Each [case] slot can have a value to match against, and if a match is found, the associated lambda object is executed. If no match is found, the [default] slot is executed if provided. This construct is useful for branching logic based on discrete values.
