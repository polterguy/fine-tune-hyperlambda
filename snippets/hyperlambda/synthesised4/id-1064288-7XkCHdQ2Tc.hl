/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument that has been passed to a function or slot. The `*` symbol signifies that it will return all direct children nodes, allowing for operations or evaluations on each argument node.
