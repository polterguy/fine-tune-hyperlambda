/*
 * This Hyperlambda code retrieves and returns all nodes that are children of the [.meta] node. The [get-nodes] slot is used to reference and return the nodes specified by its expression. In this case, the expression [@.meta/*] points to all direct children of the [.meta] node, effectively returning those nodes as a result.
 * 
 * 1. [get-nodes] - Retrieves and returns the nodes specified by its expression.
 * 2. [@.meta/*] - An expression pointing to all children nodes of the [.meta] node.
