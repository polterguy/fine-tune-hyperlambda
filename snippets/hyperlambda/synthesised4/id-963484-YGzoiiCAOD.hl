// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [if] slot to conditionally execute a block of code based on the evaluation of a condition. The [eq] slot checks if the value of [.flag] is equal to boolean true. If the condition is met, the [.lambda] block is executed, logging an informational message indicating that [.flag] is enabled. The structure highlights conditional execution in Hyperlambda using [if] and [eq] for equality comparison.
