// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database table named "Categories" using the [data.read] slot. It specifies a distinct function as a column with an alias "count" and applies a [where] clause with an [and] condition, allowing for filtering of the data based on multiple criteria. The [database-type] is set to "sqlite", indicating the type of database being queried.
