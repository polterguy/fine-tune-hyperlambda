/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument passed to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `starts_with` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "starts_with". It is used to find a specific argument named "starts_with" within the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to check if an argument named "starts_with" has been provided, allowing the function to perform operations based on this specific argument.
 * - It could be used in a validation routine to ensure that a required argument named "starts_with" is present before proceeding with further logic.
