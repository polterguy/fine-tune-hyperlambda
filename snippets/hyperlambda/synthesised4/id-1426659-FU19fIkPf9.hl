/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the value of the [.url] node to the value obtained from the first [href] attribute of the node currently being iterated over, which is passed by reference as [.dp]. The [get-value] slot retrieves this value using a complex expression that navigates through the node structure. The [set-value] slot then assigns this retrieved value to [.url]. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.url] node.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value from the specified expression.
 * 3. [@.dp/#/./*/\\@href/[0,1]] - Expression that navigates through the node structure to find the first [href] attribute.
