/*
 * 1. `@data.connect`: This iterator searches for the first node named `data.connect` in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards through the hierarchy until it finds a node with this name. This is useful for referencing a specific node that acts as a connection or initialization point for data operations.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `data.connect` node. It allows you to access any nodes that are directly under `data.connect`, which might contain specific configurations or parameters needed for further operations.
 * 
 * 3. `data.execute`: This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes named `data.execute` among the children of `data.connect`. This is typically used to find nodes that represent executable actions or commands related to the data connection, such as executing a query or a command on a database.
