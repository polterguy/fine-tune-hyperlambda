// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and forward the expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. It takes the expression "x:+/*/*" and evaluates it, effectively unwrapping the values of the nodes it points to, allowing for their values to be used or modified before the execution reaches the node where [unwrap] is invoked. This is useful for pre-evaluating expressions within a lambda object, ensuring that the values are ready for use when the lambda object is executed.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
