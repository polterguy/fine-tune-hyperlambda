/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type name of a node's value. It first sets a node [.foo] with an integer value of 57 and then uses the [type] slot to obtain the type of the value in the node directly above it. The result of invoking [type] will be the type name of the value in [.foo], which is "int".
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type name of the value in the node directly above it.
