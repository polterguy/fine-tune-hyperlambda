// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [else] slot to execute a block of code if all preceding conditions are false. Within this block, it uses [set-value] to change the value of the [result] node by replacing occurrences of the string "[[chat]]" with "false" using the [strings.replace] slot. The [else] slot ensures that this replacement only occurs when prior conditions are not met.
