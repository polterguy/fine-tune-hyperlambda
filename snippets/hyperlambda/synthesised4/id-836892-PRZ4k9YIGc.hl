// This Hyperlambda code adds nodes retrieved from the [.arguments] node to a specific location within a data structure. It uses [add] to insert these nodes at the path specified by the expression in its value, which targets the [where] node within a [data.read] operation. The [get-nodes] slot fetches all nodes under [.arguments], allowing dynamic modification of the data structure based on the arguments provided.
