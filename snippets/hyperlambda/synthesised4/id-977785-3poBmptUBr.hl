// The code snippet retrieves the content from an HTTP POST response and assigns it to a node named [crmResponse]. It uses the [return] slot to output the value, which is extracted using a lambda expression that navigates through the response structure to access the desired content. The [http.post] slot is expected to have been executed prior, and its response is accessed via the expression.
