// This Hyperlambda code snippet appends a primary key definition to an existing SQL string. It uses [set-value] to modify the [sql] node by concatenating its current value with a formatted primary key string. The [strings.concat] slot combines the existing SQL string with a new string that includes a primary key declaration, where [get-value] retrieves the trimmed value to be used as the primary key column name. This operation is useful for dynamically constructing SQL statements with primary key constraints.
