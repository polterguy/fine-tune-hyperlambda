// This Hyperlambda code snippet continuously checks if the value of [.temp] is more than 100 using the [mt] slot. If true, it executes the [.lambda] block, adding a log entry "Cooling system active" to [.log] and decrements [.temp] by 1 using [math.decrement]. This loop continues until [.temp] is no longer greater than 100.
