// This Hyperlambda code connects to a CMS database using SQLite, dynamically adds conditions to a delete operation, deletes records from the "pages" table based on these conditions, and returns the number of affected rows. It utilizes [data.connect] to establish a connection, [add] to append conditions, [data.delete] to perform the deletion, [unwrap] to evaluate expressions, and [return] to output the result.
