// The code uses the [remove-nodes] slot to delete nodes from the result of a [strings.split] operation. It targets nodes within a specific range, from the 15th to the 20th node, in the split result. This is useful for cleaning up or managing node sets by removing unwanted nodes after splitting a string into multiple parts.
