/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a new node to the [.session] node. The new node contains a [.role] node with the value "system" and a [.content] node whose value is retrieved from the [signal/*/context] node. This operation is typically used to append additional information to a session, possibly for tracking or context purposes. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts a new node into the [.session] node.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the new node being added.
 * 3. [role] - Sets the role of the new node to "system".
 * 4. [content] - Retrieves and sets the content from the [signal/*/context] node.
