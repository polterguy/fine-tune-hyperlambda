/*
 * - `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by selecting the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for the first matching node in the hierarchy.
 * - `*`: This iterator selects all children of the `.arguments` node. It essentially expands the selection to include every direct child node under `.arguments`.
 * - `stream`: This iterator filters the previously selected nodes to only include those named `stream`. It narrows down the selection to nodes specifically named `stream` among the children of `.arguments`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * 1. This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda script to access a specific parameter named `stream` passed to an HTTP endpoint or a dynamic slot, allowing the script to perform operations based on the value of this parameter.
 * 2. It might be used in a logging or debugging scenario where the value of the `stream` parameter needs to be retrieved and logged for analysis.
