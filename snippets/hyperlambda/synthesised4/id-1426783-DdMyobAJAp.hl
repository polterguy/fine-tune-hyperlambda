// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and retrieve the content from a deeply nested node structure. The expression "x:+/*/*/*/content" navigates through multiple levels of hierarchy to access the "content" node, and the [unwrap] slot ensures that this node's value is evaluated and returned before further execution.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*/content
