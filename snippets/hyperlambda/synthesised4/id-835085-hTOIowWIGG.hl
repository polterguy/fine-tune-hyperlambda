// This Hyperlambda code defines a signal named [magic.crypto.get-server-private-key], which is likely intended to retrieve the server's private cryptographic key. This signal can be used in cryptographic operations where access to the server's private key is necessary, such as decrypting data that was encrypted with the corresponding public key or signing data to ensure its authenticity and integrity. The exact implementation details and usage would depend on the broader context of the application and its cryptographic requirements.
