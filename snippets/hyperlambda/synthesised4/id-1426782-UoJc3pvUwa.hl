/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks multiple conditions on a data node. It verifies if the "stock_status" is "instock", ensures the "description" is not null, and confirms the "description" is not an empty string. If all conditions are met, it evaluates to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Combines multiple conditions, all of which must be true.
 * 2. [eq] - Checks if the "stock_status" is equal to "instock".
 * 3. [not-null] - Ensures the "description" node is not null.
 * 4. [neq] - Confirms the "description" node is not an empty string.
