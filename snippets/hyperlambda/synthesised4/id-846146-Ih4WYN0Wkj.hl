// This Hyperlambda code updates a record in the "ml_training_snippets" table, setting the "prompt" field to "Common". It uses the [data.update] slot to perform the update operation, specifying the table and values to update. The [where] clause ensures that only the record with an "id" equal to the first "id" value retrieved from a previous [data.read] operation is updated. The use of [and] within [where] allows for multiple conditions, although only one is used here.
