// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.create] slot to insert a new record into the "roles" table in a database. It specifies the table name as "roles" and uses the [values] slot to define the columns and their corresponding values, which are dynamically retrieved from the [.arguments] node using lambda expressions for the "name" and "description" fields. This approach helps prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries.
data.create
   table:roles
   values
      name:x:@.arguments/*/role
      description:x:@.arguments/*/description
