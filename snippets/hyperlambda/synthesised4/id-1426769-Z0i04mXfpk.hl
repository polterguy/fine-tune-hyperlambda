// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.dp/#/*/column_default] is equal to the value of the node represented by [.]. The [eq] slot is used to perform this equality comparison, where [get-value] retrieves the value of the specified node. If the values are the same, the [eq] slot will evaluate to true.
