// This Hyperlambda code checks if a "description" node exists within the current node and if its length is more than 300 characters. If both conditions are true, it truncates the "description" to the first 300 characters. The [if] slot evaluates the conditions using [and], [exists], and [mt] slots, while the [.lambda] block uses [set-value] and [strings.substring] to modify the "description".
