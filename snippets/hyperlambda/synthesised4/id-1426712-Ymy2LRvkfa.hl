/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code checks if the result of an HTTP POST request is greater than or equal to 200. The [mte] slot is used to perform a "more than or equal" comparison, where the expression [x:@http.post] retrieves the result of the HTTP POST request, and the child node [.:int:200] specifies the integer value 200 for comparison. This can be useful for verifying if the HTTP POST request was successful, as HTTP status codes 200 and above generally indicate success. 
 * // 1. [mte] - Performs a "more than or equal" comparison.
 * // 2. [x:@http.post] - Retrieves the result of the HTTP POST request.
 * // 3. [.:int:200] - Specifies the integer value 200 for comparison.
