// This Hyperlambda code replaces occurrences of the string "[[submit_button]]" within the node referenced by [@.result] with the string "true". It uses the [set-value] slot to update the value of [@.result] by applying the [strings.replace] slot, which performs the string replacement operation. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first specifies the substring to be replaced, and the second specifies the replacement string.
set-value:x:@.result
   strings.replace:x:@.result
      .:[[submit_button]]
      .:true
