/*
 * This Hyperlambda code calculates the time difference between the current date and time and a specified beginning time, storing the result in a node named [.time]. It uses the [math.subtract] slot to perform the subtraction operation. 
 * 
 * 1. **[set-value]** - Sets the value of the [.time] node.
 * 2. **[math.subtract]** - Subtracts the value of the [get-value:x:@.begin] node from the current date and time.
 * 3. **[date.now]** - Retrieves the current date and time.
 * 4. **[get-value]** - Retrieves the value of the [.begin] node.
