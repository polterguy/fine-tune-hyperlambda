/*
 * 1. `@.arg` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arg" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is useful for accessing a specific node that might be a parent or ancestor in the current context.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arg" node. It is used to access any direct children of the "arg" node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `schema` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "schema" among the children of the "arg" node. It is useful for narrowing down the search to nodes specifically named "schema."
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "schema" node. It is used to access any direct children of the "schema" node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 5. `type` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "type" among the children of the "schema" node. It is useful for accessing specific nodes that define a type within a schema.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * 
 * - Retrieving the data type information from a schema definition within a configuration or data structure.
 * - Accessing type metadata for validation or processing purposes in a system that uses schemas to define data structures.
