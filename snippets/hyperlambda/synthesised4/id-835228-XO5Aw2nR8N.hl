// This Hyperlambda code uses an [if] statement to check if the trimmed value of a node is equal to "[DONE]". If true, it executes a lambda object that sends a signal using [sockets.signal] to a session, indicating that a process is finished with a boolean value of true. The [eq] slot is used for the equality check, and [sockets.signal] transmits the message.
