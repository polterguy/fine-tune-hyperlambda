/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by finding the first node with the name "arguments" from the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it looks for a node with the specified name.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "arguments" node. It effectively expands the search to include every direct child node under "arguments".
 * 
 * 3. `epochs` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "epochs" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It ensures that only nodes with the name "epochs" are selected.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a machine learning context where the number of training epochs is specified as an argument to a function or a slot. It allows the retrieval of the "epochs" value to determine how many times the training process should iterate over the dataset.
 * - Another use case could be in a configuration setting where multiple parameters are passed, and the expression is used to extract the specific "epochs" parameter for further processing or validation.
