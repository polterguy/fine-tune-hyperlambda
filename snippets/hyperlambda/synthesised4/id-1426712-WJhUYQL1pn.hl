/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the string contained in the [result] node does not include the substring "___". If this condition is true, it evaluates the lambda object within the [if] statement. The lambda object first unwraps the content of a node located two levels below the current node. Then, it sends a signal to a specified session using the [sockets.signal] slot, transmitting a message argument that is extracted from a JSON structure at a specific path. This code is useful for conditionally sending a message to a session if a particular substring is absent in the result node. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if a condition is true to execute its lambda object.
 * 2. [not] - Negates the result of its child condition.
 * 3. [strings.contains] - Checks if the [result] node contains the substring "___".
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the [if] condition is true.
 * 5. [unwrap] - Evaluates and unwraps the content of a node two levels below the current node.
 * 6. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to a specified session.
 * 7. [args] - Contains the arguments to transmit with the signal.
 * 8. [message] - Extracts the message content from a JSON structure to send with the signal.
