// The [case] slot is used within a [switch] block to define specific conditions or values that, when matched, will execute the associated lambda object. Each [case] node must have a value, which can be a constant or an expression, and the [switch] node evaluates these to determine which [case] to execute. If no [case] matches, an optional [default] node can be executed.
