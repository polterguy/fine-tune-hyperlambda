// This code snippet uses the [add] slot to append the results of two [get-nodes] operations to a node named [data.read]. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves nodes specified by its expression, which in this case are [order] and [direction] nodes within the [.arguments] node. The [add] slot then adds these retrieved nodes to the [data.read] node, effectively aggregating the specified nodes under [data.read].
