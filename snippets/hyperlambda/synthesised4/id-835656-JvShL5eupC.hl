// This Hyperlambda code sets the HTTP response header "Cache-Control" to "public, max-age=300". This instructs the client to cache the response for 300 seconds, allowing for efficient resource management and reducing server load by enabling caching of the response. The [response.headers.set] slot is used to modify the response headers, ensuring that the specified caching policy is applied to the HTTP response.
