/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement to evaluate a variable and execute a corresponding [case] block based on the variable's value. The [switch] node evaluates the value of [.val], and if it matches the value of a [case] node, it executes the associated block of code. If no [case] matches, the [default] block is executed. The result is stored in [.result].
 * 
 * 1. [.val] - Holds the value to be evaluated by the [switch] statement.
 * 2. [.result] - Stores the result of the executed [case] or [default] block.
 * 3. [switch] - Evaluates the value of [.val] and determines which [case] or [default] block to execute.
 * 4. [case:bar] - A case block that executes if [.val] equals "bar", setting [.result] to "Oops".
 * 5. [case:foo] - A case block that executes if [.val] equals "foo", setting [.result] to "Success!".
 * 6. [case:bit] - A case block that executes if [.val] equals "bit", but its action is not defined in the provided code.
 * 7. [default] - Executes if no [case] matches, setting [.result] to "Success!".
