// This Hyperlambda code uses the [not-null] slot to evaluate whether the node specified by the expression [@json2lambda/*/choices/0/*/finish_reason] exists and has a value. If the node is present and contains a value, the [not-null] slot will return true, indicating that the specified path is not null. This is useful for checking the presence and value of specific nodes within a JSON-to-lambda converted object.
