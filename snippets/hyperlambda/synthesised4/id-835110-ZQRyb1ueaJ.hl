// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of [.db-type] is "mssql" using the [eq] slot. If true, it executes the [.lambda] block, which changes the name of the [data.execute] node to [mssql.execute-batch] using the [set-name] slot. This is a conditional operation to modify node names based on database type.
