/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named "semantics" exists among the children of the [.arguments] node. If it does not exist, the [or] condition evaluates to true due to the [not] and [exists] combination. If it exists, the condition evaluates to the value of the "semantics" node. The [or] slot ensures that the condition evaluates to true if either the "semantics" node does not exist or if it exists and has a truthy value. 
 * 
 * 1. [or] - Logical OR operation that evaluates to true if any of its children evaluate to true.
 * 2. [not] - Negates the boolean value of its child, making true become false and vice versa.
 * 3. [exists:x:@.arguments/*/semantics] - Checks if a node named "semantics" exists among the children of the [.arguments] node.
 * 4. [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/semantics] - Retrieves the value of the "semantics" node if it exists.
