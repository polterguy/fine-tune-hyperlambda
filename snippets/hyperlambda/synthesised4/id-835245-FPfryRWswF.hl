// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate a complex expression, which navigates through multiple nodes in a hierarchy to access specific child nodes. This allows for dynamic evaluation and manipulation of node values before they are reached in execution. The expression traverses up and down the node structure, targeting nodes such as [.sse] and [.extra].
