// The code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node referenced by its expression to the content of a file. It achieves this by invoking [io.file.load] with a lambda expression pointing to the [.filename] node, effectively loading the file's content and setting it as the new value for the target node.
set-value:x:-
   io.file.load:x:@.filename
