// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [type] slot to determine and return the type of the node directly preceding it. In this case, it retrieves the type of the node named [.foo] which has been explicitly declared as an integer with the value 57. The [type] slot is used to dynamically ascertain the data type of a node's value within a Hyperlambda structure.
