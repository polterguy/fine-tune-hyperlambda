/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by searching for the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an HTTP endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [session]. It is used to specifically target the [session] node among the arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access a session-related argument passed to a function or an HTTP endpoint. It might be useful in scenarios where session information needs to be retrieved for authentication or maintaining user state across requests.
