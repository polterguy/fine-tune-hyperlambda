// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached, effectively "forward evaluating" expressions. Here, it unwraps the expression `x:+/*/*`, which points to a node structure, allowing the value to be evaluated and used before the execution reaches the node.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
