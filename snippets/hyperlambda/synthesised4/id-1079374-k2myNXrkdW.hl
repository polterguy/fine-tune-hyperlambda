/*
 * 1. `@.sql` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "sql" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches upwards in the node structure, starting from the current node, and returns the first match it encounters. 
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used to dynamically reference a SQL query or command that is defined earlier in the Hyperlambda script. By using this iterator, you can easily access and potentially modify or execute the SQL command from different parts of the script without having to duplicate the SQL node.
