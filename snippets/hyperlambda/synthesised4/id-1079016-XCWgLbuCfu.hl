/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "new-prompt" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a match. This iterator is useful when you need to access a specific node that is located above the current node in the structure, such as when you want to retrieve configuration or context information that is defined at a higher level in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases include:
 * - Accessing configuration settings defined at the top of a script or file.
 * - Retrieving a common ancestor node to apply changes or gather information that affects multiple sibling nodes.
