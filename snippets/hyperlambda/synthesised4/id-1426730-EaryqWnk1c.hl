/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot in Hyperlambda to retrieve the type of a node's value. It first defines a node [.foo] with an integer value of 57 and then uses the [type] slot to get the type of the node's value. The result of the [type] invocation will be "int", indicating the type of the [.foo] node's value. 
 * 
 * 1. [.foo:int:57] - Declares a node named [.foo] with an integer type and a value of 57.
 * 2. [type:x:-] - Retrieves the type of the node's value, which in this case will be "int".
