/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is used to convert the value of a node named [threshold] within the [.arguments] node to a double type. It then sets this converted value back to the [threshold] node. This ensures that the [threshold] node's value is always stored as a double, regardless of its original type. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node specified by the expression.
 * 2. [convert] - Converts the value of the specified node to a different type.
 * 3. [type] - Specifies the target type for the conversion, in this case, double.
