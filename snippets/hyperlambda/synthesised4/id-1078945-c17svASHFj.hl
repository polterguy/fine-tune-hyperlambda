/*
 * 1. `@.outgoing`: This iterator searches for the first node named "outgoing" within the current node's context. It starts from the current node and looks at its siblings and their descendants. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate data specifically associated with an "outgoing" node within a larger data structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration settings or data related to outgoing network connections or messages.
 * - Retrieving information from a node structure where "outgoing" represents a specific category or type of data.
