// This Hyperlambda code performs a mathematical operation where it first adds two integers (5 and 3) using the [math.add] slot, resulting in 8. Then, it subtracts 2 from 30 and the result of the addition (8) using the [math.subtract] slot, resulting in 20. The slots demonstrate nested mathematical operations, combining addition and subtraction.
