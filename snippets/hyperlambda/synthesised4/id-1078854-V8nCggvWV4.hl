/*
 * 1. `@.models` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "models" in the current context. It is typically used to locate a specific section within a larger data structure, often at the root level or within a known parent node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "models" node. It is useful for iterating over all direct descendants of a node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of each child node of "models". This effectively allows for accessing nodes that are two levels deep within the "models" node.
 * 
 * 4. `type` - This iterator filters the results to only include nodes with the name "type" from the previous result set. It is used to focus on specific data points within a larger set of nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `"{@for-each/@.dp/#/*/type}"` - This is an extrapolated expression that evaluates to the value of the "type" node within the context of a "for-each" loop. The `@for-each/@.dp/#/*/type` part retrieves the "type" node from the current item being processed in the loop, where `@for-each` refers to the loop itself, `@.dp` accesses the current node being iterated, `#` dereferences its value, and `*` retrieves its children nodes. This expression is used to dynamically compare or assign values based on the current iteration context.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in scenarios where you need to compare or validate types across a collection of models, ensuring consistency or identifying mismatches.
 * - It can also be used to dynamically generate a list of types for reporting or further processing within a data transformation pipeline.
