// The code demonstrates the use of the [switch] slot in Hyperlambda to perform conditional branching based on the value of a node. It evaluates different cases and executes the corresponding block of code for the matching case. The [default] slot provides a fallback block of code if none of the cases match. This structure is useful for executing specific logic based on varying conditions without using multiple [if] statements.
