// This code checks if a "Content-Type" header does not exist in an HTTP GET request or if it exists but does not start with "text/html". It uses [or] to evaluate two conditions: [not-exists] checks for the absence of the "Content-Type" header, and [not] combined with [strings.starts-with] verifies if the existing "Content-Type" does not begin with "text/html".
