// Creates a memory-based ZIP stream that can be returned over an HTTP response. This slot evaluates both its root arguments and content nodes, allowing for dynamic content creation within the ZIP stream. It is useful for returning zipped content over HTTP without creating a physical ZIP file, as the stream is memory-based and does not require explicit closure.
