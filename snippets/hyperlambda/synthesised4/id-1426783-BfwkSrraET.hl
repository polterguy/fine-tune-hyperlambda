// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing forward evaluation of expressions. In this case, the expression "x:+/*/*" is unwrapped, which means it will evaluate the expression and replace the node's value with the result of the evaluation before the node is reached by the Hyperlambda instruction pointer.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
