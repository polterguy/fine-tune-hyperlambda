// 1. `@.parent`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "parent" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It is useful when you need to access a specific ancestor node by name, especially when the node structure is complex and you need to ensure you're referencing the correct node in relation to the current context.
