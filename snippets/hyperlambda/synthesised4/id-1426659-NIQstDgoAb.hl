// This Hyperlambda code evaluates a logical condition using [and] and [or] slots. It checks if either the [semantics] node does not exist or its value is true, and simultaneously verifies the existence of a [main] node within the [body] of an HTML structure. The condition evaluates to true only if both parts are satisfied. The slots used are: [and], [or], [not], [exists], and [get-value].
