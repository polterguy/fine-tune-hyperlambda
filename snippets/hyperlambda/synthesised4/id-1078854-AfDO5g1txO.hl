/*
 * 1. `@auth` - This iterator looks for the first node with the name "auth" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards and sideways through siblings until it finds a match.
 * 
 * 2. `ticket` - Once the "auth" node is found, this iterator looks for a child node named "ticket" under the "auth" node. It filters the children of the "auth" node to find "ticket".
 * 
 * 3. `get` - After locating the "ticket" node, this iterator looks for a child node named "get" under the "ticket" node. It filters the children of the "ticket" node to find "get".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve a specific node structure related to authentication tickets, possibly to verify or manipulate authentication data.
 * - It might be used in a context where you need to access or validate a user's authentication ticket details, such as in an authentication or authorization process.
