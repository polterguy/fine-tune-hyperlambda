 * 1. [strings.starts-with] - Evaluates whether the string value of the node specified by the expression starts with the given sequence.
 * 2. [x:@.value] - Expression pointing to the node whose value is being checked.
 * 3. [.:https://] - The sequence of characters that the string is checked against to see if it starts with this sequence.
