// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a join operation between two tables, `ml_training_snippets` and `ml_types`, based on a condition where the `type` column in both tables must be equal. The [join] slot specifies the table to join with, and the [on] slot contains the condition for the join, using the [and] and [eq] slots to ensure the `type` columns match.
