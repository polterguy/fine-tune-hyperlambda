/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes to a specified location in a Hyperlambda graph. It uses the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot. The [get-nodes] slot fetches nodes from the result of a [data.select] operation, and these nodes are then added to the [recent-orders] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified location in the graph.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the result of a [data.select] operation.
