/*
 * 1. `@.invoke` - This iterator searches for the first node named "invoke" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is useful for finding a specific node within the current context, especially when you are unsure of its exact location but know its name.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "invoke" node. It is useful when you want to perform operations or checks on all children of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `.result` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "result" among the children of the "invoke" node. It is useful for extracting specific information or values from a set of nodes, especially when you are interested in a particular type of data or result.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to retrieve the result of a specific invocation or operation within a larger Hyperlambda graph. For example, if you have multiple invocations and you want to check or log the result of a particular one, this expression would help you pinpoint the "result" node associated with the "invoke" node.
