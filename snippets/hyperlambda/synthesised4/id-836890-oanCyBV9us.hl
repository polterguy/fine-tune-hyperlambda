// The code uses the [return-nodes] slot to return all nodes from the result of the expression [@data.read/*/*]. This expression retrieves all nodes that are two levels deep under the [data.read] node, and [return-nodes] will return these nodes as the result of a dynamic slot or other context that supports returning nodes.
