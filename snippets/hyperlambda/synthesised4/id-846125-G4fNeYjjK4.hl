// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [system_message] exists within [.arguments] and has a non-null value. It then verifies that the value of [system_message] is not an empty string. The [and] slot ensures both conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. The [not-null] slot checks for non-null values, while the [neq] slot confirms the value is not an empty string.
