// This Hyperlambda code checks if three conditions are true using the [and] slot. It verifies if the value of [prompt] is equal to the value of [completion], if the value of [completion] is equal to the value of [type], and if the value of [type] is equal to the value of the [type] node inside [.arguments]. If all conditions are true, the [and] slot evaluates to true.
