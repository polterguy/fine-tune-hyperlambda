// This Hyperlambda code snippet retrieves and returns the type of a specified node. The [type] slot is used to determine the Hyperlambda type of the node it points to, which in this case is the previous node due to the "-" expression. This can be useful for dynamically checking or validating the type of a node within a Hyperlambda script.
