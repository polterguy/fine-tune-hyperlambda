// The code snippet invokes a dynamic slot named [magic.ai.html.extract] using the [signal] slot. It passes several arguments to this slot, including [url], [images], [code], [lists], [main], and [html]. The [url] argument is derived from the [query] node under [.arguments], while [html] is obtained from the result of a previous [signal] invocation. The boolean arguments [images], [code], [lists], and [main] are set to true, indicating that these elements should be included in the extraction process.
