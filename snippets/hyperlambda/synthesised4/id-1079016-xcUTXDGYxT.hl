/*
 * 1. `@.invoke`: This iterator searches for the first node named "invoke" within the current context. It starts from the current node and traverses upwards through the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to access a specific node that might be located at different levels in the hierarchy, ensuring that you always get the first occurrence of a node named "invoke". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to dynamically execute or manipulate the first "invoke" node found in a complex Hyperlambda structure.
 * - It can be used to conditionally execute a block of code if an "invoke" node is present in the current execution context.
