// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.update] slot to update records in a database table named "ml_requests". It specifies the table to update and includes a [values] node to define the columns and values to be updated. The [where] clause, combined with the [and] slot, is used to specify conditions that determine which records will be updated, ensuring only specific entries are modified.
