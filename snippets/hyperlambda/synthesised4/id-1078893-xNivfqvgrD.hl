/*
 * 1. `@.lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "lambda" in the current context. It's useful for accessing a specific node when you know its name and it appears first in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected "lambda" node. It's useful for iterating over or accessing all direct descendants of a node.
 * 
 * 3. `lambda2hyper` - This filters the result set to include only nodes named "lambda2hyper" among the children of "lambda". This is useful when you need to narrow down the node set to a specific name.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected "lambda2hyper" node. It's used to access all direct descendants of a node.
 * 
 * 5. `timeshifts` - This filters the result set to include only nodes named "timeshifts" among the children of "lambda2hyper". It helps in narrowing down the node set to a specific name.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected "timeshifts" node. It's used to access all direct descendants of a node.
 * 
 * 7. `access_denied` - This filters the result set to include only nodes named "access_denied" among the children of "timeshifts". It helps in narrowing down the node set to a specific name.
 * 
 * 8. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected "access_denied" node. It's used to access all direct descendants of a node.
 * 
 * 9. `items` - This filters the result set to include only nodes named "items" among the children of "access_denied". It is useful for accessing specific data or elements within a structured data set.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a security or access control context where you need to retrieve a list of items that have been denied access during certain time shifts. 
 * - It can also be used in a logging or auditing system to track denied access attempts over time.
