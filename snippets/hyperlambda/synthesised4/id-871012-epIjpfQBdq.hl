// This Hyperlambda code checks two conditions using the [and] slot: it verifies if a node exists at the specified path using [exists], and it compares the token count of a given context with a threshold using [lt] and [openai.tokenize]. The [and] slot ensures both conditions must be true for the overall expression to evaluate to true.
