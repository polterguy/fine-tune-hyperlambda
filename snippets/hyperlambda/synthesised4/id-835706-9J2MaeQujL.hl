// The code snippet uses the [set-name] slot to change the names of all nodes referenced by its expression to the value obtained from [get-value]. The [set-name] expression targets all nodes that are grandchildren of the current node's elder sibling, while [get-value] retrieves the value of the [group_column] node from the [.arguments] node.
