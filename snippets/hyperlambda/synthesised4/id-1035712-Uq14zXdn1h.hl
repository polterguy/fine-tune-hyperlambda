/*
 * 1. `@.src` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "src" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards, looking for a node named "src". This is useful when you need to reference a specific node by name that is not a direct child of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "src" node. It allows you to access all the nodes directly under the "src" node, regardless of their names. This is useful when you want to perform operations on all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `foo` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "foo" from the children retrieved by the previous `*` iterator. This is useful when you need to perform operations on or retrieve data from nodes with a specific name among the children of a parent node.
