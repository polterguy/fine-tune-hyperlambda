/*
 * 1. `@.max-size`: This iterator searches for the first node named `max-size` that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to retrieve a configuration or setting value, such as a maximum size limit, that might be defined at a higher level in the node structure. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving a global configuration value that dictates the maximum size allowed for a certain operation or data structure.
 * - Accessing a limit or threshold value that is defined at a higher level in a hierarchy, ensuring consistent application of constraints across different parts of a system.
