// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [yield] slot to return values from a dynamic slot or a file execution. It retrieves the [ticket] node from the result of an [execute] invocation and the [extra] node from the current context, returning both as part of the execution's output. This allows the caller to access these specific nodes' values after the execution is complete.
yield
   ticket:x:@execute/*/ticket
   extra:x:@.extra/*
