/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds nodes to a specified location within a node graph. It uses the [add] slot to insert nodes at the path specified by the expression `./*/data.read/*/where/*/and`. The nodes being added are retrieved using the [get-nodes] slot, which points to all children of the [.arguments] node. This operation effectively appends the arguments to a specific part of the node graph, potentially for further processing or evaluation.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts nodes at the specified location within the node graph.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves all nodes under the [.arguments] node to be added.
