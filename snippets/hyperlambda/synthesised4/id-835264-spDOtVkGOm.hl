// The code checks if a specific URL does not exist in a collection of URLs. If the URL is not found, it unwraps and evaluates some expressions, then adds the URL to the collection. The [if] slot is used to conditionally execute the [unwrap] and [add] slots based on the result of the [not-exists] condition.
