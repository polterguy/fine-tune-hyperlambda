/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.fixed] node to the count of child nodes under the [.session] node. It uses [get-count] to determine how many children [.session] has and [set-value] to assign this count to [.fixed].
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 2. [get-count] - Returns the number of child nodes under the [.session] node.
