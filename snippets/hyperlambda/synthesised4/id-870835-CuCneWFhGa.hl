// This Hyperlambda code snippet constructs a file path for a public key by concatenating a directory path, a fingerprint, and a file extension. The [set-value] slot assigns the resulting string to the [.public-key-filename] node, using [strings.concat] to join the directory path "/etc/system/crypto/keys/public-", the fingerprint value retrieved by [get-value], and the file extension ".key".
set-value:x:@.public-key-filename
