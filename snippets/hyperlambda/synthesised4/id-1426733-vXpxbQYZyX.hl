// This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if the status code of an HTTP POST request, represented by [http.post], is less than 300. If the condition is true, it implies that the request was successful, as HTTP status codes below 300 indicate successful responses. The [lt] slot is used to perform this comparison, where the expression [x:@http.post] retrieves the status code, and the static value 300 is used as the threshold for comparison.
lt:x:@http.post
