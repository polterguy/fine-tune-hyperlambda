// The code snippet demonstrates how to save a file using a stream in Hyperlambda. It uses the [io.stream.save-file] slot to save the content of a stream to a file path specified by the [@.filepath] expression. The content to be saved is retrieved from a stream node within the [@.arguments/*/file/*/stream] path. This approach is useful for persisting data received as a stream, such as from an HTTP request.
io.stream.save-file:x:@.filepath
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/file/*/stream
