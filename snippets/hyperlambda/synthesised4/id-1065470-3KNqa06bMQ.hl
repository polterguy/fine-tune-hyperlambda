// 1. `@.no`: This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "no" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards through the ancestors and siblings until it finds a match. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node that is located earlier in the structure, such as when you want to retrieve a value or perform an operation based on a previously defined node.
