/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [case] slot with a decimal value. The [case] slot is typically used within a [switch] construct to execute specific code blocks based on matching conditions. In this example, a decimal value is used as the condition for the [case] slot, allowing for precise matching in scenarios where decimal values are involved. This can be particularly useful in financial calculations or any domain where decimal precision is crucial.
 * 
 * 1. [case] - This slot is used to define a condition within a [switch] construct, allowing for specific code execution based on matching a decimal value.
