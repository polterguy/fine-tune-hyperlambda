/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the node structure until it finds a node named "session".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access session-related data in a Hyperlambda application, such as user session information, authentication tokens, or session-specific settings.
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you need to verify or manipulate session data as part of a larger workflow or process within a Hyperlambda script.
