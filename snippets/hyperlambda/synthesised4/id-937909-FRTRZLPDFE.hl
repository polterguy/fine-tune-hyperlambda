// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [insert-after] slot to insert a new node after a specified node in a Hyperlambda structure. It targets the node [log1] within the [logs] node set and inserts a new node [log2] with the value "Next log entry" immediately after it. This allows for dynamic modification of the node structure by adding new nodes in specific positions.
