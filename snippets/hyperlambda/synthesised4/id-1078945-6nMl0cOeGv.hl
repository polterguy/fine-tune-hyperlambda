/*
 * 1. `@.channel`: This iterator searches for the first node named `channel` that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, checking each node's name until it finds a match. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located at various levels above the current node in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or context information stored in a `channel` node that is shared across different parts of a Hyperlambda script.
 * - Retrieving a node that acts as a communication channel or data bus in a complex hierarchical structure, allowing different parts of the script to read from or write to this shared node.
