// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a node set. It retrieves nodes using [get-nodes] from the [.arguments] node, specifically the [limit] and [offset] nodes, and appends them to the node set referenced by [data.read]. The [add] slot is used to modify the structure by adding new nodes, while [get-nodes] is used to select specific nodes based on an expression.
add:x:./*/data.read
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/limit
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/offset
