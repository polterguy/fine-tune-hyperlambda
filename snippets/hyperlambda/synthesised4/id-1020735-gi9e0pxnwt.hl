// 1. `@.arg`: This iterator searches for the first node named `arg` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors and siblings. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name within a complex hierarchical structure.
