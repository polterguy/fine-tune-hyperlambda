// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to determine the Hyperlambda type of a node's value. It assigns an integer value to [.foo] and then uses [type] with an expression pointing to the previous node to retrieve its type. The result of the [type] invocation will be the type name of the value in [.foo].
