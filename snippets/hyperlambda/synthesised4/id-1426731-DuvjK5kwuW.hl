/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to dynamically add nodes to a destination node by retrieving nodes from another location. Specifically, it uses the [add] slot to append nodes to the [.urls] node. The nodes to be added are obtained using the [get-nodes] slot, which retrieves all child nodes of the [urls] node located within the [signal] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds nodes to the specified destination node.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the specified expression, in this case, all child nodes of the [urls] node within [signal].
