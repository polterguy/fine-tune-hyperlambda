// This Hyperlambda code checks if the node referenced by the expression [.result] has a non-null value. If the node exists and has a value, the [not-null] slot will evaluate to true. This is useful for ensuring that a particular node in a Hyperlambda graph has been assigned a value before proceeding with further logic.
