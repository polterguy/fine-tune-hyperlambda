/*
 * 1. `@.request-raw`: This iterator looks for the first node named "request-raw" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you need to access raw request data in a Hyperlambda script, such as when processing HTTP requests or handling input data that hasn't been parsed or processed yet. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include accessing raw HTTP request data for logging, debugging, or custom parsing operations in a web application.
