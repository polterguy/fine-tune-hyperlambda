// This Hyperlambda code snippet updates the value of nodes under [.result] by incrementing their current value by 1. It first retrieves the node names under [.result] using [get-name], then uses [set-value] to apply [math.add] to each node's value, effectively increasing it by 1. The use of expressions allows dynamic selection and modification of nodes based on their names.
