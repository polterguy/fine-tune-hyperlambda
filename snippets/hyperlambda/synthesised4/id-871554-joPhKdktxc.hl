// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses [set-value] to change the value of the node referenced by its expression to the result of [get-value], which retrieves the value of the first child node of [hyper2lambda]. The [set-value] slot is used to update node values, while [get-value] fetches the value of a specified node.
set-value:x:-
   get-value:x:@hyper2lambda/0
