/*
 * - `@openai` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "openai" in the current context. It is useful when you need to access a specific node by name, ensuring that you are working with the correct node in a potentially large and complex node structure.
 * - `tokenize` - This part of the expression is not an iterator but rather a continuation of the node name from the previous iterator. It specifies that you are looking for a node named "tokenize" that is a child of the "openai" node. This is useful when you want to perform operations or retrieve data specifically from the "tokenize" node under the "openai" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * 1. Accessing a specific configuration or data node related to tokenization under an "openai" node in a larger Hyperlambda structure.
 * 2. Retrieving or manipulating data specifically related to tokenization processes defined under an "openai" node.
