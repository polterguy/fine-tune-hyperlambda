// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses an [else-if] conditional statement to compare the lengths of two strings. If the length of the string referenced by [.lhs] is greater than the length of the string referenced by [.rhs], it sets the value of [.result] to 1. The [strings.length] slot is used to determine the length of each string.
