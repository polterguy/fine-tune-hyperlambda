/*
 * 1. `@try` - This iterator looks for the first node named "try" in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further navigation within a node structure, specifically targeting a node named "try".
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "try" node. It is used to access any direct descendants of the "try" node, allowing further navigation through its structure.
 * 
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the children nodes of the "try" node to find a node named "signal". It is used to narrow down the search to nodes specifically named "signal" under the "try" node.
 * 
 * 4. `[0,1]` - This iterator retrieves a subset of nodes, specifically the first node in the result set. It is used to select the first occurrence of a "signal" node, assuming there might be multiple.
 * 
 * 5. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the selected "signal" node. It is used to access any direct descendants of the "signal" node, allowing further navigation through its structure.
 * 
 * 6. `id` - This iterator filters the children nodes of the "signal" node to find a node named "id". It is used to locate a specific node named "id" under the "signal" node, typically to retrieve or manipulate its value.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include error handling or logging mechanisms where you need to capture and process specific signals or identifiers within a "try" block, possibly to handle exceptions or signals in a structured way.
