/*
 * 1. `@.name`: This iterator searches for the first node named "name" within the current context or hierarchy. It will return the first occurrence of a node with this name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors if necessary.
 * 
 * Use case: This expression can be used to retrieve a specific configuration or setting value identified by the node name "name" within a larger Hyperlambda structure. For instance, if you have a configuration node named "name" that holds a value you need to access, this expression will help you find it efficiently.
