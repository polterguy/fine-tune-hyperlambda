 * This Hyperlambda code adds a new node with the name [model_size] and an integer value of 128000 as a child to the node pointed to by the expression [@.model]. The [add] slot is used to append new nodes to an existing node collection, allowing for dynamic modification of the node structure. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends a new node to the node set specified by its expression.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the root node for the children being added.
 * 3. [model_size] - The name of the new node being added.
 * 4. [int:128000] - The type and value of the new node being added.
