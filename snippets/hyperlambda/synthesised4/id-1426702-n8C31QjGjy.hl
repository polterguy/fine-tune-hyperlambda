// This Hyperlambda code modifies the value of the [.file-data] node by extracting a substring from it. The substring starts at the second character (index 1) and extends to the length of the original string minus two characters. The [set-value] slot is used to change the [.file-data] node's value, and the [strings.substring] slot is employed to obtain the desired substring. The [math.subtract] slot calculates the length of the substring by subtracting 2 from the total length of the original string.
