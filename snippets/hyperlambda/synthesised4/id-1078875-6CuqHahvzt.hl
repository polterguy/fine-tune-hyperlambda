/*
 * 1. `@strings.split` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "strings.split". It searches through the current node's hierarchy, starting from the current node and moving upwards and sideways through siblings until it finds the first node named "strings.split". This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the "strings.split" node specifically, perhaps to modify its behavior or retrieve its value.
 * 
 * 2. `0` - This iterator retrieves the first child node of the result set from the previous iterator. In this context, it would return the first child of the "strings.split" node. This is useful when you need to access the first element or parameter of the "strings.split" operation, which might represent the string to be split or the delimiter used for splitting.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing the first parameter of a string splitting operation to verify or modify the delimiter used.
 * - Retrieving the first part of a split string operation for further processing or validation.
