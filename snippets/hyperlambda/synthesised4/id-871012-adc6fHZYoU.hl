// This Hyperlambda code checks the HTTP status code of a [http.post] request to ensure it is between 200 and 299. If not, it logs an error and throws an exception with details. The [not] and [and] slots are used to evaluate the condition, while [lambda2hyper] converts the response to a Hyperlambda string for logging. The [log.error] and [throw] slots capture and report the error details, including the message and status from the response.
