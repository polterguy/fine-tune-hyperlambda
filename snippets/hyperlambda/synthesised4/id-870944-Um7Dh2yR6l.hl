// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to append nodes to a destination node. The [add] slot takes an expression pointing to a destination node, and in this case, it uses the "+" iterator to reference the next sibling node. The [get-nodes] slot is used to retrieve all child nodes of the [.arguments] node, and these nodes are then added to the destination node specified by the [add] slot. This operation effectively copies all child nodes of [.arguments] to the next sibling node of the current node.
