// This Hyperlambda code reads data from a "users" table, selecting the "name" and "email" columns. It applies a "where" condition to filter records where the "id" column equals the value of the "user-id" argument from the input. The "and" slot is used to combine multiple conditions, though only one condition is specified here.
