// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database table named "campaigns" using the [data.read] slot. It specifies a column with an aggregate function, aliased as "result", and includes a [where] clause with an [and] condition, though the specific conditions are not detailed. The [limit] is set to 1, ensuring that only one record is returned from the query.
