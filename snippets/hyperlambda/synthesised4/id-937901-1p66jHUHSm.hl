// This Hyperlambda code checks the value of a node named [condition]. If the value evaluates to true, it sets the value of the [result] node to "Condition met". The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, where the condition is determined by the value retrieved using [get-value]. If the condition is true, the [.lambda] block is executed, which in this case updates the [result] node.
