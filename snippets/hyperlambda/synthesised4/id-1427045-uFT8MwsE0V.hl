/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL read operation on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "Customers" table. It includes an aggregate function, which is aliased as "result", and applies a "group by" clause on a specified column. The "where" clause is present but not detailed, indicating a placeholder for conditions to filter the results. This setup is useful for generating summarized data based on grouped records. 
 * 
 * 1. [database-type] - Specifies the type of database being used, in this case, SQLite.
 * 2. [table] - Indicates the table from which data is being read, here it's "Customers".
 * 3. [columns] - Lists the columns to be selected, including an aggregate function.
 * 4. [aggregate_functor] - Represents an aggregate function to be applied, aliased as "result".
 * 5. [where] - Placeholder for conditions to filter the query results.
 * 6. [and] - Logical operator for combining multiple conditions in the "where" clause.
 * 7. [group] - Specifies the column(s) to group the results by.
 * 8. [group_column] - The column used for grouping the data.
