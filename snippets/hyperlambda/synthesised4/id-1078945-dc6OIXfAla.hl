/*
 * 1. `@signal`: This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and their children, until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to find a specific node that might not be a direct child of the current node but is somewhere in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "signal" node, regardless of their names. This is helpful when you want to perform operations on all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `snippets`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "snippets" among the children of the "signal" node. It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes with a specific name, which is useful when you are interested in a particular type of node among many.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a "signal" node containing various child nodes, and you want to extract or manipulate only those child nodes specifically named "snippets". For example, in a logging or notification system, "signal" might represent an event, and "snippets" could be pieces of information or actions related to that event.
