/*
 * This expression is a lambda expression that is used to reference a node in the currently executed graph object. Let's break down the expression `@lambda2hyper`:
 * 
 * 1. `@` - This is the "name comparison iterator." It retrieves the first node "before" in its hierarchy that matches the given name. In this case, it looks for the first node with the name `lambda2hyper`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to find and manipulate a specific node named `lambda2hyper` within a larger Hyperlambda graph. For example, it could be used to retrieve the value of this node, modify it, or use it in a conditional statement.
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically access and process data associated with the `lambda2hyper` node, such as in a configuration or data processing task.
