/*
 * 1. `@.sql` - This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which means it will search for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `.` symbol indicates that it will begin the search from the current node's parent. This iterator is useful when you need to access a node named "sql" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a SQL query or command stored in a "sql" node for execution or further processing.
 * - Accessing configuration or connection details related to SQL operations that are stored in a "sql" node.
