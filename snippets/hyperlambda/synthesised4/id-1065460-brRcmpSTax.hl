// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "sql" from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, and the `.` symbol specifies that it starts from the current node's context. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the value of a specific node within the current scope, particularly when dealing with SQL queries or commands stored in a node named "sql".
