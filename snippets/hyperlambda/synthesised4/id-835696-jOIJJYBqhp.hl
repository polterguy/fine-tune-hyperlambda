/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code sets a custom HTTP response header for caching. By using the [response.headers.set] slot, it specifies the "Cache-Control" header with the value "public, max-age=300", indicating that the response can be cached by any cache and should be considered fresh for 300 seconds. This configuration helps in controlling the caching behavior of HTTP responses. 
 * 
 * 1. [response.headers.set] - Sets the HTTP response header.
 * 2. [Cache-Control:public, max-age=300] - Specifies the caching policy for the HTTP response.
