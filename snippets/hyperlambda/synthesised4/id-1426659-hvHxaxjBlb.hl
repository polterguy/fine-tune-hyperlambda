// The [unwrap] slot in this Hyperlambda code is used to evaluate the expressions of the nodes it references before they are reached in the execution flow. The expression "x:+/*/*" indicates that the [unwrap] slot will evaluate the children and grandchildren of the current node's elder sibling. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions in a lambda object, allowing the values to be determined before the lambda object is executed.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
