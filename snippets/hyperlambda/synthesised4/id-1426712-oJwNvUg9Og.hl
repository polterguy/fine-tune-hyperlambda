/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if a node named [data] exists within the [.arguments] node, ensures that it is not null, and verifies that its value is not equal to an empty string. If all these conditions are true, the [and] slot evaluates to true. The code uses three slots: [exists] to confirm the presence of the [data] node, [not-null] to ensure it has a value, and [neq] to check that the value is not an empty string. The [and] slot combines these checks, requiring all to be true for the overall condition to be true. 
 * 
 * 1. [exists] - Checks if the [data] node exists within [.arguments].
 * 2. [not-null] - Ensures the [data] node has a non-null value.
 * 3. [neq] - Verifies the [data] node's value is not equal to an empty string.
