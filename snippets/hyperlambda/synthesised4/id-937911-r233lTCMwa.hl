// This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.matches] slot to find matches in the [.email] node's value using a regular expression. The regex pattern is designed to match valid email addresses by checking for a sequence of characters that fit the typical structure of an email. If the [.email] node contains a valid email address, the matches will be returned.
strings.matches:x:@.email
