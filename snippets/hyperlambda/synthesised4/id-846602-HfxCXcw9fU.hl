// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Appointments" and "Patients", using the [join] slot. It specifies the join type as "left" and uses an alias "PatientID" for the "Patients" table. The join condition is defined using the [on] slot, where it matches the "PatientID" column from both tables. This setup is useful for retrieving all records from the "Appointments" table and the matching records from the "Patients" table, with nulls in the result set where there is no match.

   as:PatientID
   type:left
