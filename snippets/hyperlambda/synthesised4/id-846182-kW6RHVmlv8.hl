// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement. The [switch] slot evaluates a given value and executes the first [case] node with a matching value. In this example, the [case] node is used to handle a specific condition, allowing for conditional branching based on the evaluated value. The [switch] statement is a powerful tool for managing multiple conditional paths in Hyperlambda.
