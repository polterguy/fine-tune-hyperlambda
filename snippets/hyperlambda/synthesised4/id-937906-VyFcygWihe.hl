// This Hyperlambda code iterates over the nodes named "first" or "second" within the ".group" node using the [for-each] slot. For each iterated node, it changes its value to "selected" by using the [set-value] slot, with the [#] iterator ensuring the value is set by reference. The [for-each] slot passes each node into the [.dp] node by reference, allowing the [set-value] slot to modify the original node's value directly.
