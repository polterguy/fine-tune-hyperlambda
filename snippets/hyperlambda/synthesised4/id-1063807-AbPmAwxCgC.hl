// 1. `@strings.concat` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `strings.concat` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with this specific name. This is useful when you want to directly reference a node by its name to retrieve its value or perform operations on it. In this context, it could be used to find a node responsible for concatenating strings, possibly to retrieve the result of that concatenation or to further manipulate it.
