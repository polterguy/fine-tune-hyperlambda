/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [switch] slot to perform conditional branching based on the value of a node. It evaluates the value of the [.val] node and executes the corresponding [case] node that matches this value. If no [case] matches, the [default] node is executed. The result of the evaluation is stored in the [.result] node. The code showcases how to use [switch] for decision-making in Hyperlambda, similar to a switch/case block in traditional programming languages.
 * 
 * 1. [.val] - Sets the value to be evaluated in the switch statement.
 * 2. [.result] - Placeholder node to store the result of the switch evaluation.
 * 3. [switch] - Initiates the switch statement, evaluating the value of [.val].
 * 4. [case:bar] - First case to be evaluated; sets [.result] to "Oops" if matched.
 * 5. [case:foo] - Second case to be evaluated; sets [.result] to "Success!" if matched.
 * 6. [default] - Executed if no [case] matches; sets [.result] to "Success!".
