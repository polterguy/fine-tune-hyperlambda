/*
 * 1. `@.url`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "url" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches through the current node's ancestors and their siblings to find the specified node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to dynamically access a URL value that is defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure, allowing for flexible and reusable code.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where the URL is set as a configuration or input parameter at a higher level in the hierarchy, and you need to reference it in various parts of your Hyperlambda code.
