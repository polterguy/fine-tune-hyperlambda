/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] from the current context. The [.arguments] node is typically used to pass arguments to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda. It is a common practice to define this node at the beginning of a lambda or an HTTP endpoint to specify the parameters that the lambda or endpoint expects.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the [.arguments] node. This is useful when you want to access all the arguments passed to a function or slot, as it allows you to iterate over each argument node individually.
 * 
 * 3. `max_function_invocations` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name [max_function_invocations]. This is used to specifically target the argument or parameter that is named [max_function_invocations], which could be used to set or retrieve a limit on the number of times a function can be invoked within a certain context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you want to enforce a limit on the number of times a particular function can be invoked, perhaps to prevent infinite loops or excessive resource consumption.
 * - It might be used in a logging or monitoring system to track or restrict the usage of certain functions or operations, ensuring they do not exceed a predefined threshold.
