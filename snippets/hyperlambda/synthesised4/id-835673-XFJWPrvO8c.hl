// This Hyperlambda snippet sets an HTTP response header to control caching behavior. The [response.headers.set] slot is used to specify the "Cache-Control" header, setting it to "public, max-age=300", which instructs clients to cache the response for 300 seconds. This is useful for optimizing performance by reducing server load and improving response times for frequently accessed resources.
