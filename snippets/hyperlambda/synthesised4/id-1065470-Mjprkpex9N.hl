// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with a specific name, and the `.` before `sql` specifies that it should start the search from the current node's parent. This is useful when you want to reference a specific node by name within the current hierarchy, such as when you have a node named "sql" that contains SQL query information or configuration details that you need to access or manipulate.
