// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specified location. It retrieves nodes using the [get-nodes] slot from a specific path and adds them to the location determined by the [add] slot's expression. The [get-nodes] slot fetches nodes from the path specified in its expression, which in this case is within the result of an [http.get] operation.
