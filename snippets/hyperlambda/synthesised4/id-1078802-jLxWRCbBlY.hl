/*
 * 1. `@.foo`: This iterator searches for the first node named "foo" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its hierarchy. It will return the first node it encounters with the name "foo". This is useful when you need to locate a specific node in your structure that might be a parent or ancestor of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `-`: This iterator retrieves the younger sibling of the node found by the previous iterator. In this context, it will get the node immediately preceding the "foo" node. This is useful when you need to access a node that is structurally adjacent to a known node.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator. In this context, it will get all children of the younger sibling of the "foo" node. This is useful for iterating over or processing all child nodes of a specific node.
 * 
 * 4. `content`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "content". It will return all nodes named "content" that are children of the younger sibling of the "foo" node. This is useful when you need to extract specific data or nodes from a larger set of children.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to extract all "content" nodes that are children of the younger sibling of a "foo" node. This might be useful in scenarios where "foo" represents a section or category, and you need to process or display all content items related to the section immediately following "foo".
