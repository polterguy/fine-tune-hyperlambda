/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an HTTP endpoint in Hyperlambda. This is crucial for accessing input parameters or data that the function or endpoint needs to process.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access all the arguments provided, regardless of their names. This is useful when you want to iterate over or process multiple arguments without knowing their specific names.
 * 
 * 3. `referrer` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name `referrer`. It is used to specifically access the `referrer` argument, which might contain information about the source or origin of a request, such as a URL or an identifier.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in an HTTP endpoint to log or process the referrer information of a request, which can be useful for analytics or access control.
 * - It could also be used in a function that needs to customize its behavior based on the source of the request, such as applying different rules or settings depending on where the request originated.
