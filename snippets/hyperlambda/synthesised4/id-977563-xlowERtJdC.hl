// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each child node of the [fields] node within the [template] node using [for-each]. For each iterated node, it retrieves the node's name with [get-name] and sets the value of a corresponding node in the [form] node using [set-value], copying the value from the iterated node. This effectively maps field names and values from a template to a form structure.
