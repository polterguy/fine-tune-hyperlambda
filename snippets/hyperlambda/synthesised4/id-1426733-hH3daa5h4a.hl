// This Hyperlambda code snippet evaluates a logical condition using [and] and [or] slots. It checks if the [type] node under [.arguments] is equal to a specified value. If true, it further evaluates an [or] condition: either the [completion] node under [.dp] matches a specific value, or it is similar to a concatenated string value. The code is used to determine if certain conditions are met based on the values of [type] and [completion] nodes.
