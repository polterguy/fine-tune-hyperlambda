// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, [unwrap] is applied with the expression "x:+/*/*", which will forward evaluate the specified expression, allowing the node to be processed with its evaluated value before execution. This is useful for pre-evaluating expressions in dynamic scenarios.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
