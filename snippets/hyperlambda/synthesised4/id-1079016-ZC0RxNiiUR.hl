 * 1. `@.tmp`: This iterator searches for the first node named "tmp" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to directly access a specific node by its name in the current hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve configuration or temporary data stored under a node named "tmp" within the current execution context.
