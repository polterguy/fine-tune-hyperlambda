// This Hyperlambda code iterates over all descendant nodes of the [.settings] node using the [for-each] slot. For each node it iterates, it updates the node's value to "updated" by using the [set-value] slot. The [.dp] node represents the current node being iterated, and the `#` iterator ensures the value is updated by reference.
