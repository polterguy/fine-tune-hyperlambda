/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet constructs a connection string by concatenating a predefined string "[generic|" with the value of a "database" argument, and appending a closing bracket "]". The resulting connection string is then assigned to a node named ".connection". The code uses the [set-value] slot to set the value of the ".connection" node, and the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate the strings. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the ".connection" node to the result of the concatenation.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings to form the connection string.
 * 3. [.:[generic|] - A static string that is the beginning of the connection string.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the "database" argument from the ".arguments" node.
 * 5. [.:" ]" - A static string that is the end of the connection string.
