// This Hyperlambda code sends a SignalR event using the [sockets.signal] slot. It targets the session specified by the expression [x:@.session] and transmits an argument [args] containing a boolean value [finished:bool:true]. This indicates that something has been completed or finished, and the message is sent to all connections subscribed to the specified session. The [args] node is transformed into a JSON format before being sent.
