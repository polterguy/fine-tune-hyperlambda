// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using a left join between the "activities" and "clients" tables in a SQLite database. It specifies a column alias for the join, applies an aggregate function with an alias, and includes a group by clause. The [database-type] slot specifies the database, [table] and [join] slots define the tables and join conditions, [columns] specifies the columns to retrieve, [where] allows for filtering, and [group] defines the grouping criteria.
