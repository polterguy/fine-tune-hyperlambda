/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It is used to access the next node in the sequence at the same level of hierarchy in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you want to perform operations or evaluations on the node that follows the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access and possibly manipulate or evaluate all direct descendants of the node that the elder sibling iterator (`+`) has pointed to.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to navigate to the next sibling node and then retrieve all its children. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or evaluate all children of a specific sibling node in a sequence, such as iterating over a list of items that are grouped under sibling nodes.
