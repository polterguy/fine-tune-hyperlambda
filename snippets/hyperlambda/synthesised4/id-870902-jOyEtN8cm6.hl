/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specific location in a Hyperlambda graph. It targets the [where] node within the [data.delete] structure and appends nodes obtained from the [.arguments] node using [get-nodes]. This allows dynamic modification of the graph by incorporating argument nodes into a specified location. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified location in the graph.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node to be added.
