/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [switch] slot in Hyperlambda to handle different cases based on the value of the [user-agent] node. It checks the value of [user-agent] and executes corresponding logic for each [case] node, such as "Mozilla" or "Chrome", with a [default] case for unmatched values. The [switch] slot facilitates conditional branching based on specific criteria, allowing for tailored responses or actions depending on the user-agent string of an HTTP request.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Initiates a switch statement to evaluate the value of [user-agent].
 * 2. [case] - Specifies a condition to match against the [user-agent] value.
 * 3. [default] - Provides a default action if no [case] matches the [user-agent] value.
