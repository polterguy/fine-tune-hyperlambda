/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is a signal invocation for loading a sitemap using the [magic.ai.load-sitemap] slot. It takes several arguments: [max], [feedback-channel], [url], and [filter-on-url]. These arguments are used to configure the sitemap loading process, where [max] specifies the maximum number of items to load, [feedback-channel] is used for communication or logging purposes, [url] is the starting point for loading the sitemap, and [filter-on-url] is used to filter the URLs being loaded. The slot is part of the Magic AI module, which likely involves AI-related processing or analysis of the sitemap data. 
 * 
 * 1. [max] - Specifies the maximum number of items to load from the sitemap.
 * 2. [feedback-channel] - Used for communication or logging during the sitemap loading process.
 * 3. [url] - The starting URL for loading the sitemap.
 * 4. [filter-on-url] - Filters the URLs being loaded based on specific criteria.
