/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. The [else] slot executes its child nodes when none of the preceding conditional siblings ([if] or [else-if]) evaluate to true. In this example, the [else] block contains an [add] operation that adds nodes to a signal. It retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node, specifically from the [to] and [from] nodes, using the [get-nodes] slot, and adds them to the signal node specified by the expression [@.exe/*/signal].
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes its child nodes if none of its elder siblings evaluate to true.
 * 2. [add] - Adds nodes to the signal node specified in its expression.
 * 3. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node, specifically from the [to] node.
 * 4. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node, specifically from the [from] node.
