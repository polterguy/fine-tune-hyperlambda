/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node named "new-prompt" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, looking for a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that may be located at a higher level in the node structure, such as when you want to retrieve configuration settings or shared data that is stored in a common ancestor node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: If you have a configuration node named "new-prompt" that contains settings or parameters needed for processing, this expression allows you to quickly access it from any point in your Hyperlambda code.
