/*
 * This Hyperlambda code opens a database connection using a dynamic database name, checks if the database type is "mssql", and if so, renames the [data.execute] slot to [mssql.execute-batch] for batch execution. It then executes a script loaded from a file and logs a success message indicating the script was executed. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.connect] - Opens a database connection using a dynamic database name.
 * 2. [if] - Checks if the database type is "mssql".
 * 3. [eq] - Compares the database type to "mssql".
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the database type.
 * 5. [set-name] - Renames the [data.execute] slot to [mssql.execute-batch] for MSSQL batch execution.
 * 6. [data.execute] - Executes a script loaded from a file.
 * 7. [log.info] - Logs a success message indicating the script was executed.
 * 8. [script] - Contains the script that was executed, used in the log message.
