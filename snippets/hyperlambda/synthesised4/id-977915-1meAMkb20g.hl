// This Hyperlambda code sends an email using the [mail.smtp.send] slot. It constructs the email's recipient and name dynamically from the [.arguments] node using expressions. The email's subject is set to "Thanks for Signing Up", and the content is HTML, built dynamically using the [strings.builder] slot. The [message] node contains the email details, with [to], [subject], and [entity] nodes specifying the recipient, subject, and content type respectively.
