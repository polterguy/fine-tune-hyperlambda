// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, and the `.` before `sql` implies that it will look for this node starting from the current node's level and upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to retrieve a specific node by name that is not necessarily a direct child or descendant of the current node, but rather an ancestor or a sibling node.
