// The [auth.ticket.in-role] slot checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to the specified role(s), in this case "root". It returns true if the user is in the "root" role, otherwise false. This slot is used within an authorized context, such as an HTTP endpoint, to conditionally execute logic based on user roles without throwing exceptions.
