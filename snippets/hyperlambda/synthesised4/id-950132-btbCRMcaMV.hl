// This Hyperlambda code uses the [add] slot to append nodes from two source nodes, [origin1] and [origin2], into a destination node [destination_node]. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all child nodes of [origin1] and [origin2], and these nodes are then added as children to [destination_node]. This operation effectively merges the children of the two origin nodes into the destination node.
