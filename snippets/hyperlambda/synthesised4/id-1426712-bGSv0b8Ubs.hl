/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is used within an [else] block to concatenate a success message into the [.new-prompt] node. If the preceding conditions in an [if] or [else-if] block are not met, this [else] block executes, appending a message indicating the successful invocation of a workflow. It uses [strings.concat] to combine the current value of [.new-prompt] with a static message and the value of the [workflow] node from the [execute] node, followed by two newline characters. The result is stored back in [.new-prompt]. 
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes the following code if previous conditions are not met.
 * 2. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.new-prompt] node.
 * 3. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings together.
 * 4. [get-value:x:@.new-prompt] - Retrieves the current value of [.new-prompt].
 * 5. [get-value:x:@execute/*/workflow] - Retrieves the value of the [workflow] node from the [execute] node.
 * 6. [.:@"] - Represents a newline character.
