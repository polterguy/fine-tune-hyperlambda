// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database table named "CustomerDemographics". It specifies a distinct column selection using a functor, with the result being aliased to an empty name. The [where] clause is prepared for additional conditions, but currently, it only includes an [and] logical operator without any specific conditions. The setup is ready for further customization to filter the data based on specific criteria.
