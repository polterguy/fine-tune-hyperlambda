// This Hyperlambda code evaluates an [if] condition using an [or] logical operator. It checks if either the value of node [a] or [b] is true. If either condition is true, it executes the [.lambda] block, setting the value of the [decision] node to "Passed via OR". The [or] slot short-circuits, meaning it stops evaluating further once a true condition is found.
