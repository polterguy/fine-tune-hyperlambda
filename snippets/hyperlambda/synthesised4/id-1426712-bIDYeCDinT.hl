// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a new node to the [.session] node. The newly added node contains a child node with the name [role] and a static value of "user". It also includes another child node named [content], which dynamically retrieves its value from the [prompt] node within the [.arguments] node. This structure is useful for appending user roles and associated content to a session, potentially for session management or logging purposes.
