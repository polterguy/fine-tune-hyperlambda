The `@` symbol indicates that the search is for a node by its name, and the `.` specifies that the search starts from the current node's context. This expression is useful when you need to retrieve the value of a specific node named `.hook-url` within the current execution context. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a webhook URL stored in a specific node for making HTTP requests.
 * - Accessing configuration data related to webhooks in a Hyperlambda script.
