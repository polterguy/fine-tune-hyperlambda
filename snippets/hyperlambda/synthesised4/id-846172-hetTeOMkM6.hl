// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [case] slot with a CLOB (Character Large Object) data type. The [case] slot is typically used within a [switch] statement to handle different scenarios based on the value of a particular node. In this context, it likely involves handling large text data stored in a CLOB format. The [case] slot allows for branching logic based on the content or characteristics of the CLOB data, enabling specific operations or transformations to be applied depending on the case conditions.
