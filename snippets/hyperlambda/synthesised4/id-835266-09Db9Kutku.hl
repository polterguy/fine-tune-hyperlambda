/*
 * The code checks if the value of [already-exists] is greater than 0, and if true, it concatenates a message indicating the number of snippets already existing in the database. It then unwraps the message, sends it as a signal to a feedback channel, and pauses execution for 100 milliseconds. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if the condition is true to execute the subsequent lambda.
 * 2. [mt] - Compares the value of [already-exists] to 0.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 4. [strings.concat] - Concatenates the existing snippets count with a message.
 * 5. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of [already-exists].
 * 6. [unwrap] - Evaluates and processes the concatenated message.
 * 7. [sockets.signal] - Sends a message to the specified feedback channel.
 * 8. [args] - Contains the message and type for the signal.
 * 9. [message] - Holds the concatenated message to be sent.
 * 10. [type] - Specifies the type of message as "info".
 * 11. [sleep] - Pauses execution for 100 milliseconds.
