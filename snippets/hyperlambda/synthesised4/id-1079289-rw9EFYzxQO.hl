/*
 * 1. `@.dp`: This iterator searches for the first node named `.dp` in the current context. The `@` symbol signifies that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors if necessary. The `.dp` node is often used in Hyperlambda to refer to the "data pointer" or the current node being processed in a loop or iteration.
 * 
 * 2. `#`: This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the `.dp` node is a reference to another node, and it retrieves this referenced node. This is useful when you want to manipulate or access the actual node being pointed to by the `.dp` node, rather than just its value.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression is commonly used in a [for-each] loop to access and modify the nodes being iterated over. By de-referencing the `.dp` node, you can directly change the properties or values of the nodes in the loop.
