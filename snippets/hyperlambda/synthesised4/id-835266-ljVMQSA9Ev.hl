/*
 * The code checks if the number of nodes under [.snippets] is zero using [get-count] and [eq]. If true, it sends a warning message through a socket signal to a feedback channel, indicating no training snippets were found at the specified URL, and then pauses execution for 100 milliseconds using [sleep]. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Evaluates the condition and executes its lambda if true.
 * 2. [eq] - Compares the result of [get-count] to zero.
 * 3. [get-count] - Counts the number of nodes under [.snippets].
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the actions to execute if the condition is true.
 * 5. [sockets.signal] - Sends a message through a socket to a feedback channel.
 * 6. [args] - Holds the arguments for the socket signal.
 * 7. [message] - The warning message to send.
 * 8. [type] - Specifies the type of message as a warning.
 * 9. [sleep] - Pauses execution for 100 milliseconds.
