// The code demonstrates the use of the [fork] slot to execute a set of instructions in a separate thread. It first pauses execution for 1000 milliseconds using [sleep], and then logs a message "INSIDE" with [log.info]. This allows the main thread to continue executing without waiting for the forked operations to complete.
