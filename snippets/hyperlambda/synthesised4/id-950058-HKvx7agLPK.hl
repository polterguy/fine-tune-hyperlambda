// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] slot in Hyperlambda to evaluate two equality conditions. It checks if the value of the node referenced by [SOME_EXPRESSION] is equal to [SOME_VALUE] and if the value of the node referenced by [SOME_OTHER_EXPRESSION] is equal to [SOME_OTHER_VALUE]. The [and] slot will only evaluate to true if both conditions are met.
