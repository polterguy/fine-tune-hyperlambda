/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates a switch-case construct, where the [switch] slot evaluates the value of the [.input] node and executes the corresponding [case] block based on the matching value. If no case matches, the [default] block is executed. The code effectively allows conditional execution based on the value of [.input].
 * 
 * 1. [.input] - This node holds the value to be evaluated in the switch-case construct.
 * 2. [switch] - This slot initiates the switch-case construct, evaluating the value of [.input].
 * 3. [case] - Each [case] slot checks if the value of [.input] matches its own value, executing its children if true.
 * 4. [default] - This block is executed if no [case] value matches the [.input] value.
