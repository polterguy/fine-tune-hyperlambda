/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] construct to handle conditional branching. The [switch] slot evaluates its expression and matches it against the values of its [case] slots. If a match is found, the corresponding [case] block is executed. The [default] slot is executed if no [case] matches the expression. This structure is useful for executing different blocks of code based on the value of a variable or expression.
 * // 1. [case] - Represents a specific condition to match within a [switch] statement.
 * // 2. [switch] - Evaluates an expression and executes the matching [case] block.
 * // 3. [default] - Executes if no [case] matches the [switch] expression.
