// 1. `@.sql` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it should search for a node by name, and the `.` implies it starts from the current node's context. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate data associated with a specific node named "sql" within the current scope of your Hyperlambda execution.
