/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by searching for the first node named [.arguments] within the current context. It is used to locate the [.arguments] node, which is typically the starting point for processing arguments in a Hyperlambda file or function.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any arguments that are passed as children of the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `instruction` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [instruction]. It is used to specifically target the [instruction] argument within the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to retrieve the value of an [instruction] argument passed to it. This is useful in scenarios where the function needs to perform different actions based on the instruction provided, such as executing different logic paths or operations.
