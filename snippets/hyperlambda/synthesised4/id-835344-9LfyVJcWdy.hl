/*
 * This Hyperlambda code connects to a database named "magic" and performs two main operations. First, it deletes records from the "users_roles" table where the user matches the current authenticated user and the role is neither "guest" nor "root". Second, it reads from the "users_extra" table for the same user, filtering by type "name" or "email". For each result, it dynamically sets the name and value of nodes based on the type and value fields, and adds them to an "extra" node. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.connect] - Connects to the "magic" database.
 * 2. [data.delete] - Deletes records from the "users_roles" table based on specified conditions.
 * 3. [table] - Specifies the table "users_roles" for the delete operation.
 * 4. [where] - Begins a conditional clause for the delete operation.
 * 5. [and] - Combines multiple conditions for the delete operation.
 * 6. [user.eq] - Checks if the user matches the current authenticated user.
 * 7. [role.neq] - Ensures the role is not "guest".
 * 8. [role.neq] - Ensures the role is not "root".
 * 9. [data.connect] - Reconnects to the "magic" database for the next operation.
 * 10. [data.read] - Reads records from the "users_extra" table.
 * 11. [table] - Specifies the table "users_extra" for the read operation.
 * 12. [where] - Begins a conditional clause for the read operation.
 * 13. [and] - Combines multiple conditions for the read operation.
 * 14. [user.eq] - Checks if the user matches the current authenticated user.
 * 15. [or] - Allows for multiple type conditions.
 * 16. [type.eq] - Checks if the type is "name".
 * 17. [type.eq] - Checks if the type is "email".
 * 18. [for-each] - Iterates over each result from the read operation.
 * 19. [set-name] - Sets the name of a node based on the type field.
 * 20. [get-value] - Retrieves the type field value from the current node.
 * 21. [set-value] - Sets the value of a node based on the value field.
 * 22. [get-value] - Retrieves the value field from the current node.
 * 23. [add] - Adds the processed node to an "extra" node.
