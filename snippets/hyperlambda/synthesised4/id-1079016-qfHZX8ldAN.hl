/*
 * 1. `@.no-invocation`: This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "no-invocation" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its siblings and ancestors. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to check for the existence of a node named "no-invocation" within a Hyperlambda graph, possibly to determine whether a certain condition or state is present before proceeding with further logic.
