// This Hyperlambda code checks if a specific file does not exist, and if so, it copies a template file to the desired location. The [if] slot is used to evaluate the condition, with [not] and [io.file.exists] checking for the absence of the file. If the file is absent, the [.lambda] slot executes [io.file.copy] to copy the template file to the target path.
