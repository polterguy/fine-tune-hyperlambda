// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "activities" and "clients", using the "client_id" column as the joining key. The [join] slot specifies the join operation, with [as] providing an alias for the "clients" table, and [type] indicating a left join. The [on] slot contains the join condition, using [and] to ensure that the "client_id" from "activities" matches the "client_id" from the "clients" table.
