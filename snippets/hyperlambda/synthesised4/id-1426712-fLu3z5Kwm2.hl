// The Hyperlambda code checks if the content of the first choice's delta in the JSON converted to a lambda object is not null. It uses the [not-null] slot to determine if the specified node exists and has a non-null value. The expression navigates through the JSON structure, which has been transformed into a lambda object using [json2lambda], and verifies the presence and non-null status of the content node within the specified path.
