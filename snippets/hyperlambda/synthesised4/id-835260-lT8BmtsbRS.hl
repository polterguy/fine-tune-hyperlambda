// This Hyperlambda code uses the [add] slot to insert nodes into a specific location in the hierarchy. It targets the second and third children of the [signal] node, as indicated by the expression [1,2]. It then retrieves nodes named [sitemap], [allow], and [disallow] from the [signal] node using the [get-nodes] slot, and adds these nodes to the specified location. This operation effectively reorganizes or duplicates parts of the node structure based on the retrieved nodes.
