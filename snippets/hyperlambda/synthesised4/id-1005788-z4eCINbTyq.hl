/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "dp" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It is used to locate a specific node named "dp" in the current context, which is often used in loops or iterations to refer to the current data point being processed.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the "dp" node is a reference to another node, allowing you to access and potentially modify the original node directly, rather than working with a copy. This is useful in scenarios where you need to manipulate the actual data structure rather than a duplicate.
