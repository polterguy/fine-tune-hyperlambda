// The code checks if a specific property does not exist within a nested structure of a request body schema. It uses the [not-exists] slot to evaluate whether the specified expression yields zero results, indicating the absence of the property. The expression navigates through a series of nodes to locate the "properties" node and checks for a property with a name matching the value of a node referenced by [.dp].
