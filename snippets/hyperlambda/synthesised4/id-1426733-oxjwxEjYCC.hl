// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type of a node's value. The example sets a node [.foo] with an integer value of 57 and then uses the [type] slot to return the type of the node directly above it, which is "int". This is useful for dynamically determining the data type of a node's value within a Hyperlambda script.
