/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing the root arguments node in a Hyperlambda execution context, typically used to fetch input parameters for a function or an endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node. In this context, it fetches all children of the "arguments" node, which are typically the individual argument nodes passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `offset` - This iterator filters the previously selected nodes to return only those with the name "offset". It is used here to specifically access the "offset" argument from the list of arguments, assuming such an argument is provided.
