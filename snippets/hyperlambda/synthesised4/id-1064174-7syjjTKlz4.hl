/*
 * 1. `@data.read`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "data.read" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node within the hierarchy that matches this name. This is useful when you want to start your traversal from a specific node that holds data you are interested in.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "data.read" node. It allows you to access all immediate descendants of the "data.read" node. This is useful when you need to process or evaluate each child node of a specific parent node, such as when iterating over a list of data items stored under "data.read".
