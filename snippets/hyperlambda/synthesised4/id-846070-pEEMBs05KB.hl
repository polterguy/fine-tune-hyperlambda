// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda, which executes its child nodes if none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are met. Within the [else] block, the [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate and expand expressions, and the [add] slot appends nodes to a specified location in the node structure. The [completion] node is added as a child to the specified location, demonstrating how to conditionally modify a node graph.
