// This Hyperlambda code performs a database query on the "users_extra" table, filtering records based on a username provided as an argument and checking if the "type" column is either "name" or "email". It limits the result to a single record. The [where] clause uses logical operators [and] and [or] to combine conditions, while [limit] restricts the number of returned records.
