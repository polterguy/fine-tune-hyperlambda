// 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node "before" in its hierarchy that matches the given name. In this context, it looks for the first node named "tail" that appears before the current node in the hierarchy. This is useful for accessing nodes that are not direct children or siblings but appear earlier in the hierarchy, allowing you to reference nodes that might be part of a larger structure or sequence.
