// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [insert-before] slot to insert a node before a specified node in a Hyperlambda graph. The [insert-before] slot targets the node with the name "foo1" under the ".foo" node and inserts a new node with the name "inserted" before it. This operation modifies the structure of the node graph by adding the new node at the specified position.
