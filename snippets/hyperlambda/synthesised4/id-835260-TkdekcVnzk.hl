/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet performs a web scraping task using a loop. It continues scraping URLs from a list until a specified maximum number of URLs have been processed. The loop checks if there are URLs left to scrape and if the number of completed tasks is less than the maximum allowed. For each URL, it sends a signal to scrape the URL, adds the URL to a completed list, and removes it from the pending list. It also signals feedback to a channel and sleeps between iterations to avoid server overload.
 * 
 * 1. [while] - Initiates a loop that continues as long as there are URLs to process and the number of processed URLs is less than the maximum.
 * 2. [and] - Combines conditions to check if URLs exist and if the processed count is less than the maximum.
 * 3. [exists] - Checks if there are URLs left to process.
 * 4. [lt] - Compares the count of processed URLs against the maximum allowed.
 * 5. [.lambda] - Contains the operations to execute during each loop iteration.
 * 6. [sockets.signal] - Sends a feedback message to a specified channel.
 * 7. [sleep] - Pauses execution for a specified time.
 * 8. [unwrap] - Evaluates expressions before reaching the node.
 * 9. [signal] - Sends a signal to initiate a web scraping task.
 * 10. [add] - Adds the processed URL to the completed list.
 * 11. [remove-nodes] - Removes the processed URL from the pending list.
 * 12. [for-each] - Iterates over the results of the scraping task.
 * 13. [if] - Checks conditions to avoid processing duplicate URLs.
 * 14. [not-exists] - Ensures the URL is not already processed or pending.
 * 15. [strings.starts-with] - Checks if the URL starts with a specified prefix.
 * 16. [strings.concat] - Constructs a message indicating the wait time.
 * 17. [math.divide] - Calculates the wait time in seconds.
 * 18. [sockets.signal] - Sends a wait message to the feedback channel.
 * 19. [sleep] - Pauses execution for a specified delay to avoid server overload.
