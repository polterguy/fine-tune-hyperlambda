// This Hyperlambda snippet sets the value of the node [max_context_tokens] within the [model] node to the result of a division operation. The division result is obtained from the [math.divide] slot, which is expected to have been executed previously and stored its result in the node being referenced. The [set-value] slot updates the target node with this calculated value.
