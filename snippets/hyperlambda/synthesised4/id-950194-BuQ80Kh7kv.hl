// This Hyperlambda code establishes a connection to a CRM database using SQLite as the database type. It retrieves up to 15 records from the "contacts" table where the email field ends with "gmail.com". The [data.connect] slot specifies the database connection, while the [data.read] slot defines the query parameters, including the table, limit, and where condition with a like operator for filtering emails.
