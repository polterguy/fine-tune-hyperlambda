/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a node to the [.session] node. The added node has a child node with the name [role] and a value of "system", and another child node named [content] whose value is retrieved from the [.arguments] node, specifically from the [system_message] node within it. This effectively appends a system role message to the session. The following is a description of each slot in the code:
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node to the [.session] node.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the parent node of the nodes being added.
 * 3. [role] - Sets the role of the added node to "system".
 * 4. [content] - Retrieves and sets the content value from the [system_message] node within [.arguments].
