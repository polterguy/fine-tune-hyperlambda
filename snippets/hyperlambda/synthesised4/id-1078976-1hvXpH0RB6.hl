/*
 * 1. `@csv2lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "csv2lambda" in the current context. It looks for a node named "csv2lambda" and selects it as the starting point for further traversal.
 * 
 * 2. `0` - This iterator selects the first child of the "csv2lambda" node. In Hyperlambda, child nodes are zero-indexed, so "0" refers to the first child node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node selected by the previous iterator. It selects all nodes that are direct children of the first child of the "csv2lambda" node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to process or manipulate data that has been converted from a CSV format into a Hyperlambda structure. By selecting all children of the first child node under "csv2lambda," it allows for operations such as data transformation, validation, or extraction of specific information from the converted CSV data.
