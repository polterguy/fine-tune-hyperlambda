 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node, which in this case is the "arguments" node. It is used to access all the arguments provided.
 * 
 * 3. `direction` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved node set to find a node with the name "direction". It is used to specifically access the "direction" argument within the "arguments" node.
