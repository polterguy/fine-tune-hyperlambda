// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it should start the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate a specific node named "sql" within the current scope of your Hyperlambda code.
