// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specified location. It retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node, specifically the [order] and [direction] nodes, using [get-nodes] and adds them as children to the [data.read] node. The [add] slot is used to modify the node structure by appending new nodes, while [get-nodes] retrieves specific nodes based on the expression provided.
add:x:./*/data.read
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/order
