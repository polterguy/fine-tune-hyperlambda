/*
 * 1. `@.model` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "model" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "model" node it encounters.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "model" node. It does not filter by name or value, so it will return all direct children nodes of the "model" node.
 * 
 * 3. `max_tokens` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "max_tokens" from the children of the "model" node. It will return nodes named "max_tokens" that are direct children of the "model" node.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to retrieve the "max_tokens" configuration or setting from a model's configuration node. This might be relevant in a machine learning or natural language processing context where the "max_tokens" parameter determines the maximum number of tokens a model can process or generate.
