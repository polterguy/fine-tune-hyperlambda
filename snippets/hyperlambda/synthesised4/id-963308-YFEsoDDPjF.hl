// The [data.delete] slot is used to delete records from a specified table in a database. It requires a [table] argument to specify the target table and an optional [where] clause to define conditions for deletion. The [where] clause can use logical operators like [and] to combine multiple conditions, ensuring that only records matching all specified criteria are deleted.
