/*
 * 1. `@.completion`: This iterator searches for the first node named "completion" in the current context, starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy. It is useful for retrieving specific nodes by name when you know the name of the node you are looking for.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - Accessing a specific configuration or setting node named "completion" that is defined somewhere in the hierarchy.
 * - Retrieving data or results stored under a node named "completion" after a process or computation has been completed.
