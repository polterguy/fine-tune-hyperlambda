/*
 * 1. `@data.connect`: This iterator searches for the first node named "data.connect" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, returning the first match it finds. This is useful for locating specific nodes that may be defined earlier in the structure or higher up in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node returned by the previous iterator. In this case, it fetches all children of the "data.connect" node. This is useful for accessing all elements or configurations related to a particular node.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read`: This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to include only nodes named "data.read". It is used to narrow down the selection to specific nodes of interest, which in this case are nodes that likely contain or pertain to data reading operations.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a scenario where you need to find and process all "data.read" operations that are children of a "data.connect" node. This might be relevant in a data processing pipeline where you first establish a connection and then perform multiple read operations.
 * - It could also be used in a configuration or setup script where you need to verify or modify all read operations associated with a particular data connection.
