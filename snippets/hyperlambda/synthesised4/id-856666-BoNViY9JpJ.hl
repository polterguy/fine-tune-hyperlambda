// The code snippet uses the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve nodes that match a specific expression. It targets nodes within the [.arguments] node, specifically looking for children nodes of [ml_training_snippets] that have the name [id] and are less than a certain value. This allows for filtering and accessing specific nodes based on their hierarchical position and value comparison within the Hyperlambda graph.
