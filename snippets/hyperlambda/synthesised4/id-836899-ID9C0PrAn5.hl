// This Hyperlambda code sets an HTTP response header to control caching behavior. By using the [response.headers.set] slot, it specifies a "Cache-Control" header with the value "public, max-age=300", indicating that the response can be cached by any cache and should be considered fresh for 300 seconds. This helps in optimizing network performance by reducing the need for repeated requests for the same resource.
