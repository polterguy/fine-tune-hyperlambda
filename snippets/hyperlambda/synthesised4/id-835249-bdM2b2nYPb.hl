// The code throws an exception with the message "Malformatted function invocation". It sets the HTTP status code to 400, marks the exception as public to ensure it propagates to the client, even in release builds, if not caught by a [.catch] block. The slots used are: [throw] to raise the exception, [status] to set the HTTP status code, and [public] to make the exception visible to the client.
