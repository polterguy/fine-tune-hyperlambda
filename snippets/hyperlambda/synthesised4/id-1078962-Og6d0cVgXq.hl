/*
 * 1. `@html2lambda`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "html2lambda" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by its name, which is useful when you know the exact node you want to work with.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all the children of the node found by the previous iterator. It is used to access all immediate child nodes of the "html2lambda" node. This is useful when you need to process or manipulate all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract or manipulate all child nodes of an "html2lambda" node, which might represent a structured HTML-to-Hyperlambda conversion process. For example, if "html2lambda" is a node containing HTML elements converted to Hyperlambda, this expression allows you to access and process each converted element.
