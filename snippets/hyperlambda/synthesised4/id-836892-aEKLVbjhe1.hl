// This Hyperlambda code modifies the name of nodes located at a specific path, appending an aggregate function and column to create a new name. The [set-name] slot targets nodes under [data.read] and [columns], appending a concatenated string formed by [strings.concat], which combines the values of [aggregate_function] and [aggregate_column] from the [.arguments] node, enclosed in parentheses. This effectively renames nodes to reflect SQL-like aggregate function calls.
