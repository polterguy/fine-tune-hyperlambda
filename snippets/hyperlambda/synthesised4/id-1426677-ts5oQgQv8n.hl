/*
 * This Hyperlambda code updates records in the "ml_types" table, setting the "system_message" field to the value obtained from the "execute" node. The update is applied to records where the "type" field matches the value of the "type" node. The [data.update] slot is used to perform the update operation, with [values] specifying the fields to update and [where] defining the condition for selecting records to update.
 * 
 * 1. [data.update] - Initiates an update operation on a specified table.
 * 2. [table] - Specifies the table "ml_types" where the update will occur.
 * 3. [values] - Defines the fields and values to be updated.
 * 4. [system_message] - Sets the "system_message" field to the value from the "execute" node.
 * 5. [where] - Specifies the condition for selecting records to update.
 * 6. [and] - Logical operator to combine multiple conditions (though only one condition is used here).
 * 7. [type.eq] - Condition to match the "type" field with the value of the "type" node.
