/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to perform a SQL query on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "EmployeeTerritories" table. The query utilizes a left join with the "Employees" table, aliasing it as "EmployeeID". The join condition is based on matching the "EmployeeID" from both tables. The code specifies the columns to be selected, including an aggregate function which is aliased as "result". The query also includes a "where" clause with an "and" condition, although the specific conditions are not detailed in the snippet. Additionally, the query groups the results by a specified "group_column". Finally, the code uses the [return-nodes] slot to return the results of the query execution.
 * 
 * 1. [data.read] - Initiates the SQL read operation for the specified database type.
 * 2. [database-type] - Specifies the database type, which is SQLite in this case.
 * 3. [table] - Indicates the primary table for the SQL query, "EmployeeTerritories".
 * 4. [join] - Performs a left join with the "Employees" table, aliasing it as "EmployeeID".
 * 5. [type] - Specifies the type of join, which is a left join.
 * 6. [on] - Defines the join condition, matching "EmployeeID" from both tables.
 * 7. [columns] - Specifies the columns to be selected, including an aggregate function.
 * 8. [aggregate_functor] - Represents an aggregate function, aliased as "result".
 * 9. [where] - Introduces a where clause with an "and" condition for filtering results.
 * 10. [group] - Groups the results by a specified "group_column".
 * 11. [return-nodes] - Returns the nodes resulting from the SQL query execution.
