/*
 * 1. `@.lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "lambda" from the current node's hierarchy. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards, looking for a node named "lambda". This is useful when you want to access or manipulate data or attributes associated with a specific "lambda" node within a larger structure.
 * 
 * 2. `@.task-id` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "task-id" from the current node's hierarchy, starting from where the previous iterator left off. It is used to find a node named "task-id" that is related to or a part of the "lambda" node found by the previous iterator. This can be useful for accessing task identifiers or metadata associated with a particular lambda function or operation.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve the task ID associated with a specific lambda function within a larger Hyperlambda structure, which might be necessary for logging, debugging, or tracking purposes.
