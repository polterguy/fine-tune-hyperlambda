/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It is used to navigate to the next node in the sequence, moving downward in the hierarchy. This can be useful when you need to access the next sibling node for operations such as comparisons or modifications.
 * 
 * 2. `/**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the current node, including the node itself, using a breadth-first search algorithm. It is useful for operations that require processing or analyzing all nodes within a subtree, such as aggregating data or applying transformations to all nodes in a hierarchy.
