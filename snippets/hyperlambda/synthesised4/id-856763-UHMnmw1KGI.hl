// The code snippet uses the [not] slot to negate the boolean value of a condition. It retrieves the value of the [error] node within the [result] node using [get-value], and then applies [not] to invert its boolean evaluation. If the [error] node exists and evaluates to true, [not] will return false, and vice versa. This is useful for checking the absence of errors in a result set.
