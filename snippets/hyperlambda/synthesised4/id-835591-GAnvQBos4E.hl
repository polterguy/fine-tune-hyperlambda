// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of nodes within a specific path. It targets nodes under [data.connect], then [data.read], followed by [group], and finally [group_column]. The [set-name] slot is used to update these nodes' names to the value retrieved from the [group_column] argument, ensuring the nodes are renamed based on the provided argument value.
set-name:x:@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column
