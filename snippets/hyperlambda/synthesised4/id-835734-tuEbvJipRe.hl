// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [auth.ticket.verify] slot to ensure that the currently authenticated user belongs to at least one of the specified roles: "admin", "guest", or "root". If the user does not belong to any of these roles, an exception will be thrown, preventing further execution. This is typically used to secure endpoints by restricting access to users with specific roles.
