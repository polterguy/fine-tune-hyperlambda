// The [type] slot in Hyperlambda returns the type name of a node's value. In the example provided, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer type and a value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to retrieve the type of the [.foo] node, which will result in "int". This allows developers to dynamically check and verify the types of values within their Hyperlambda code.
