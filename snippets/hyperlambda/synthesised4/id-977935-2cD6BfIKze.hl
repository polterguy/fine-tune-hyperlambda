// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. It takes an expression and evaluates it, allowing the result to be used in subsequent operations. The expression includes iterators that traverse nodes in the graph, and the [unwrap] slot ensures that the evaluation occurs before the node is processed.
