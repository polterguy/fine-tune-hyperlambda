/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [eq] slot to compare the value retrieved from the [get-value] slot, which points to the [connection-string] node within the [.arguments] node, against an empty string. If the value of [connection-string] is an empty string, the [eq] slot will evaluate to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [eq] - Compares two values for equality.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [connection-string] node.
 * 3. [@.arguments/*/connection-string] - Expression pointing to the [connection-string] node.
 * 4. [.] - Represents an empty string for comparison.
