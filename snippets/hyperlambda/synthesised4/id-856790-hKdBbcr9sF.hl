// This Hyperlambda code uses the [remove-nodes] slot to delete nodes from a specific path in the node hierarchy. The expression targets nodes within the [signal] node that have a child node named [db] with a value of "performance_schema". The operation effectively cleans up or filters out unwanted nodes from the data structure based on the specified condition.
