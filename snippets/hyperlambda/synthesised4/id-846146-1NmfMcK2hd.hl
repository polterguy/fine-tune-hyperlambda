// This Hyperlambda code calculates the difference between the total number of snippets and the sum of snippets below a threshold and those already existing. The result is then assigned to the node referenced by [.imported]. The [math.add] slot first adds the values of [.below-threshold] and [.already-exists], and [math.subtract] subtracts this sum from [.total-snippets] before [set-value] assigns the result.
