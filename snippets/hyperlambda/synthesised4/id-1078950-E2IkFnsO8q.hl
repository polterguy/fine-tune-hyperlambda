/*
 * 1. `@.ids` - This iterator searches for the first node named "ids" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you need to locate a specific node to perform operations on its children or values.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "ids" node. It's useful when you want to process or manipulate each child node under "ids", such as iterating over them or applying a function to each.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting or processing a list of identifiers stored as children under an "ids" node.
 * - Iterating over a collection of nodes to perform operations like validation or transformation.
