/*
 * The code snippet uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and expand all expressions within the [args] node and its descendants before the node is reached by the Hyperlambda instruction pointer. This allows for the pre-evaluation of expressions, ensuring that all nested nodes within [args] are fully processed and their values are resolved before further execution. This is useful for preparing complex data structures or configurations for subsequent operations.
