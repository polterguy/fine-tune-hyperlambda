/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator finds the first node named `.dp` in the current hierarchy. The `@` symbol is used to search for a node by name, and `.dp` specifies the node name to look for. This is useful when you need to access a specific node in the current context that is named `.dp`.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator retrieves the value of the node found in the previous step as a node by reference. It assumes that the value of the `.dp` node is another node, allowing you to work with the original node rather than a copy. This is useful when you need to manipulate or access the contents of a node that is stored as a value in another node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained in the previous step. It is used to access all the immediate children of the node that was referenced by the `#` iterator. This is useful when you want to perform operations on all child nodes of a specific node.
 * 
 * 4. `Default` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name `Default`. It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes that match the specified name. This is useful when you are interested in nodes with a specific name among the children of a node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include scenarios where you need to access and manipulate nodes named `Default` that are children of a node referenced by the `.dp` node in the current context. This could be part of a configuration or settings structure where default values are stored and need to be accessed or modified.
