// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a logical AND condition used to join two tables based on matching EmployeeID fields. The [and] slot is used to ensure both conditions must be true, specifically that the EmployeeID from the Orders table matches the EmployeeID from the EmployeeID table. This is typically used in SQL join operations to combine data from related tables.
