// 1. `@.total-snippets` - This iterator searches for the first node named "total-snippets" within the current scope. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings. This is useful for accessing a specific node that might be located at various levels within the hierarchy, allowing for flexible and dynamic data retrieval. A potential use case could be retrieving a summary or aggregate value stored in a "total-snippets" node, which might represent a count or collection of code snippets in a larger data structure.
