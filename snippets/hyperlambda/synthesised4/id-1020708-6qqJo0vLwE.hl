/*
 * 1. `@http.post` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "http.post". It is typically used to access the root node of an HTTP POST request in a Hyperlambda context. This node likely contains information related to the HTTP request.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "http.post" node. It is used to access any sub-nodes that are direct children of the "http.post" node, allowing further navigation into the request's structure.
 * 
 * 3. `content` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to find the one named "content". It is used to locate the specific part of the HTTP request that contains the main body or payload of the request.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "content" node. It allows access to any sub-nodes within the "content" node, which may represent different parts of the request payload.
 * 
 * 5. `email` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to find the one named "email". It is used to specifically access the "email" node within the "content" node, which likely contains an email address or related information.
