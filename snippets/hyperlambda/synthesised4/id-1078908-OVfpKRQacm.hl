/*
 * 1. `@.task` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "task" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches upwards in the node structure, including the current node's siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node named "task". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access configuration or metadata associated with a specific task in a larger workflow or process.
 * - It might be used to retrieve task-specific parameters or settings that are defined earlier in the Hyperlambda code, allowing for dynamic adjustments based on the task context.
