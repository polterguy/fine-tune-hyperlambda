/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named [.arguments] starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot, as [.arguments] is a common convention for argument nodes in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or slot, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `aggregate_function` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [aggregate_function]. It is used to specifically target the argument or node that has the name [aggregate_function], allowing the expression to focus on this particular node among potentially many children of [.arguments].
