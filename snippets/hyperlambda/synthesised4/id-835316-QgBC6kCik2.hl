// This Hyperlambda code throws an exception with a custom message "Result too large, try to limit your result". It sets the HTTP status code to 400, indicating a bad request, and marks the exception as public, meaning it will be propagated to the client. The [throw] slot is used to generate and manage exceptions, while the [status] and [public] slots customize the exception's HTTP response behavior.
throw:Result too large, try to limit your result
   status:int:400
   public:bool:true
