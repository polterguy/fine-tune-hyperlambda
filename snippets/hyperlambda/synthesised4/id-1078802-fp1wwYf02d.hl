/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by name within the current node hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "hyper2lambda" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the specified node, allowing for operations or evaluations on each child node.
 * 
 * 3. `response` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find those with the name "response". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes specifically named "response" among the children of "hyper2lambda".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to process or evaluate all "response" nodes that are children of a "hyper2lambda" node. For example, it could be used in a system that processes API responses, where each "response" node contains data or results that need to be handled.
