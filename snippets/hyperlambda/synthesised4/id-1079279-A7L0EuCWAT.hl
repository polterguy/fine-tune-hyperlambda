// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` implies that it starts the search from the current node's context. This expression is useful when you need to access or manipulate a node named "sql" that is directly related to the current node, such as retrieving or executing an SQL query stored within that node.
