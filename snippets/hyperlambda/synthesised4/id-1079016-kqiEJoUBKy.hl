/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first ancestor node with the name "arguments". It is used to locate the [.arguments] node, which is typically the starting point for accessing arguments passed to a function or endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any arguments that have been passed as children of the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "session". It is used to specifically access the "session" argument, which might contain session-related data or identifiers.
 * 
 * **Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda endpoint to retrieve the session information passed as an argument, allowing the endpoint to perform operations based on the session data, such as user authentication or session management.
 * - It can also be used in a dynamic slot to access session-specific configurations or settings that influence the slot's behavior.
