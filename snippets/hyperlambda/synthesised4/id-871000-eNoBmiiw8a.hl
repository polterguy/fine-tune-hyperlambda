// This Hyperlambda code concatenates the values of nodes pointed to by expressions and assigns the result to a node named [.embedding]. It retrieves values from [prompt] and [completion] nodes, appends a newline character between them, and uses [strings.concat] to combine these values. The final concatenated string is then set as the value of the [.embedding] node using [set-value].
