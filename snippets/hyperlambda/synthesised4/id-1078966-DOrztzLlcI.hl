/*
 * 1. `@.msg`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "msg" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the "." signifies that it starts the search from the current node's level or above, but not among its children.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to access a message node that is defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure, allowing you to retrieve and possibly manipulate or evaluate its value further down in the code. This is useful in scenarios where you need to reference a specific node's value that has been defined previously, such as logging or conditional checks based on the message content.
