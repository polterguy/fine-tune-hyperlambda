// 1. `@.fields`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "fields" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you want to access a specific node by its name within the current scope or its ancestors.
