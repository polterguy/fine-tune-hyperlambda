// The code uses the [strings.regex-replace] slot to remove all occurrences of a pattern that matches numbers enclosed in parentheses from the value of the node pointed to by the expression [x:@.dp/#/*/Type]. The regular expression "\\([0-9,]+\\)" is used to identify the pattern, and it is replaced with an empty string, effectively deleting it.
