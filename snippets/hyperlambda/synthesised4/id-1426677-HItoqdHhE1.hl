/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [return] slot in Hyperlambda to return a single node with a value of "failure". This is typically used within a dynamically created slot or a context that allows returning values, to indicate an unsuccessful operation or status. The [return] slot is crucial for signaling the end of a process and providing feedback on its outcome.
 * 
 * 1. [return] - Initiates the return process for a slot or context.
 * 2. [result] - Specifies the node being returned, with its value set to "failure", indicating an unsuccessful result or status.
