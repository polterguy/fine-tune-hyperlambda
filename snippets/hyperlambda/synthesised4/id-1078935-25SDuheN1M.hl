/*
 * 1. `@http.get` - This iterator searches for the first node named "http.get" in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point of the expression, which is the node where the HTTP GET request is defined or handled.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "http.get" node. It is used to access the various components or configurations related to the HTTP GET request.
 * 
 * 3. `content` - This iterator filters the result set to nodes named "content" among the children of the "http.get" node. It is used to focus on the part of the HTTP response or request that deals with the content.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "content" node. It is used to access specific details or elements within the content of the HTTP response or request.
 * 
 * 5. `status` - This iterator filters the result set to nodes named "status" among the children of the "content" node. It is used to extract the status information from the content, which could be the HTTP status code or a custom status indicator.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to check the status of an HTTP response after making a GET request, allowing for conditional logic based on the status code (e.g., handling different responses for success, error, or redirection).
 * - It can be used in logging or monitoring systems to track the status of HTTP requests and responses for debugging or analytics purposes.
