/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes to a session node. The [add] slot is used to append a new node structure to the [.session] node. The new structure includes a [.role] node with a static value of "assistant" and a [.content] node whose value is dynamically retrieved from the prompt node within the current [.dp] node. This operation effectively adds a role and content to the session, where the content is derived from an existing node structure.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends new nodes to the [.session] node.
 * 2. [.] - Creates a new child node under the [.session] node.
 * 3. [.] - Creates another level of child nodes.
 * 4. [role] - Sets a static value "assistant" to the role node.
 * 5. [content] - Retrieves and sets the value from the prompt node within the current [.dp] node.
