// This Hyperlambda code checks if an HTTP POST request's status code is not between 200 and 299, indicating a failure. If the condition is true, it converts the response content to a lambda object, logs an error message with the response, and throws an exception with a detailed message. The key slots used are [if], [not], [and], [mte], [lt], [lambda2hyper], [log.error], and [throw].
