/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named [.arguments] starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is often used to locate the arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which typically contains input parameters or configuration data for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access all the parameters or configuration settings provided under the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [session] among the children of [.arguments]. It is used to specifically access the session-related data or parameter within the arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a web application to retrieve session information passed as an argument to an HTTP endpoint. It allows the developer to access session-specific data, such as user authentication tokens or session identifiers, which might be necessary for processing a request or maintaining user state across multiple requests.
