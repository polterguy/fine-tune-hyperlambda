// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to connect to a Microsoft SQL Server database and execute a batch of SQL commands. The [mssql.connect] slot is used to establish a connection to the SQL Server, while the [mssql.execute-batch] slot executes a batch of SQL statements loaded from a file. The [io.file.load] expression is used to load the SQL commands from a file, which are then executed as a batch against the connected database.
