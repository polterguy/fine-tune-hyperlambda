/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before in its hierarchy that matches the given name. In this case, it looks for the first node named "filename" in the current context.
 * 2. `.filename` - This specifies the name of the node that the `@` iterator is searching for. The expression will return the first occurrence of a node named "filename" in the current hierarchy. 
 * 
 * This expression is useful when you need to access a specific node named "filename" that is located somewhere in the hierarchy above the current node. It allows you to dynamically reference nodes based on their names, which can be particularly helpful in complex Hyperlambda structures where nodes may be nested at various levels.
