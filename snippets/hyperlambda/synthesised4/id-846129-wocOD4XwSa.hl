// This Hyperlambda code uses the [not] slot to negate the result of a [strings.starts-with] operation. It checks if the value of the [invocation] node inside the [.arguments] node does not start with the string "FUNCTION_INVOCATION". If the [invocation] node's value does not start with "FUNCTION_INVOCATION", the [not] slot will evaluate to true.
