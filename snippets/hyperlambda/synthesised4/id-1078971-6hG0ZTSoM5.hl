/*
 * 1. `@auth.ticket.get`: This iterator searches for the first node named "auth.ticket.get" in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further traversal in the node hierarchy. This is useful in scenarios where you need to access specific data related to authentication tickets.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the previously found node(s). In this context, it will access all children of the "auth.ticket.get" node. This is useful when you want to explore or manipulate all sub-nodes under a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `roles`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "roles" from the previously retrieved children. It is used to specifically target the "roles" node, which might contain user roles or permissions data.
 * 
 * 4. `*`: This iterator again retrieves all child nodes of the previously found "roles" node(s). It is used to access all individual role nodes or sub-nodes under the "roles" node, which may represent different roles assigned to a user.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve all roles associated with a user's authentication ticket, which can then be used for authorization checks or to display user permissions in a user interface.
 * - It could also be used in a logging or auditing system to record which roles are associated with a specific authentication ticket for security analysis.
