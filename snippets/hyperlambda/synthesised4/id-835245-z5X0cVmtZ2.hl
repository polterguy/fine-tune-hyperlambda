// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of [.no-invocation] is equal to 0 using the [eq] slot. If true, it executes the [.lambda] block, which increments the value of [.no-invocation] by 1 using the [math.increment] slot. The [if] slot is used to conditionally execute the increment operation based on the equality check.
