/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you need to navigate upwards in the hierarchy to access sibling nodes or to start a new path from a higher point in the structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the parent node. It is used to access every child node under the specified parent, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `return-nodes` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `return-nodes`. It is used when you want to specifically target nodes with this name among the children.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `return-nodes` node. It allows access to every child node under `return-nodes`, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 5. `urls` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `urls`. It is used to specifically target nodes with this name among the children of `return-nodes`.
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression could include extracting a list of URLs from a structured data set where URLs are nested under a `return-nodes` node, such as in a web scraping or API response processing scenario.
