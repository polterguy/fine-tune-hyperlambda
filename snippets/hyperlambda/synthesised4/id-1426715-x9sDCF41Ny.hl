/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates a switch-case structure where a variable [.case] is evaluated against multiple [case] slots. Depending on the value of [.case], the corresponding [case] block is executed, setting the [.result] node to a specific string. If none of the [case] conditions match, the [default] block is executed, setting [.result] to "Default case executed". The code illustrates conditional branching using a switch-case mechanism in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 1. [.case] - A variable that holds the value to be evaluated in the switch-case structure.
 * 2. [switch] - Initiates the switch-case structure, evaluating the [.case] variable.
 * 3. [case] - Represents a condition to be matched against the [.case] value.
 * 4. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.result] node based on the matched [case] condition.
 * 5. [default] - Executes if none of the [case] conditions match, setting [.result] to a default value.
