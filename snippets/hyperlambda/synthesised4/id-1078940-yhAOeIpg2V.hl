/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda execution context, which contains parameters passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `overwrite` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "overwrite" among the children of the "arguments" node. This is useful for accessing a specific argument named "overwrite" if it exists.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function to check if an "overwrite" argument has been provided, which might dictate whether existing data should be replaced or updated.
 * - It could also be used in validation logic to ensure that an "overwrite" parameter is present when required for certain operations.
