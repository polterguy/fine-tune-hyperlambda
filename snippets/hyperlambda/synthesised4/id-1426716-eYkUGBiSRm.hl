/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert a node into a Hyperlambda structure. Specifically, it adds a node named [execute-file] as a child of the parent node, and within this node, it further adds a child node named [_user-id]. The [_user-id] node's value is dynamically set using an expression that retrieves the value of the [user-id] node from the [.arguments] node. This allows for dynamic configuration of the [execute-file] node based on the provided user ID argument. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts a node into the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 2. [execute-file] - The node being added as a child.
 * 3. [_user-id] - A child node of [execute-file] whose value is dynamically set.
 * 4. [x:@.arguments/*/user-id] - Expression to retrieve the user ID value from the [.arguments] node.
