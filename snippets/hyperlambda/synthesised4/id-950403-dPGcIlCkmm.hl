// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else-if] slot to evaluate a condition where the value of the [.value] node is checked to see if it is less than 10. If the condition is true, the [.lambda] block is executed, logging an informational message "Value is less than 10" using the [log.info] slot. The [else-if] slot acts as a conditional branch that is evaluated only if previous conditions in an [if] or [else-if] sequence are false.
