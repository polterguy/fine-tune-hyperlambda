/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes into a destination node's children collection. 
 * // It retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node, specifically the [headers] and [feedback-channel] nodes, and adds them to the destination node.
 * // The [add] slot's primary argument is an expression that points to the destination node, and it assumes each child node is a collection of nodes to append.
 * // The [get-nodes] slot is used to retrieve the nodes specified in its expression, which are then added to the destination node's children collection.
 * // 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the destination node's children collection.
 * // 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node, specifically the [headers] node.
 * // 3. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node, specifically the [feedback-channel] node.
