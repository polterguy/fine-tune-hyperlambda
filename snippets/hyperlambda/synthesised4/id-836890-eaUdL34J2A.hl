// This Hyperlambda code sets an HTTP response header to control caching behavior. The [response.headers.set] slot is used to specify the "Cache-Control" header, setting it to "public, max-age=300", which allows the response to be cached by any cache and specifies that the maximum age of the cache is 300 seconds. This ensures that the response can be stored and reused for up to 5 minutes, optimizing performance by reducing the need for repeated requests.
