// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node. It retrieves the name of a node using [get-name] and sets this name as the value of the node referenced by [.dp]. The [set-value] slot is used to modify the node's value, while [get-name] retrieves the node's name to be used as the new value.
