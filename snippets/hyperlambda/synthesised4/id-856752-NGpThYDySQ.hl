/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specific substring in the result of [lambda2json] with another substring. It targets the substring "},{" and replaces it with "}\n{", effectively adding a newline between JSON objects for better readability. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a substring in the specified string.
 * 2. [lambda2json] - Converts a lambda object to a JSON string.
 * 3. [.] - Specifies the substring to be replaced.
 * 4. [.] - Specifies the replacement substring, adding a newline for formatting.
