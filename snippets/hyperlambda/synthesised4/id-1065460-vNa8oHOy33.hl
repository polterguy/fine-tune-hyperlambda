/*
 * 1. `@data.select`: This iterator searches for the first node named `data.select` in the current context. It is useful for locating a specific node by name within the current hierarchy, starting from the current node and moving upwards and across siblings if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator. It is used to access all direct descendants of the `data.select` node, allowing operations or evaluations to be performed on each of these child nodes.
