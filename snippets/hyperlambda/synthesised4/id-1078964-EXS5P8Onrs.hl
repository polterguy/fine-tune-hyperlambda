 * 1. `@invoke`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "invoke" in the current context. The `@` symbol is used to search for a node by name, and it will return the first occurrence of a node named "invoke". 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to find and execute a specific function or operation defined in a node named "invoke" within a larger Hyperlambda script, allowing for dynamic invocation of functionality based on the script's structure.
