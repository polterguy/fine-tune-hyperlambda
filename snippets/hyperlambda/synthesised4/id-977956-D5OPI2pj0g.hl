// The code snippet demonstrates a basic SQL read operation using the [data.read] slot to select all records from the "audit_logs" table. The [data.read] slot is used to construct a SQL SELECT statement, and the [table] argument specifies the table name from which to retrieve data. By default, this operation will limit the result set to 25 records unless a different limit is specified.
data.read
   table:audit_logs
