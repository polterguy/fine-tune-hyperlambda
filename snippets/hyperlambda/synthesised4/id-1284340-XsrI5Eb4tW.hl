// The expression `unwrap:x:+/*` is used to forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied as a value to the `unwrap` slot. In this case, the expression `+/*` is used, which retrieves all children nodes of the current node's elder sibling. This is useful for scenarios where you want to dynamically evaluate and manipulate nodes before proceeding to further operations, ensuring that any expressions or calculations are resolved early in the execution flow. A potential use case could be preparing a set of data nodes for a subsequent operation, such as a database transaction or an API call, where the data needs to be in a specific state or format.
