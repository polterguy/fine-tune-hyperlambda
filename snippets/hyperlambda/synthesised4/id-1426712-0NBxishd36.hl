// This Hyperlambda code checks if the [system_message] node within the [.arguments] node exists and is not null, and if its value is not equal to an empty string. It uses the [and] slot to ensure both conditions are true: the [not-null] slot verifies the existence and non-null status of the [system_message] node, while the [neq] slot checks that the value of [system_message] is not an empty string.
