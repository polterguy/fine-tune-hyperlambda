/*
 * 1. `@http.post` - This iterator starts by selecting the first node with the name "http.post". This is typically used to access the root node of an HTTP POST request structure, which might contain various details about the request.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "http.post" node. This is useful for accessing any node directly under the "http.post" node, regardless of its name.
 * 
 * 3. `content` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to select only those with the name "content". This is often used to access the main body or payload of the HTTP request.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "content" node. This allows access to any node directly under "content", which could include various parts of the request body.
 * 
 * 5. `error` - This iterator filters the nodes to select only those with the name "error". This is typically used to access error-related information within the content of the HTTP request.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "error" node. This allows access to any node directly under "error", which might include specific error details.
 * 
 * 7. `message` - This iterator filters the nodes to select only those with the name "message". This is used to access the specific error message within the error details.
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression include extracting error messages from the content of an HTTP POST request, which can be useful for logging, debugging, or displaying error information to users.
