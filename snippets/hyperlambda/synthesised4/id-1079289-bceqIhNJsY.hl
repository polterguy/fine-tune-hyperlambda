/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node named `.sql` from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name, and the `.` prefix specifies that it is looking for a node in the current context or hierarchy. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate a specific node named `.sql` within the current execution context, such as retrieving SQL query information or parameters stored in that node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to dynamically retrieve and execute SQL queries stored in a node named `.sql` within a Hyperlambda script, allowing for flexible database interactions based on the current context.
