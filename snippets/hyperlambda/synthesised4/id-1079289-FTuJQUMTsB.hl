/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node named "sql". This is useful when you need to access or manipulate a specific node named "sql" that is an ancestor of the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a SQL query or command stored in a node named "sql" to execute it or modify it.
 * - Retrieving configuration or connection details for a database operation stored in a "sql" node.
