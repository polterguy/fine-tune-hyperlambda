// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to query a database table named "settings". It applies a filter to select records where the "key" column is equal to "app_mode" and limits the result to a single record. The [where] clause uses the [and] logical operator to specify the condition, and the [limit] slot ensures only one record is returned.
data.read
   table:settings
   where
      and
         key.eq:app_mode
   limit:int:1
