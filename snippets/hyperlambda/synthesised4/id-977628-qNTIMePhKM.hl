// The code sends an email with an attachment using the [mail.smtp.send] slot. It constructs a MIME message with a [message] node specifying the recipient's email under [to], and sets the email [subject]. The [entity] node is set to "multipart/mixed" to allow multiple parts, including a plain text [content] and an attachment specified by [filename]. The attachment is directly referenced from the file system, optimizing memory usage.
