/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node. It sets the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.html] to the value retrieved by the [get-value] slot from the node referenced by the expression [@signal]. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [@.html] - Expression pointing to the node whose value will be changed.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node its expression is pointing to.
 * 4. [@signal] - Expression pointing to the node whose value will be retrieved by [get-value].
