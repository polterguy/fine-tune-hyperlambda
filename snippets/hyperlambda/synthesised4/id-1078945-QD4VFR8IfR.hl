/*
 * 1. `@.no-invocation`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no-invocation" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and their children. This iterator is useful when you need to find a specific node by name that might not be directly related to the current node but exists somewhere in the same hierarchical structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving configuration or setting nodes that are defined higher up in the hierarchy.
 * - Accessing metadata or context information that is shared across different parts of a Hyperlambda script.
