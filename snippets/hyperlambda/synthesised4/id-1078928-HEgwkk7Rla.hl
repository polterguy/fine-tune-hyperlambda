// 1. `@.context`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "context" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It stops as soon as it finds the first match. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is expected to be an ancestor of the current node, such as retrieving configuration or contextual information that is shared across different parts of the Hyperlambda graph.
