/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves to the next node below the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you want to access a node that is positioned directly after the current node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. After moving to the elder sibling node, this iterator will gather all of its child nodes. This is useful for accessing all sub-elements or properties of a particular node.
 * 
 * 3. `args` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "args". After retrieving all children nodes, this step narrows down the selection to those specifically named "args". This is useful when you are looking for configuration or parameter nodes that are consistently named "args".
 * 
 * 4. `**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the previous result set, including the node itself, using a breadth-first search algorithm. After filtering to nodes named "args", this iterator will gather all nodes within and below each "args" node. This is useful for accessing deeply nested structures or when you need to process or analyze all elements within a particular subtree.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to gather and process all argument-related nodes within a specific part of a Hyperlambda structure, such as when dynamically generating or validating configurations.
 * - It could also be useful in debugging or logging scenarios where you need to output or inspect all parameters associated with a particular node or operation.
