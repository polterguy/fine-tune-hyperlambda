/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot, especially in the context of dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints in Hyperlambda. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and the search is limited to the current node's siblings and itself.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `.arguments` node found by the previous iterator. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or slot, allowing further operations or evaluations on these arguments. The `*` symbol signifies that all children of the specified node are included in the result set.
