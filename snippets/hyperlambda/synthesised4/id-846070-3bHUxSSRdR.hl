/*
 * The code checks if a node referenced by [.dp] is not null and not equal to an empty string. If both conditions are true, it concatenates the value of the [.dp] node with a string " - " and the current value of [.prompt], updating [.prompt] with this new concatenated string. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Begins a conditional block.
 * 2. [and] - Combines multiple conditions that must all be true.
 * 3. [not-null] - Checks if the [.dp] node is not null.
 * 4. [neq] - Checks if the [.dp] node is not equal to an empty string.
 * 5. [.lambda] - Contains the actions to execute if conditions are true.
 * 6. [set-value] - Updates the value of the [.prompt] node.
 * 7. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings.
 * 8. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a node.
