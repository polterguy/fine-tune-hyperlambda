// The code demonstrates the use of the [fork] slot to execute a lambda object in a separate thread. Inside the forked execution, it uses [sleep] to pause the thread for 700 milliseconds before logging a message with [log.info]. This allows the main thread to continue its execution without waiting for the forked task to complete.
