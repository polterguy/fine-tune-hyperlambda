// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [case] slot in Hyperlambda to handle different conditions based on the value of a node. It checks the value of the [Crawl-Delay] node and executes the corresponding lambda block for each case. The [default] slot provides a fallback action if none of the specified cases match. This structure is useful for implementing decision-making logic based on varying input values.
