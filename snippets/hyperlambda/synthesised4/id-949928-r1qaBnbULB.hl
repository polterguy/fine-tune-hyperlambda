// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to construct a SQL query to read data from a PostgreSQL database table named "animals". It selects the "species" column and an aggregate count of records, where the "class" is "Mammal". The results are grouped by "species" and limited to 10 records. The [pgsql.read] slot is used to generate the SQL query with specified conditions and grouping.
pgsql.read
   table:animals
   columns
      species
      count(*)
         as:count
   where
      and
         class:Mammal
   group
      species
   limit:int:10
