/*
 * 1. `@cache.get`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "cache.get" in the current lambda object. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards and sideways through the hierarchy until it finds a match.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - Accessing a cached value or configuration setting stored under the "cache.get" node.
 * - Retrieving a previously computed result or data that has been stored for quick access.
