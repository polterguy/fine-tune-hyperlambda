// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to append nodes to a destination node's children collection. The [add] slot targets the [.dest] node and adds two sets of nodes to it. Each set is encapsulated within a separate node, allowing for organized addition of multiple nodes to the destination. The first set includes [foo1] and [foo2] nodes, while the second set includes [bar1] and [bar2] nodes, each with their respective string values.
add:x:@.dest

      foo1:howdy
      foo2:world
   .
      bar1:hello
      bar2:world
