// The code snippet uses the [not-null] slot to check if the specified expression yields nodes, and at least one of those nodes has a value. It evaluates the expression targeting the [embedding_vss] node within the hierarchy of [.dp]. If the [embedding_vss] node exists and has a value, the [not-null] slot will return true; otherwise, it will return false.
