// The [set-value] slot in Hyperlambda changes the value of nodes referenced by its expression to the value provided by its child node. In this example, [set-value] targets the node at [.function-result] and assigns it a new value specified by its child node. This operation is useful for updating or initializing node values within a Hyperlambda graph.
