// The code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.url] node to the value retrieved by the [get-value] slot. The [get-value] slot extracts the value of the @href attribute from a node referenced by the expression "@.dp/#/*/\@href", which likely points to a specific URL attribute within a referenced node structure.
set-value:x:@.url
   get-value:x:"@.dp/#/*/\\@href"
