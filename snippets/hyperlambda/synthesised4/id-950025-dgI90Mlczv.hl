// The code snippet demonstrates the use of an [if] statement in Hyperlambda, where the condition is implicitly true, leading to the execution of a lambda block that deletes a specified file. The [io.file.delete] slot is used to remove the file located at "/tmp/logs.txt". The [if] slot evaluates its children, and since the condition is not explicitly defined, it defaults to true, executing the file deletion operation.
