// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to determine the type of a given value. In this example, the [type] slot is used to return the Hyperlambda type name of a value, which is specified as a decimal. The [type] slot is invoked with an expression pointing to the node whose type is to be determined, and it returns the type name as its result.
