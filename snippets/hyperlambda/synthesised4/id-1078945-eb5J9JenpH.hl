/*
 * 1. `@.iterations`: This iterator searches for the first node named `iterations` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its siblings and ancestors if necessary. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve a specific configuration or parameter node named `iterations` that might be used to control the number of times a loop or process should execute.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically adjust the number of iterations based on external input or configuration settings.
