/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [openai.tokenize] slot to calculate the number of tokens required for the text obtained from the [lambda2hyper] slot. The [lambda2hyper] slot converts a lambda object into a Hyperlambda string, and the result is then passed to [openai.tokenize] to determine its token consumption. 
 * 
 * 1. [openai.tokenize] - Calculates the number of tokens required for the specified text.
 * 2. [lambda2hyper] - Converts a lambda object into a Hyperlambda string.
