/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It is useful when you want to access the node immediately following the current node in the hierarchy.
 * 2. `/` - This separator indicates that the next iterator will act upon the result set of the previous iterator. It is used to chain iterators together.
 * 3. `+` - Again, this retrieves the elder sibling of the current node, but now it acts on the result of the previous `+` iterator. This effectively moves two nodes down the hierarchy from the original node.
 * 4. `/` - Another separator to chain the next iterator.
 * 5. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current result set. It is useful for accessing all direct descendants of the node(s) obtained from the previous iterators. 
 * 
 * This expression can be used to navigate a node structure by first moving to the next sibling twice and then accessing all children of that node.
