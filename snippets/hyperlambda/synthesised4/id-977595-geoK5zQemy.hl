// This code snippet uses the [if] slot to check if a node named [item3] exists as a child of the [.data] node. If the [exists] condition evaluates to true, indicating that [item3] is present, the [.lambda] block is executed, setting the value of the [has-item] node to boolean true using [set-value]. This effectively flags the presence of [item3] within the [.data] node.
