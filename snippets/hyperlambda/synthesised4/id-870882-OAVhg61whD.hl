// The code snippet demonstrates how to execute a workflow action using the [execute] slot. It specifies the action name as "markdown2html" and points to the Hyperlambda file "/misc/workflows/actions/misc/markdown2html.hl". The [arguments] node contains a single argument [markdown], which retrieves and processes the content from the node path using the expression "--/execute/=html-encode-body/*/content".
execute:magic.workflows.actions.execute
   name:markdown2html
   filename:/misc/workflows/actions/misc/markdown2html.hl
   arguments
