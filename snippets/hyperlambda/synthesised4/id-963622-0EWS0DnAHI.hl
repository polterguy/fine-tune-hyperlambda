// This Hyperlambda code connects to a MySQL database named "crm_db" and performs a SQL query to select the "id," "name," and "email" fields from the "customers" table where the status is 'active'. The results of this query are then added to a node named "result". The [data.connect] slot establishes the database connection, [data.select] executes the SQL query, and [add] appends the query results to the [result] node.
data.connect:crm_db

   data.select:"select id, name, email from customers where status='active'"
