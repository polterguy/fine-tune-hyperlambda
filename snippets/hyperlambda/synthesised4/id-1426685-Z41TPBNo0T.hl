// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [strings.replace] slot to remove all occurrences of a backslash "\\" from the value of a node named [header] within the [.arguments] node. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first argument specifies the string to be replaced (in this case, "\\"), and the second argument specifies the replacement string (in this case, an empty string, effectively removing the backslashes). The expression [x:@.arguments/*/header] is used to point to the [header] node within the [.arguments] node, ensuring that the operation is performed on the correct string.
strings.replace:x:@.arguments/*/header
   .:"\\"
