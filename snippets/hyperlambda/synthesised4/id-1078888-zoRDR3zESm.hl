// 1. `@signal`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "signal" in the current context. The `@` symbol is used to find a node by its name, starting from the current node and searching through its siblings and children. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name within a complex node structure, such as retrieving a configuration or status node named "signal" in a larger Hyperlambda graph.
