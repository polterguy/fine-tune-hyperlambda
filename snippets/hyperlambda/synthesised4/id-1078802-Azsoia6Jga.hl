/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It is useful for pinpointing a specific node by its name, assuming it exists within the current node hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "hyper2lambda" node. It is useful when you want to access or iterate over all direct descendants of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `url` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "url" among the children of the "hyper2lambda" node. It is useful for extracting specific information, such as URLs, from a list of nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to extract all URL nodes from a configuration or data structure where each "hyper2lambda" node contains various attributes, including URLs.
