/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves downwards in the hierarchy to the next node. This is useful when you want to access a node that is directly below the current node in the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `/**` - This iterator retrieves all descendants of the current node, including the node itself, using a breadth-first search algorithm. This is useful for accessing all nodes under a given node, regardless of their depth in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access all nodes that are descendants of the elder sibling of the current node. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or evaluate all nodes under a specific sibling node in a Hyperlambda structure.
