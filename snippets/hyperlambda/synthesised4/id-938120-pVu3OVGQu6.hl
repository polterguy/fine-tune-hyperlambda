// This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the value of the [.res] node to the result of a scalar SQL query executed on "table1". The [data.scalar] slot is used to execute a SQL query that counts the number of records in "table1", and the result is assigned to [.res] using [set-value]. The code effectively retrieves a single aggregate value from the database and stores it in a node.
set-value:x:@.res
   data.scalar:select count(*) from table1
