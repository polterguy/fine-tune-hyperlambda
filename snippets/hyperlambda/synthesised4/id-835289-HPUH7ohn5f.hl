// This code checks if a node named [length] exists and is not null within the current data point [.dp]. If both conditions are met, it appends the value of [length] enclosed in parentheses to the existing SQL string stored in [.sql]. The [if] slot evaluates the conditions using [and], combining [exists] and [not-null] to ensure the presence and validity of the [length] node. The [set-value] and [strings.concat] slots are used to update the SQL string.
