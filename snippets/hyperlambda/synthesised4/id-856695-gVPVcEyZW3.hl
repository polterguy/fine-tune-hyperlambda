// The code checks if there are no nodes matching a specific expression within a nested structure. It uses [not-exists] to evaluate whether the expression, which dynamically incorporates the value of [@.x], yields zero results among the nodes under the path [../*/return/*/candidates/*/*/expression].
not-exists:x:../*/return/*/candidates/*/*/expression/={@.x}
