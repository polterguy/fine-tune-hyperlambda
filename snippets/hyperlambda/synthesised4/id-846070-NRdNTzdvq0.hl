// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the first node with the name "href" under the node referenced by [.dp] is not equal to the value of the current node. It uses the [neq] slot to perform the comparison, where [neq] returns true if the two values being compared are not the same. The expression "@.dp/#/*/\@href/[0,1]" retrieves the first "href" node under the [.dp] node by reference.
neq:x:"@.dp/#/*/\\@href/[0,1]"
