 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to execute an arbitrary SQL statement using the [pgsql.execute] slot to create a new PostgreSQL database named "magic". The [pgsql.execute] slot is used to run SQL commands directly on a PostgreSQL database. This operation is typically used for database management tasks such as creating, modifying, or deleting databases and tables. The code assumes a connection to the PostgreSQL server is already established or will be established before executing this command.
