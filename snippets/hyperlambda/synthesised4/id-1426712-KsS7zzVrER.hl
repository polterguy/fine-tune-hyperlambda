/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to concatenate a series of strings and set the resulting string as the value of a node. It uses the [strings.concat] slot to combine the current value of the [.new-prompt] node with a message indicating the success of a workflow invocation, followed by two new line characters. The [set-value] slot then assigns this concatenated string back to the [.new-prompt] node. The code effectively constructs a success message for a workflow execution and updates the [.new-prompt] node with this message.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.new-prompt] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates a list of strings into one string.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.new-prompt] - Retrieves the current value of the [.new-prompt] node.
 * 4. [.:Invocation of '] - Static string to be concatenated.
 * 5. [get-value:x:@execute/*/workflow] - Retrieves the value of the [workflow] node within the [execute] node.
 * 6. [.: was a success.] - Static string to be concatenated.
 * 7. [.:@"] - Represents a new line character to be concatenated.
 * 8. [.:@"] - Represents another new line character to be concatenated.
