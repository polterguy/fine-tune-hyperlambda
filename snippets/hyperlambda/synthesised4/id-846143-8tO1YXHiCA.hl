/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot in Hyperlambda to add a node to a specified location in the node hierarchy. It uses a lambda expression to dynamically determine the value to be added by referencing the result of a [strings.concat] operation. The [add] slot takes an expression pointing to the node where the new node should be added, and the child node specifies the value to be added, which in this case, is determined by the [strings.concat] operation.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node to the specified location in the node hierarchy.
 * 2. [x:@.allow] - Expression pointing to the node where the new node should be added.
 * 3. [.] - Child node specifying the value to be added.
 * 4. [x:@strings.concat] - Lambda expression dynamically determining the value to be added by referencing the result of a [strings.concat] operation.
