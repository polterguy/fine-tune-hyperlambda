// This code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a collection. It retrieves nodes using [get-nodes] from the [.arguments] node for both [limit] and [offset], and appends them to the children of the current node's parent. The [add] slot is used to modify the node structure dynamically by incorporating the specified nodes into the existing hierarchy.
