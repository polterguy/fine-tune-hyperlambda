// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a new node to the [.session] node. The added node contains a child node with the name [.], which further contains two child nodes: [role] and [content]. The [role] node is assigned the static value "system", while the [content] node is assigned a value dynamically retrieved from the [context] node within the [signal] node. This structure is useful for organizing session data, particularly when you want to store system roles and context information retrieved from a signal.
