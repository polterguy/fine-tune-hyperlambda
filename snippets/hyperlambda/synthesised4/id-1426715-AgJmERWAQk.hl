// This Hyperlambda code calculates the maximum context and request tokens for a model by dividing the result of subtracting the model's maximum tokens from 4096 by 2. It then sets these calculated values as the model's maximum context and request tokens. The code uses [math.subtract] to perform the subtraction and [math.divide] to divide the result by 2. The [set-value] slots are used to assign the calculated values to the appropriate nodes in the model.
