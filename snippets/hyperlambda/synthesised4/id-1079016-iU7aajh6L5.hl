 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name from the current context. In this case, it looks for the first node named "result" in the current hierarchy. It is useful when you need to access a specific node by name within the current scope.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to access a node named "result" to either retrieve its value or perform operations on it, such as updating its value or using it in further calculations.
