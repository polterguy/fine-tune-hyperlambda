// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to query a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "clients" table. It selects an aggregate function, aliasing its result as "result", and applies a [where] clause with an [and] condition. The query limits the result to a single record by setting the [limit] to 1.
