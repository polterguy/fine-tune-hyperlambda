// The [lambda2hyper] slot converts a specified lambda object into a Hyperlambda string representation. In this example, it takes the lambda object at the location specified by the expression [@http.post] and transforms it into a Hyperlambda string. This allows for easy transfer or persistence of the lambda structure, making it suitable for scenarios where you need to serialize and store or transmit the lambda object.
