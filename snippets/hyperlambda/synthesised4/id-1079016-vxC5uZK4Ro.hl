// 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node named "new-prompt" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, looking for the specified node name. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node that might be located at various levels above the current node in the hierarchy. A potential use case could be when you have a configuration or a setting node named "new-prompt" that you want to access from different parts of your Hyperlambda code.
