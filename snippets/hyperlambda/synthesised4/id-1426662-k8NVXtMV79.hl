/*
 * The code iterates through each node in the current context using [for-each]. For each node, it sends a signal using the [signal] slot, then adds the nodes returned by the signal to the next sibling node using [add]. Finally, it adds a node to the "lambda2hyper" node using [add]. 
 * 
 * 1. [for-each] - Iterates through each node in the current context.
 * 2. [signal] - Sends a signal for the current node.
 * 3. [add] - Adds nodes returned by the signal to the next sibling node.
 * 4. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes returned by the signal.
 * 5. [add] - Adds a node to the "lambda2hyper" node.
