// This Hyperlambda code snippet replaces all occurrences of the "/" character in the value of the [.type] node with an underscore ("_"). It uses [strings.replace] to perform the substitution and [set-value] to update the [.type] node with the modified string. The process involves referencing the [.type] node, applying the replacement, and then setting the new value back to the [.type] node.
