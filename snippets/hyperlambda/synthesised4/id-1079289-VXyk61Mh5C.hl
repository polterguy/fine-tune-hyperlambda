/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator looks for the first node named "sql" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards through the hierarchy of nodes until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate the "sql" node in a Hyperlambda graph, particularly when dealing with SQL queries or database-related operations. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used in a scenario where you need to access a SQL query node within a larger Hyperlambda structure, possibly to modify the query or extract information for further processing.
