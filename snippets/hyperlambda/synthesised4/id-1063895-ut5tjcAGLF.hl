 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is used to locate the node where the arguments for the current operation or function are stored.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument node within the `.arguments` node, allowing further operations or evaluations on these child nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `cascading` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `cascading` among the children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to specifically target and work with nodes that have the name `cascading`, which might represent a specific parameter or configuration in the context of the operation being performed.
