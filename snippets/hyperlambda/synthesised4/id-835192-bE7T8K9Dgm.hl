// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node is reached, transforming dynamic expressions into static values. In this example, [unwrap] is applied to the next sibling node, ensuring its value is evaluated and set before the execution pointer reaches it. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions in lambda objects, allowing for dynamic expression resolution before execution.
