// This Hyperlambda code constructs a URL by concatenating the scheme, "://", and the host from an HTTP request, and assigns it to the [.url] node. The [set-value] slot is used to set the value of [.url], while [strings.concat] combines the scheme and host into a complete URL. [get-value] retrieves the scheme, and [request.host] provides the host part of the URL.
