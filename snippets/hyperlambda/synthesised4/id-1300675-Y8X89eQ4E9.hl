// The Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to read data from a database table named "Album". It specifies the columns "Title" and "AlbumId" to be retrieved. The [where] clause is used to filter the results based on a condition that checks if the "ArtistId" of the "Album" table is equal to the "ArtistId" value found in the current data context, which is accessed using the expression `x:@.dp/#/*/ArtistId`. The [yield] slot is then used to return the result of the data read operation, specifically the nodes retrieved by the [data.read] invocation. This allows for the extraction and manipulation of album data based on the specified artist criteria.
