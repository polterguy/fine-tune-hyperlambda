// This Hyperlambda code snippet constructs a SQL delete statement by concatenating strings and a value retrieved from a data read operation. It uses [set-value] to assign the result to a [.sql] node, where [strings.concat] combines a static SQL string with a dynamic value obtained from [get-value] pointing to a [data.read] operation, forming a complete SQL query.
set-value:x:@.sql
