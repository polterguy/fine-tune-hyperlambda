// Sets the HTTP response header "Cache-Control" to "public, max-age=300", which instructs the client to cache the response for 300 seconds. This is useful for optimizing performance by reducing server load and improving response times for frequently requested resources. The [response.headers.set] slot is used to modify HTTP headers before sending the response back to the client.
