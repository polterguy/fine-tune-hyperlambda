// This Hyperlambda code snippet updates the value of nodes within the [result] node by adding 1 to each of them. It uses [set-value] to modify the value of each node identified by [get-name] within [result], and [math.add] to perform the addition operation. The [get-value] retrieves the current value of each node to which 1 is added.
