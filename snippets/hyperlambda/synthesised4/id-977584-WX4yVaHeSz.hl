// The code uses [set-value] to assign the result of a mathematical addition to the [.no] node. The [math.add] slot adds two integer values, 3 and 5, and the result, 8, is set as the value of [.no]. This demonstrates how to perform arithmetic operations and assign the result to a node in Hyperlambda.
