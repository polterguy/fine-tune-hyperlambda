// The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to the specified role, in this case, "guest". If the user does not belong to the "guest" role, the slot will throw an exception. This is typically used within an HTTP endpoint to ensure that only users with the appropriate role can access certain functionality.
