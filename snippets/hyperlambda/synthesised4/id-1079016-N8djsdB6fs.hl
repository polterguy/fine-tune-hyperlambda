/*
 * 1. `@.only-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "only-prompt" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a match. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is hierarchically above the current context, ensuring that you retrieve the closest "only-prompt" node in the ancestry. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or settings nodes that are defined at a higher level in the hierarchy.
 * - Retrieving metadata or context-specific information that applies to a broader scope than the current node.
