// 1. `@.x` - This iterator searches for the first node named "x" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It returns the first node it encounters with the specified name. This is useful when you need to find a specific node that exists higher up in the hierarchy without traversing siblings, only direct ancestors.
