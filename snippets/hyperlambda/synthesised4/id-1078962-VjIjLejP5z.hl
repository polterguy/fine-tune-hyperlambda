/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate upwards in the hierarchy of nodes.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously retrieved node set. It is used to access all direct descendants.
 * 3. `return` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved node set to include only nodes with the name "return". It is used to find specific nodes by name.
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously filtered "return" nodes. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "return" nodes.
 * 5. `urls` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved node set to include only nodes with the name "urls". It is used to find specific nodes by name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve all "urls" nodes that are children of "return" nodes, which are themselves children of the parent node of the current node. This might be useful in a context where you need to gather all URL information returned by a function or process.
