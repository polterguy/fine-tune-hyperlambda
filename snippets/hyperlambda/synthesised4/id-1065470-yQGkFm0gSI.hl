/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a Hyperlambda slot or function, as arguments are often encapsulated within an `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each individual argument that has been passed to the slot or function.
 * 
 * 3. `query`: This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes that have the name `query`. It is used to specifically target the argument named `query` within the `.arguments` node, which might be used to hold a query string or similar data in the context of the function or slot execution.
