// This Hyperlambda code creates a multipart MIME message with two entities. The first entity is a plain text file attachment specified by its filename "/README.md", while the second entity contains plain text content with the value "Bar". This structure is useful for constructing MIME messages with both file attachments and inline text content.
mime.create:multipart/mixed
   entity:text/plain
      filename:/README.md
   entity:text/plain
      content:Bar
