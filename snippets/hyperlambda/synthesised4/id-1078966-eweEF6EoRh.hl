 * 1. `@.tmp`: This iterator searches for the first node named "tmp" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It will return the first matching node it encounters. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to access a temporary or intermediate node named "tmp" that might store temporary data or state information needed for further processing in a Hyperlambda script.
