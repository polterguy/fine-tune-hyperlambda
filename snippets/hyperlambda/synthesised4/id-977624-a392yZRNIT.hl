/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to move a file to a new location by constructing the destination path using [strings.concat]. It retrieves the folder path of the old file using [io.path.get-folder] and appends the new file name from the arguments. The [io.file.move] slot then moves the file from the old location to the newly constructed path. 
 * 
 * 1. [io.file.move] - Moves the file from the old location to the new path.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates the folder path and new file name to form the destination path.
 * 3. [io.path.get-folder] - Retrieves the folder path of the old file.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the new file name from the arguments.
