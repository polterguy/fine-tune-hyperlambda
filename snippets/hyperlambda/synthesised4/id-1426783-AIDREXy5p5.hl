// This Hyperlambda code checks if the status code of an HTTP POST request is less than 300. If the condition is true, it implies that the HTTP request was successful, as status codes below 300 generally indicate successful responses. The [lt] slot is used for the "less than" comparison, and the expression [x:@http.post] retrieves the status code from the HTTP POST request. The static value 300 is used as the threshold for comparison.
lt:x:@http.post
