/*
 * 1. `@.hook-url`: This iterator searches for the first node named "hook-url" within the current node's context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for retrieving configuration or endpoint URLs that are defined in a parent or ancestor node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a webhook URL that is configured in a parent node for use in sending HTTP requests.
 * - Accessing a predefined URL for an API endpoint that needs to be dynamically referenced in a Hyperlambda script.
