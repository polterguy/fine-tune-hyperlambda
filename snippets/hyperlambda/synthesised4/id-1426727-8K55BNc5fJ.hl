// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of [total] in the [signal] node is greater than the value retrieved by [get-count]. If true, it concatenates a warning message indicating that the site contains more URLs than can be scraped. It then sends this message through a feedback channel and pauses execution for 100 milliseconds. The code uses [else-if] for conditional branching, [mt] for comparison, [strings.concat] for message construction, [unwrap] to evaluate expressions, [sockets.signal] to send the message, and [sleep] to delay execution.
