// The code concatenates strings to form a SQL primary key definition. It retrieves the primary key type and length from the arguments, and combines them with additional static strings to create a complete SQL primary key declaration. The resulting string specifies the primary key type, length, and constraints, ensuring the key is not null.
strings.concat
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/pkType
   .:(
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/pkLength
   .:) not null primary key
