 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate upwards in the hierarchy from the current node's position.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access every direct child node without filtering by name.
 * 3. `http.get` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "http.get". It is used to specifically target nodes named "http.get" among the children nodes retrieved by the previous `*` iterator.
