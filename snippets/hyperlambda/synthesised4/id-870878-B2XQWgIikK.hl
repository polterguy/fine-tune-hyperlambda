// The Hyperlambda code executes a workflow action named "http-get" by invoking a file located at "/misc/workflows/actions/http/http-get.hl". It passes the URL argument from the current context into the workflow action, allowing it to perform an HTTP GET request using the specified URL. The [execute] slot triggers the action, while [name], [filename], and [arguments] specify the action's details and input parameters.
