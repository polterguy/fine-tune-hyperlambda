// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Orders" and "Employees", using the "EmployeeID" column as the joining key. The [join] slot specifies the table to join, while the [as] slot assigns an alias to the "Employees" table. The [type] slot indicates a left join, and the [on] slot defines the condition for the join using an [and] logical operator to match the "EmployeeID" columns from both tables.
join:Employees
   as:EmployeeID
   type:left

      and
         Orders.EmployeeID:EmployeeID.EmployeeID
