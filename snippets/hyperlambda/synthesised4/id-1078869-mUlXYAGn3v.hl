/*
 * 1. `@auth.token.verify` - This iterator searches for the first node named "auth.token.verify" in the current context. It is used to locate the specific node where the verification of an authentication token might be defined or stored.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "auth.token.verify" node. It is useful for accessing any sub-nodes or elements that are part of the token verification process, such as metadata or additional verification parameters.
 * 
 * 3. `name` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "name" among the children of the "auth.token.verify" node. This is typically used to extract the name associated with the token, which could represent the user or entity that the token is linked to.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting the username or entity name from a verified authentication token for logging or auditing purposes.
 * - Displaying the name of the authenticated user in a user interface after successful token verification.
