// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.delete] slot to delete a record from the "users" table. It specifies a [where] condition using the [and] slot to ensure that only the record with an ID matching the provided argument is deleted. The [id.eq] slot compares the "id" field in the "users" table with the value of the "id" argument passed into the lambda.
data.delete
