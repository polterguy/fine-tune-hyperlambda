// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a substring within a string. It retrieves the "what" and "with" values from the current node's data, specified by [.dp], and performs the replacement operation on the string located at [.result]. The [get-value] slots are used to fetch the specific values needed for the replacement process.
strings.replace:x:@.result
   get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/what
   get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/with
