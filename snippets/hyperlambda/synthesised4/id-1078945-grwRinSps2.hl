/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node. It is used to move to the next node in the sequence, which can be useful when you want to perform operations on nodes that are sequentially arranged.
 * 
 * 2. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, which is useful when you need to iterate over or manipulate multiple child nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `/*` - This second `/*` iterator again retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to further drill down into the hierarchy, accessing the next level of child nodes.
 * 
 * 4. `/.sse` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node and then filters to find a child node named `.sse`. It is used to locate a specific node within a parent, which is useful for accessing specific data or configuration settings.
 * 
 * 5. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.sse` node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the `.sse` node, which can be useful for processing or analyzing data contained within these nodes.
 * 
 * 6. `/.session` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node and then filters to find a child node named `.session`. It is used to locate a specific session-related node within a parent, which is useful for accessing session data or managing session-related operations.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include navigating a complex data structure to access session information stored within a specific part of the hierarchy, such as retrieving session details for processing or validation purposes.
