/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to navigate to the top of the node hierarchy, allowing access to any part of the Hyperlambda structure from the root.
 * 
 * 2. `**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the current node, including the node itself, using a "breadth-first" algorithm. It is used to search through the entire node hierarchy starting from the root node to find any node that matches the subsequent criteria.
 * 
 * 3. `mail.smtp.send` - This part of the expression filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "mail.smtp.send". It is used to locate the specific node related to sending SMTP mail within the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "mail.smtp.send" node. It is used to access the various components or settings related to the SMTP mail sending process.
 * 
 * 5. `message` - This part of the expression filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "message". It is used to locate the specific node that contains the message details within the SMTP mail sending process.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "message" node. It is used to access the various parts of the message, such as headers, body, or recipients.
 * 
 * 7. `to` - This part of the expression filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "to". It is used to locate the specific node that contains the recipient information for the SMTP message.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract the recipient information from an SMTP message configuration within a Hyperlambda script.
 * - It can be used in a logging or debugging scenario to verify or display the recipient addresses for outgoing emails.
