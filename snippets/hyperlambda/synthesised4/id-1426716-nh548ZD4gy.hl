 * This Hyperlambda code trims whitespace from the value of the [invocation] node located within the [.arguments] node. It uses the [strings.trim] slot to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the [invocation] node's value and then updates the [invocation] node with the trimmed value using the [set-value] slot.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.trim] - Trims whitespace from the value of the node specified by its expression.
