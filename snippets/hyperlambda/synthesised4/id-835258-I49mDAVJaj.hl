// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [lambda2hyper] slot to convert the content of an HTTP PUT request into a Hyperlambda string. The expression [x:@http.put/*/content] points to the content node of the HTTP PUT request, and the [lambda2hyper] slot transforms this content into a Hyperlambda textual representation. This can be useful for logging or persisting the request content in a human-readable format.
lambda2hyper:x:@http.put/*/content
