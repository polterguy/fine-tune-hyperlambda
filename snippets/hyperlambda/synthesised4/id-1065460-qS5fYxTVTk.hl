// 1. `@.no`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no" within the current scope. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and the `.` signifies that it starts the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you want to retrieve a specific node by its name in the current context or hierarchy.
