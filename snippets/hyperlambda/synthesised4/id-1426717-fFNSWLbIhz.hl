// This Hyperlambda code checks if the HTTP POST request's status code is not between 200 and 299 inclusive. It uses the [not] slot to logically invert the condition, which combines [mte] and [lt] slots to verify if the status code is within the specified range. If the status code is either less than 200 or greater than or equal to 300, the condition evaluates to true.
