// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the value of all nodes with the name "h3" that are children of the node "page-header". The [set-value] slot is used to assign a new value to these nodes. The expression `x:@.page-header/*/h3` specifies the target nodes by navigating through the node hierarchy to find the "h3" nodes within "page-header".
set-value:x:@.page-header/*/h3
