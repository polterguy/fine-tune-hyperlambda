// This Hyperlambda code modifies the value of nodes referenced by a complex expression using [set-value]. It concatenates strings from multiple sources using [strings.concat], including values retrieved with [get-value] from nodes in the hierarchy and results of a [strings.split] operation. The concatenated result is set as the new value for the targeted nodes.
