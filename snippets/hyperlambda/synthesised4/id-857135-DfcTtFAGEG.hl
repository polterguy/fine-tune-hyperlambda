// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Orders" and "Employees", using the [join] slot. The join is based on matching "EmployeeID" columns from both tables. The [as] slot is used to alias the "Employees" table as "EmployeeID" for reference in the join condition.
