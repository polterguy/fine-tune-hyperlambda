// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [.user-input] is empty or null using the [eq] slot. If the condition is true, it sets the value of a node named [.validation-message] to "Input required" using the [set-value] slot. The [if] slot is used to conditionally execute the [.lambda] block based on the result of the [eq] condition.
