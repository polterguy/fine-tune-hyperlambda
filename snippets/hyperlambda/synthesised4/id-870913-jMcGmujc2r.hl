// This code snippet demonstrates how to add a node to a specific location within a Hyperlambda graph. It uses the [add] slot to insert a new node with a value retrieved from an argument. The target location is determined by an expression that navigates through nodes returned by a [data.connect] invocation. The new node's name is "twilio_account_id" and its value is set to the value of the [type] argument.
add:x:@data.connect/*/data.create/[0,1]/*/values
   .
      twilio_account_id:x:@.arguments/*/type
