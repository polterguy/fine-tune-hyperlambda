// 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, looking for a node named "session". This is useful for accessing session-related data or configurations that are stored higher up in the node hierarchy, such as user session information or session-specific settings.
