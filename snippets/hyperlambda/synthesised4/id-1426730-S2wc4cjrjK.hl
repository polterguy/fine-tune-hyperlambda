/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [.value] node is equal to "AINIRO". If the condition is true, it performs a series of operations: it removes all child nodes of [.allow] and [.disallow], sets the value of [.has-seen-ainiro] to true, and sets the value of [.relevant] to true.
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if the condition is true.
 * 2. [eq] - Compares the value of [.value] to "AINIRO".
 * 3. [.lambda] - Executes the following operations if the condition is true.
 * 4. [remove-nodes] - Removes all child nodes of [.allow].
 * 5. [remove-nodes] - Removes all child nodes of [.disallow].
 * 6. [set-value] - Sets the value of [.has-seen-ainiro] to true.
 * 7. [set-value] - Sets the value of [.relevant] to true.
