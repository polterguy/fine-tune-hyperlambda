/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to perform addition on two sets of nodes. The [add] slot is used to sum up the values of nodes specified by the expressions in its children. In this example, the expressions point to nodes within the [.arguments] node, specifically targeting the [to] and [from] nodes. The result of the addition is not stored or used further in this snippet, but the [add] slot will evaluate the sum of the values of the specified nodes.
 * // 1. [add] - Initiates the addition operation on the nodes specified by its children.
 * // 2. [get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/to] - Retrieves the nodes under [.arguments] with the name [to].
 * // 3. [get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/from] - Retrieves the nodes under [.arguments] with the name [from].
