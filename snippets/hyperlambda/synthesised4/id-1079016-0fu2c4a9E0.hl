 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node named "new-prompt" within the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds the first match. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate a specific node named "new-prompt" that might be located anywhere in the current execution context. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving configuration or settings stored in a node named "new-prompt".
 * - Accessing data or parameters that are dynamically generated and stored under the "new-prompt" node.
