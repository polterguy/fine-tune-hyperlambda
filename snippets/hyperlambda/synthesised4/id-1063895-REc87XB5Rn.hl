// 1. `@.tail`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "tail" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches through the siblings and ancestors of the current node to find the first occurrence of a node named "tail". This is useful when you need to reference a specific node that precedes the current node in the structure, allowing you to access or manipulate its value or children.
