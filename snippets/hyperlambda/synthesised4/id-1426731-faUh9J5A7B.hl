/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [Content-Type] node, which is a child of the [headers] node within the result of an [http.get] request, starts with the string "application/xml". The [strings.starts-with] slot is used to perform this check, and it returns true if the condition is met. This is useful for determining if the content type of an HTTP response is XML, allowing further processing based on this information.
 * // 1. [strings.starts-with] - Checks if the specified string starts with a given sequence of characters.
 * // 2. [x:@http.get/*/headers/*/Content-Type] - Expression pointing to the [Content-Type] node within the headers of an HTTP GET request.
 * // 3. [.:application/xml] - The string "application/xml" used as the starting sequence to check against the [Content-Type] value.
