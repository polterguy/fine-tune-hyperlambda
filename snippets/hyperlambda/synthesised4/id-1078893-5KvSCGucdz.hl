/*
 * 1. `@log.capabilities` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "log.capabilities" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, checking siblings and ancestors until it finds the specified node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "log.capabilities" node. It allows access to every direct child node under "log.capabilities".
 * 
 * 3. `can-timeshift` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "can-timeshift" among the children of "log.capabilities". It ensures that only nodes with this specific name are selected.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression could be used to check if a logging system has the capability to perform time-shifting operations by verifying the presence and value of the "can-timeshift" node under "log.capabilities".
 * - It might be used in a configuration validation process to ensure that a required feature (time-shifting) is enabled or supported in the logging capabilities of an application.
