/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [yield] slot to return a structured result containing multiple nodes. It includes a [json] node that retrieves a JSON value from the [.json] node, a [workflow] node that executes the result of a [strings.join] operation, and a [result] node that encapsulates the final output. The [yield] slot is used to return these nodes as part of a dynamic slot or HTTP endpoint response. 
 * 
 * 1. [json] - Retrieves a JSON value from the [.json] node.
 * 2. [workflow] - Executes the result of a [strings.join] operation.
 * 3. [result] - Encapsulates the final output to be returned.
