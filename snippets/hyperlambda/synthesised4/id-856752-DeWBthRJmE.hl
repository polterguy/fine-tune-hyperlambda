// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds nodes retrieved from the [epochs] argument to the [payload] node within a specific segment of an HTTP POST request. The [add] slot is used to append the nodes returned by [get-nodes], which points to the [epochs] argument, to the [payload] node located in the specified path. This operation is useful for dynamically modifying the payload of an HTTP request based on input arguments.
