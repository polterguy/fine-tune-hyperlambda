// This Hyperlambda code uses the [set-value] slot to concatenate and update the value of the [.sql] node. It combines the current value of [.sql] with the name and type of a node referenced by [.dp], inserting a space between the name and type. The [strings.concat] slot is used for the concatenation process.
