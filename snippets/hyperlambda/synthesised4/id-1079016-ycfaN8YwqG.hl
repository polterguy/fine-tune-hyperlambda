/*
 * 1. `@.cont`: This iterator searches for the first node named "cont" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors if necessary. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve configuration or context-specific data stored in a node named "cont" that might be defined higher up in the hierarchy.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to access a common ancestor node's data or settings that apply to the current node's context.
