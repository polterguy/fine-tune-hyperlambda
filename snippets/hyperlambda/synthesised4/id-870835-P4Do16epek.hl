// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions. The first condition checks if the value of the [username] node within [.arguments] is equal to a specified value using [user.eq]. The second condition checks if the value of the [type] node is equal to "name" using [type.eq]. The [and] slot ensures that both conditions must be true for the overall expression to evaluate to true.
