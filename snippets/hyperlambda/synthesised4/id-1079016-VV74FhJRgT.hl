/*
 * 1. `@.url`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "url" from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that it will start the search from the current node's context. This is useful for accessing a specific node when you know its name and you want to retrieve its value or perform operations on it.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to extract or manipulate the URL value from a configuration or data structure within a Hyperlambda script. For example, it could be part of a script that processes or validates URLs in a web application.
