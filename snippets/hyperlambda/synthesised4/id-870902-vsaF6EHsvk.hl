// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [data.delete] slot to remove records from the "ml_training_snippets" table. It specifies a [where] condition using logical operators [and] and [or] to define complex criteria for deletion. The [where] clause allows for precise control over which records are deleted based on the specified conditions.
