// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node. The expression [x:@.dp/#] is used to reference the current node being iterated over, and its value is set to "visited". This is useful in scenarios where you want to mark nodes as processed or visited during iteration.
set-value:x:@.dp/#
   :visited
