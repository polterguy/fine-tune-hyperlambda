/*
 * 1. `@.page-header`: This iterator searches for the first node named "page-header" starting from the current context. It will look for this node in the current node's hierarchy, moving upwards if necessary. This is useful when you want to find a specific section or container node within a larger structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "page-header" node. It is used to access the immediate children of a node, allowing you to perform operations or further filtering on them.
 * 
 * 3. `h6`: This iterator filters the children nodes retrieved by the `*` iterator to only include those named "h6". It is useful for selecting specific elements, such as headings, within a section or container.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to extract or manipulate all "h6" heading elements within a "page-header" section of a document or webpage, allowing for operations like styling, content extraction, or validation.
