// This Hyperlambda code constructs a URL by concatenating the scheme, "://", and the host from the request. The [set-value] slot assigns the resulting URL to the [.url] node. [strings.concat] combines the scheme and host, while [get-value] retrieves the scheme, and [request.host] provides the host value.
