 * This Hyperlambda code replaces all occurrences of the string " ." with "." in the value of the [.completion] node. It uses the [strings.replace] slot to perform the replacement operation, and the [set-value] slot to update the [.completion] node with the modified string. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the node specified by the expression.
 * 2. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a specified substring with another substring within a string.
 * 3. [.] - The substring to be replaced (" .") and the replacement substring (".").
