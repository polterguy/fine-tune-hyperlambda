// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet concatenates the results of two nodes, [function-result] and [lambda2json], with a newline character ("\n") between them, using the [strings.concat] slot. This effectively combines the outputs of the two nodes into a single string, separated by a newline.
strings.concat
   get-value:x:@.function-result
   get-value:x:@lambda2json
