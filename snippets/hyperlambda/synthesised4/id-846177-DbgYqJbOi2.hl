// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [not] slot to negate the result of an [eq] comparison. It checks if the value of the [Default] node, which is a child of the node referenced by [.dp], is not equal to a specified value. If the values are not equal, the [not] slot will return true. The code is useful for conditionally executing logic when a node's value differs from an expected default.
