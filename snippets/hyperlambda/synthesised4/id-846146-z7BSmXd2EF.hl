// The Hyperlambda code defines a signal named [signal:magic.ai.html.extract] which is used to extract information from an HTML input. It takes several arguments such as [html], [url], [feedback-channel], [images], [lists], and [code], each of which corresponds to different aspects of the HTML content to be processed or extracted. This setup allows for a modular approach to handling HTML data, enabling specific elements like images, lists, and code to be targeted and manipulated as needed.
