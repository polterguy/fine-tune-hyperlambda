// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. It takes the current node's elder sibling and unwraps it, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions. The [unwrap] slot is useful for pre-evaluating expressions in a lambda object before execution.
