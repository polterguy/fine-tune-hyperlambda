// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to select a single record from a "users" table where the "id" column equals 1. It uses the [data.read] slot to query the database, specifying the table name with [table], applying a condition with [where] and [and] to filter by "id", and limiting the result to one record with [limit].
data.read
   table:users
   where
      and
         id.eq:int:1
   limit:int:1
