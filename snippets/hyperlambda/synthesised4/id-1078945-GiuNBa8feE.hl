// 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "new-prompt" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node named "new-prompt". This is useful when you want to access or manipulate data that is defined higher up in the node hierarchy, such as configuration settings or shared data that multiple parts of the Hyperlambda script need to access.
