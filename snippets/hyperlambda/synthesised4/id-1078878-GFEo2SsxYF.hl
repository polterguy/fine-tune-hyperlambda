/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the hierarchy of nodes.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node(s). It is used to access all nodes directly under the current node.
 * 3. `return` - This iterator filters the previously selected nodes to only include those with the name "return". It is used to specifically target nodes named "return" among the children.
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected "return" node(s). It is used to access all nodes directly under any "return" node.
 * 5. `input` - This iterator filters the previously selected nodes to only include those with the name "input". It is used to specifically target nodes named "input" among the children of "return" nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to navigate a Hyperlambda graph to find and process input data that is returned from a function or operation, particularly when dealing with complex data structures where inputs are encapsulated within return nodes.
 * - It could be used in a validation or logging scenario where specific input values need to be extracted from a returned data set for further processing or analysis.
