// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to modify the value of a node by replacing specific substrings within it. The [strings.replace] slot is used twice: first, to replace occurrences of a placeholder string "[[greeting]]" within the [result] node, and second, to replace backslashes "\\" within the [greeting] node with an empty string. This effectively cleans up the [greeting] node by removing unwanted backslashes before updating the [result] node.
set-value:x:@.result
   strings.replace:x:@.result
      .:[[greeting]]
      strings.replace:x:@.greeting
         .:"\\"
         .:
