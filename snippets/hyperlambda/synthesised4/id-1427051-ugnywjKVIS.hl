// The [and] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate multiple conditions, returning true only if all conditions are true. It short-circuits, meaning it stops evaluating further conditions once it encounters a false condition. This slot allows for constructing complex logical expressions by evaluating its arguments before determining their truthfulness.
