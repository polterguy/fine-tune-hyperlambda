// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a lambda object referenced by the [invoke] node if all preceding conditional slots evaluate to false. The [else] slot does not require a condition and directly executes its child nodes. In this case, it uses the [eval] slot to execute the lambda object pointed to by the [invoke] node.
