/*
 * The Hyperlambda code snippet adds a new node structure to an existing node set. It targets the [.session] node and appends a new child node with a nested structure. The nested structure includes a [role] node with the value "system" and a [content] node whose value is dynamically retrieved from the [.new-prompt] node. This operation is useful for dynamically updating or expanding a session node with additional information.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends a new node structure to the specified node set.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the new node being added as a child.
 * 3. [.] - Represents a nested child node within the newly added node.
 * 4. [role] - Sets the role of the node to "system".
 * 5. [content] - Retrieves and sets the content from the [.new-prompt] node.
