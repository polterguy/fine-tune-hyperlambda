// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [remove-nodes] slot to delete specific nodes within a Hyperlambda structure. The expression targets nodes named "temperature" that are descendants of a "payload" node, which in turn is a child of an "http.post" node. This operation is useful for cleaning up or modifying a Hyperlambda graph by removing unnecessary or sensitive data before further processing or transmission. The code effectively ensures that any "temperature" data within the specified path is removed from the node structure.
