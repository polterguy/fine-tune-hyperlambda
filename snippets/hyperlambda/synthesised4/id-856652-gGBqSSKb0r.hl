// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the value of all nodes referenced by the expression [set-value:x:@.arg/*/schema/*/type] to the static value "number". The [set-value] slot is used to update the value of nodes, and the expression targets nodes within a nested structure under [.arg]. The operation ensures that all targeted [type] nodes within the specified path are updated to have the value "number".
