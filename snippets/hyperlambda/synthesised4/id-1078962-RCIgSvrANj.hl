/*
 * 1. `@.remaining`: This iterator starts by selecting the first node with the name "remaining" from the current context. It looks for a node named "remaining" at the same level or higher in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "remaining" node. It effectively gathers all direct descendants of the "remaining" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to gather all items or elements that are categorized under a "remaining" node, which might represent tasks, items, or data points that are yet to be processed or completed.
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you need to perform operations on all remaining tasks or items in a list, such as calculating totals, updating statuses, or generating reports.
