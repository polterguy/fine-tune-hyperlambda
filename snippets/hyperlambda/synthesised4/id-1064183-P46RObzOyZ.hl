/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you want to navigate upwards in the node hierarchy to access parent nodes or their siblings.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing you to iterate over or manipulate them.
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "data.read". It is used to specifically target nodes with this name, which might represent a data reading operation or configuration.
 * 4. `*` - Again, this retrieves all children nodes of the "data.read" nodes. It allows you to access the contents or configurations within the "data.read" nodes.
 * 5. `columns` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "columns". It is used to specifically target nodes that might represent column definitions or data structures.
 * 6. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the "columns" nodes. It allows you to access individual column definitions or properties within the "columns" node.
 * 7. `aggregate_functor` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "aggregate_functor". It is used to specifically target nodes that might represent aggregation functions or operations applied to data columns.
