// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to query a SQLite database. It specifies the table "Patients" and selects a column using an aggregate function, aliasing the result as "result". The query includes a [where] condition with an [and] clause, and limits the result to one record using [limit].
