// This Hyperlambda code establishes a connection to a database named "shopDB" and inserts a new record into the "customers" table with the name "Alice". The [data.connect] slot is used to open the connection, while [data.create] specifies the table and values for the new record. The [table] slot indicates the target table, and the [values] slot contains the data to be inserted.
