/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type of a node's value. The example initializes a node [.foo] with an integer value of 57 and then uses [type] to obtain the type of the node's value. After execution, the [type] slot will contain the type name of the node's value, which is "int" in this case.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type of the node's value.
