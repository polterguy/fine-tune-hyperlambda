/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node named "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, and the `.` indicates it will search within the current node's context. This is useful for retrieving a specific node that might contain SQL query information or configuration settings related to SQL operations. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a node that contains an SQL query to be executed.
 * - Accessing SQL-related configuration or settings within a larger Hyperlambda structure.
