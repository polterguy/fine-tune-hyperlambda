// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node is reached, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, [unwrap] is applied to evaluate the expression pointing to a node, and its children, ensuring that the node's value is processed before execution continues. The expression "+/*/*" indicates traversing to the elder sibling's children and their children, effectively unwrapping multiple levels of nodes.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
