// The provided Hyperlambda code is designed to perform a SQL query on a SQLite database table named "Shippers". The query aims to retrieve aggregated data from the table, using a specified aggregate function, and group the results by a specified column. The code begins by specifying the database type as SQLite and the target table as "Shippers". It then defines the columns to be retrieved, using an aggregate function that is aliased as "result". The [where] clause is included but does not specify any conditions, indicating a placeholder for potential conditions to be added. The [group] clause specifies the column by which the results should be grouped. Finally, the [return-nodes] slot is used to return the results of the query execution, pointing to all nodes under the [data.read] node. This setup allows for flexible querying and aggregation of data from the "Shippers" table, with the ability to easily modify conditions and grouping criteria.
