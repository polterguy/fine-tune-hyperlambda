// The code demonstrates how to use the [data.delete] slot to remove records from the "orders" table in a database. It specifies a [where] condition to delete records where the "order_id" matches a given argument, ensuring only specific entries are removed. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple conditions, although only one condition is present in this example.
data.delete
   table:orders
   where
      and
         order_id.eq:x:@.arguments/*/order_id
