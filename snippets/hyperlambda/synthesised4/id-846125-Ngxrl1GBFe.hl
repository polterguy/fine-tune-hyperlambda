// The [type] slot in Hyperlambda returns the type name of a specified value. In the example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer type and a value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to retrieve the type of the node's value, which will return "int" as the type name. This is useful for dynamically checking or validating the types of values in Hyperlambda scripts.
