// This Hyperlambda code checks if the number of nodes resulting from splitting a string is not equal to 2. If this condition is true, it throws an exception using the [throw] slot. The [if] slot evaluates a condition, [not] inverts the result of [eq], which checks for equality, and [get-count] retrieves the number of nodes from the [strings.split] operation.
