// This Hyperlambda code uses the [and] slot to combine conditions, specifically checking if the age is more than or equal to 500 using the [mteq] slot. The [and] slot ensures that all conditions within it must be true for the entire block to evaluate as true. The [mteq] slot performs a "more than or equal" comparison between its argument and the specified integer value.
