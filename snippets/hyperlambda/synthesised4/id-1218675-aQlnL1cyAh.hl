// Retrieves all [where] nodes that are children of any node under the first [data.read] node found among the children of the current node. Useful for extracting filtering conditions or criteria from a data reading operation, where the [where] nodes specify the conditions to be applied to the data retrieval process. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where dynamic data queries are constructed and executed based on user input or other runtime conditions.
