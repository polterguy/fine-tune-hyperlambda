// This Hyperlambda code checks if any nodes exist under [data.read]. If none exist, it throws an exception with a message indicating that a machine learning type does not exist, appending the type specified in [.arguments/*/type]. The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, and [not-exists] checks for the absence of nodes. The [.lambda] block is executed only if the condition is true, using [throw] to raise an exception.
