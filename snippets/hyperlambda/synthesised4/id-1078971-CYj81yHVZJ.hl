/*
 * 1. `@data.read` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "data.read" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards and then through siblings until it finds a match. This is useful when you need to locate a specific node that might be a sibling or an ancestor in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.read" node. It's useful for accessing all the immediate children of a node without filtering them by name.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - The second `*` retrieves all children nodes of each of the nodes returned by the previous `*`. This effectively allows you to access the grandchildren of the "data.read" node.
 * 
 * 4. `email` - This iterator filters out nodes that do not have the name "email" from the result set of the previous iterator. It ensures that only nodes named "email" are included in the final result set.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract all email addresses from a data structure where emails are stored as grandchildren of a "data.read" node. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to compile a list of email addresses for sending notifications or for data analysis purposes.
