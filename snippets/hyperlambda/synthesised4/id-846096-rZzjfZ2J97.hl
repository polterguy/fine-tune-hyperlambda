// The code snippet uses [get-first-value] to retrieve the first non-null value from its children nodes or the result of evaluating its expression. It attempts to get a value from the [get-value] slot pointing to a node in [.arguments] named "v", and if that is null, it defaults to the static value "version". This is useful for providing a fallback or default value when a primary value is not available.
