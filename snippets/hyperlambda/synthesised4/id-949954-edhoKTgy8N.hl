/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] and [strings.trim-end] slots. It first retrieves the value of the [.result] node and then applies the [strings.trim-end] slot to remove any trailing commas from this value. The [set-value] slot then updates the [.result] node with the trimmed value. This is useful for cleaning up strings by removing unwanted trailing characters. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the [.result] node.
 * 2. [strings.trim-end] - Trims trailing commas from the value of the [.result] node.
