// This Hyperlambda code snippet converts the value of the node located at the path specified by the expression `@data.read/*/*/max_context_tokens` to a decimal type. The [convert] slot is used to change the type of the node's value to decimal, which is useful when you need to perform operations that require a specific data type, such as arithmetic operations or comparisons. If the conversion is not possible, an exception will be thrown.
convert:x:@data.read/*/*/max_context_tokens
