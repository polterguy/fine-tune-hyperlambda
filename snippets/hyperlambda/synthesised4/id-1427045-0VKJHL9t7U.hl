/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [insert-before] slot to insert a new node named [group_column] before the first child node under the [columns] node, which is a child of [data.read], itself a child of [data.connect]. The [insert-before] slot is used to modify the structure of a Hyperlambda node tree by inserting nodes at a specified position. 
 * 
 * 1. [insert-before] - Inserts a new node before the specified node in the Hyperlambda tree.
 * 2. [group_column] - The node being inserted before the first child of the [columns] node.
