/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "session" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches upwards in the hierarchy and stops as soon as it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to access session-related data that is stored in a node named "session" and is located somewhere above the current node in the structure.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Accessing session variables or data stored in a "session" node to maintain state or user-specific information across different parts of an application.
 * - Retrieving configuration or context information that is stored in a session node to be used in subsequent operations or logic.
