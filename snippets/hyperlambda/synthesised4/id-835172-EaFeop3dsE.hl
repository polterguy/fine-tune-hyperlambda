// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [throw] slot in Hyperlambda to raise an exception with a custom message "Access denied". It specifies an HTTP status code of 401, indicating unauthorized access, and sets the exception to be public, allowing it to propagate to the client. The [status] and [public] slots are used to control the HTTP response and visibility of the exception.
throw:Access denied
   status:int:401
   public:bool:true
