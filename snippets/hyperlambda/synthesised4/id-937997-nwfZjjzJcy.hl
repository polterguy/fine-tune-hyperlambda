// The code demonstrates the use of the [whitelist] slot to restrict the execution of Hyperlambda code to a specific set of slots. It specifies a [vocabulary] of allowed slots, which includes [return] and [vocabulary], and then executes a [.lambda] block where only these slots can be invoked. This ensures that the code within the [.lambda] block is limited to using only the whitelisted slots, enhancing security by preventing unauthorized slot execution.
