/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the dot before "arguments" suggests it's looking for a direct child node of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the [.arguments] node. It acts as a wildcard, collecting every child node under [.arguments].
 * 
 * 3. `referrer` - This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to only include nodes named "referrer". It effectively narrows down the search to find a specific node among the children of [.arguments].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression is useful for extracting a "referrer" node from an HTTP request's arguments, which could be used to determine the source of the request or to implement referral tracking in a web application.
