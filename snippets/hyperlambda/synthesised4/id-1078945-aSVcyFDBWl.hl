/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator looks for the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument node within the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `/data`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find the first node named "data". It is used to specifically access the "data" argument within the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract the "data" argument from a list of arguments passed to a Hyperlambda slot or function. It is useful in scenarios where you need to manipulate or validate the "data" argument specifically within a larger set of arguments.
