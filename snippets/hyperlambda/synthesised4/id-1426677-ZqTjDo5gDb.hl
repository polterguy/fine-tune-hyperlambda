/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to modify the value of a node by replacing a specific substring within it. The [set-value] slot is used to change the value of the [.type] node. It utilizes the [strings.replace] slot to find and replace occurrences of "https://" in the value of the [.type] node with an empty string, effectively removing "https://" from the node's value. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a substring within the node's value.
 * 3. [.] - Represents the substring to be replaced ("https://") and the replacement string (empty string).
