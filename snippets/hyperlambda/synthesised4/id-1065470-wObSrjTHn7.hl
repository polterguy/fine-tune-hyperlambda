 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before in its hierarchy that matches the given name. In this case, it looks for the first node named "fields" in the current context.
 * 2. `.fields` - This is the specific node name that the `@` iterator is searching for. It indicates that the expression is looking for a node named "fields" that is an ancestor or a sibling of the current node in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * This expression is useful when you need to access a specific node named "fields" that is located somewhere above or as a sibling in the node hierarchy, allowing you to retrieve its value or perform operations on it.
