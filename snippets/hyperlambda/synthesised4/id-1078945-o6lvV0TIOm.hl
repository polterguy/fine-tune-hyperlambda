/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda`: This iterator searches for the first node named `hyper2lambda` within the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary to find the node. This is useful when you want to locate a specific node by name, regardless of its position relative to the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `hyper2lambda` node found by the previous iterator. It allows you to access and potentially manipulate or evaluate all direct descendants of the `hyper2lambda` node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - You might use this expression to gather all configuration settings or parameters defined under a `hyper2lambda` node, perhaps to apply them in a batch process.
 * - It could be used in a scenario where you need to iterate over all sub-elements of a specific section in a configuration file or data structure, allowing for operations like validation, transformation, or aggregation.
