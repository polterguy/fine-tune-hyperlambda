// This Hyperlambda code reads data from the "ml_training_snippets" table, counting the number of records where the "type" column equals a specified value. The [sql.read] slot constructs a SQL query, selecting the count of all records in the table that meet the condition specified in the [where] clause, which uses the [and] logical operator and [eq] for equality comparison. The result is a count of matching records, returned with the alias "count".
