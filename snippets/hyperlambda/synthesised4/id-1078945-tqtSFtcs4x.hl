/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves to the next node in the sequence, which is the node immediately below the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate the node that comes directly after the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the result set from the previous iterator. In this context, it will retrieve all children of the elder sibling node obtained from the `+` iterator. This is useful for operations that need to be performed on all child nodes of a specific sibling node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - You might use this expression to apply a transformation or operation to all children of the next sibling node in a sequence, such as collecting data from all child nodes of a specific sibling for aggregation or reporting purposes.
 * - It could also be used in scenarios where you need to validate or modify the structure of nodes that are positioned as children of a specific sibling node in a Hyperlambda script.
