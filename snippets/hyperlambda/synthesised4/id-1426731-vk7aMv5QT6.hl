 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add a node to a specified location in a node structure. 
 * // It uses the [add] slot to insert a node at the location referenced by the expression in its value.
 * // The [get-nodes] slot is used to retrieve the first node from the sorted list of nodes, which is then added to the location specified by [add].
 * // 1. [add] - Inserts a node at the location specified by its expression.
 * // 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves the first node from the sorted list of nodes.
