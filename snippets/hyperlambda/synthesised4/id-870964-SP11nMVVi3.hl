// The code snippet uses the [else] slot to execute a block of code when previous conditions are false. Within this block, it sets the value of the [referrer] node to the value obtained from the HTTP request header "Referer" using [request.headers.get]. This allows capturing the referring URL when none of the previous conditions are met.
