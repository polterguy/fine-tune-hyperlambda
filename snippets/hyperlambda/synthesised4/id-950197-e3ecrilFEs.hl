// The code iterates over each child node of [.data] using [for-each] and updates the [.result] node's value. For each iteration, it uses [strings.replace] to replace occurrences of the value from [what] with the value from [with] within [.result]. The [get-value] slot retrieves these values from the current node being iterated, which is passed by reference as [.dp].
