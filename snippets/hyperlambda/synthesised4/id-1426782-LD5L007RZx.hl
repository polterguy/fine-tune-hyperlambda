// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database and performs two operations. First, it executes a SQL delete statement to remove rows from the "vss_ml_training_snippets" table where the "rowid" matches the "id" from the "ml_training_snippets" table, based on a specified "type" argument and a fixed "meta" value of 'woocommerce-import'. Second, it uses the [data.delete] slot to delete records from the "ml_training_snippets" table where the "type" matches the provided argument and the "meta" is 'woocommerce-import'. The [data.execute] slot is used for executing raw SQL, while [data.delete] is used for a more structured deletion operation.
