/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator searches for the first node named "result" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "result" node it encounters, including its value and children if any. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression is useful for retrieving a specific node named "result" that might contain the outcome of a computation or operation, such as the result of a mathematical calculation or a processed data value. 
 * - It can be used in scenarios where you need to access the result of a previous operation or function call to use it in subsequent operations or to display it to the user.
