/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for the first occurrence of a node with the specified name.
 *    
 * 2. `#` - This iterator dereferences the value of the previous result set, treating it as a node reference. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is a reference to another node, allowing access to that node directly.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous result set. It is used to access the children of the dereferenced node.
 * 
 * 4. `.reference` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "reference" from the children obtained in the previous step. It ensures that only nodes named "reference" are considered for further traversal.
 * 
 * 5. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "reference" node(s) obtained in the previous step. It is used to access the children of the "reference" nodes.
 * 
 * 6. `url` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "url" from the children obtained in the previous step. It ensures that only nodes named "url" are included in the final result set.
 * 
 * The complete expression is used to navigate through a hierarchical structure, starting from a ".dp" node, dereferencing its value, and then traversing through its children to find a specific "url" node within a "reference" node. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to extract or manipulate URLs stored within a nested structure in a Hyperlambda graph.
