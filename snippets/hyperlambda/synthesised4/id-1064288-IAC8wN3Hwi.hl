/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to locate the arguments node in a Hyperlambda script, which is crucial for defining the inputs to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument that has been defined under the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `group_column` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `group_column`. It is used to specifically target the node that holds the value for the `group_column` argument, which might be used for grouping data or similar operations within the script.
