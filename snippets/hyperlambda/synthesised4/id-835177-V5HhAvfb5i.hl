// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced, allowing dynamic evaluation of values. In this example, the expression [x:+/*/*/*] is unwrapped, which means it will evaluate and replace the node's value with the result of the expression before the node is processed.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*
