/*
 * 1. `@convert`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "convert" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings, until it finds a node named "convert". This is useful when you need to access or manipulate data related to conversion processes, such as converting data types or formats, and you want to ensure you're working with the correct node in a potentially complex structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a node responsible for converting data types in a data processing pipeline.
 * - Retrieving configuration or parameters for a conversion operation in a larger workflow.
