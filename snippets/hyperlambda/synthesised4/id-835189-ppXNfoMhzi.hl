// The [unwrap] slot in this example is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. The expression "x:+/*/*/*" is dynamically evaluated, and its result is used as the value of the node where [unwrap] is invoked. This allows for forward evaluation of expressions, ensuring the node's value is set based on the evaluated result of the expression before the node is processed further.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*
