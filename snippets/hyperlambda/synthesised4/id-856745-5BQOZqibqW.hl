/*
 * The code checks if a specific node exists, is not null, and is not equal to an empty value. It uses the [and] slot to ensure all conditions are true. The [exists] slot checks for the existence of the node, [not-null] ensures the node has a value, and [neq] confirms the node's value is not empty.
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Ensures all child conditions must be true.
 * 2. [exists] - Checks if the specified node exists.
 * 3. [not-null] - Verifies the node has a non-null value.
 * 4. [neq] - Confirms the node's value is not equal to an empty string.
