// This code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement to execute a specific block of code. When the value being evaluated matches "install", the [set-value] slot is triggered to update the [.result] node with the string "Installing the car part". This allows for conditional execution based on the value provided to the [switch] statement.
case:install
   set-value:x:@.result
      .:Installing the car part
