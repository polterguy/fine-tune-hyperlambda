/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It uses the `@` symbol to search for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found node, which in this case is the "arguments" node. It allows access to all the child nodes under "arguments."
 * 
 * 3. `offset`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "offset" from the previously retrieved children nodes of "arguments." This is useful for accessing a specific parameter or value within the "arguments" node.
