// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda, which executes its child nodes if no preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are true. In this example, the [set-value] slot is used to update the [.result] node. It employs [strings.replace] to substitute occurrences of the string "[[markdown]]" in the [.result] node with "false". The [else] slot ensures this operation only occurs if all previous conditions are false.

   set-value:x:@.result
      strings.replace:x:@.result
         .:[[markdown]]
         .:false
