// The Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [return-nodes] slot to return a set of nodes from a dynamic slot or a context that supports returning nodes. In this example, it returns an [error] node with two child nodes: [code] with an integer value of 404, and [message] with a string value of "Not found". This structure is useful for returning detailed error information from a function or endpoint.
