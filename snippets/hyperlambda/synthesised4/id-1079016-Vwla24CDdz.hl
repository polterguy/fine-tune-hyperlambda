/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by locating the first node named `.arguments` within the current context. It's typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument provided to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `stream` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `stream`. It is used to specifically access the `stream` argument if it exists among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression is useful when you need to retrieve the value of a `stream` argument passed to a Hyperlambda function or endpoint. This could be relevant in scenarios where you are dealing with data streams, such as processing a file upload or handling a continuous data feed.
