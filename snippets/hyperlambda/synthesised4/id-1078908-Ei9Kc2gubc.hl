/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or a slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `vectorize` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "vectorize". It is used to specifically target the "vectorize" argument within the arguments list.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a scenario where you need to access a specific argument named "vectorize" from a list of arguments passed to a function or slot, possibly to perform operations like vectorization in machine learning or data processing tasks.
