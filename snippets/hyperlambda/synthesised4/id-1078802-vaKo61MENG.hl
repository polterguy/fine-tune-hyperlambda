/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through sibling nodes and their children until it finds the specified node. This is useful for locating a specific node in a complex structure when you know the node's name but not its exact location.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "hyper2lambda" node. It is used to access the immediate children of a node, which is helpful when you want to perform operations on or analyze all child nodes of a particular parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `.lambda` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved set of nodes to include only those with the name ".lambda". It is useful for narrowing down the node set to those that match a specific name, especially when dealing with nodes that have a common naming convention or purpose.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of each ".lambda" node. This is useful for accessing the contents or further sub-nodes of nodes that have been filtered by the previous iterator.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to extract and process all the child nodes of ".lambda" nodes that are themselves children of a "hyper2lambda" node. This might be useful in scenarios where ".lambda" nodes represent specific operations or configurations that need to be executed or analyzed within the context of a "hyper2lambda" node.
