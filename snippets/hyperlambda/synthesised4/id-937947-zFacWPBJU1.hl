// This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database, dynamically adds conditions to a delete operation on the "Genre" table, and executes the deletion. It then returns the number of affected rows. The [data.connect] slot establishes the connection, while [add] dynamically appends conditions to the [where] clause. The [data.delete] slot performs the deletion, and [unwrap] evaluates expressions before returning the result with [return].
