// The Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a SQL read operation using the [data.read] slot on a SQLite database. It specifies the table "Shippers" and selects distinct values using a functor, aliasing the result with [as]. The [where] clause is prepared for additional conditions using the [and] slot, which allows for multiple conditions to be added for filtering the query results.
