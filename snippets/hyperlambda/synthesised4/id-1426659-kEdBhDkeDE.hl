 * // This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the first node with the attribute "href" from the node currently being iterated by reference, which is passed in as [.dp]. The expression uses several iterators to navigate through the node structure to find the desired attribute.
 * // 1. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a node specified by its expression.
 * // 2. [x:"@.dp/#/./*/\\@href/[0,1]"] - This expression navigates the node structure to find the first "href" attribute of the node currently being iterated by reference.
