// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [data.select] slot to execute a SQL query that selects the "id", "prompt", and "completion" columns from the "ml_training_snippets" table. The query filters records where the "type" column matches a specified type and the "id" is greater than a given value, while also ensuring the "embedding" column is null. The results are ordered by "id" and limited to 20 records. The "type" and "id" values are dynamically retrieved from the current context using lambda expressions.
data.select:@"
select id, prompt, completion
   from ml_training_snippets
   where type = @type and id > @id and embedding is null order by id limit 20"
