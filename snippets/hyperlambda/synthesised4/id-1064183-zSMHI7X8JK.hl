/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing the arguments passed into a function or a slot, especially when dealing with dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints where arguments are typically encapsulated within an [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node, which in this case is the [.arguments] node. It is used to access all the individual argument nodes that are direct children of the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `direction` - This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes with the name "direction" among the children of the [.arguments] node. It is useful for extracting a specific argument by name, in this case, the "direction" argument, which might be used to control the flow or behavior of the code based on its value.
