/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet concatenates the current value of a node with the value of its next sibling, separated by a comma, and sets the result as the new value of the node. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node specified by the expression.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple string values into a single string.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the current value of the node specified by the expression.
 * 4. [.] - A static value used as a separator in the concatenation.
 * 5. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the next sibling node of the current node.
