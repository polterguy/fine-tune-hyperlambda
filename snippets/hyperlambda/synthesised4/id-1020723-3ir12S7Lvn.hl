/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It uses the "@" symbol to traverse upwards in the hierarchy until it finds the node named "arguments". This is useful when you want to access a specific node that is not necessarily a direct child of the current node but exists somewhere in the hierarchy above.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node found by the previous iterator. The "*" symbol is used to access all immediate children of a node, which is useful when you want to perform operations or extract information from all child nodes under a specific parent node.
