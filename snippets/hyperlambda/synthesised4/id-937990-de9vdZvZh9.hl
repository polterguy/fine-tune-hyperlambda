 * The [set-name] slot changes the name of all nodes referenced by its main expression to the value specified in its source node. It allows for dynamic renaming of nodes within a graph structure, providing flexibility in node management and manipulation. The slot is particularly useful in scenarios where node names need to be updated based on certain conditions or external inputs.
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the name of nodes referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [x:@.dp/#/*] - Expression pointing to nodes whose names will be changed.
