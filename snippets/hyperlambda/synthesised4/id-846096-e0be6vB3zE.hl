// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to handle a default case in a conditional structure. It sets the value of the [.result] node by replacing occurrences of the string "[[code]]" within the [.result] node with the string "false". The [else] slot ensures this operation is executed only if preceding [if] and [else-if] conditions are not met.
