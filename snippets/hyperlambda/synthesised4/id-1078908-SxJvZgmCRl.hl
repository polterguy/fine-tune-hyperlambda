/*
 * 1. `.`: This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is often used to navigate upwards in the node hierarchy to access parent nodes.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node.
 * 
 * 3. `signal`: This iterator filters the previous result set to include only nodes with the name "signal". It is used to narrow down the node set to specific nodes of interest.
 * 
 * 4. `=`: This iterator retrieves nodes from the previous result set that have a value equal to the specified value. In this case, it looks for nodes with the value "magic.ai.crawl-site". It is used for value-based filtering.
 * 
 * 5. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node.
 * 
 * 6. `.onerror`: This iterator filters the previous result set to include only nodes with the name ".onerror". It is used to narrow down the node set to specific nodes of interest, particularly those related to error handling.
 * 
 * 7. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node.
 * 
 * 8. `.type`: This iterator filters the previous result set to include only nodes with the name ".type". It is used to narrow down the node set to specific nodes of interest, particularly those related to type information.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to navigate a node structure to find error handling nodes related to a specific signal type in a web crawling context.
 * - It could be useful for logging or debugging purposes, where you need to access and handle specific error types associated with a particular signal in a complex node graph.
