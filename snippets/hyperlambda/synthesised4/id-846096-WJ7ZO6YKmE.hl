// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda, which executes its child nodes only if preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are false. Here, it sets the value of the [result] node by replacing occurrences of the string "[[rtl]]" within the current [result] node's value with "false". This operation is performed using the [strings.replace] slot.
