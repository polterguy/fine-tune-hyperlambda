// The code uses the [remove-nodes] slot to delete specific nodes from a Hyperlambda graph. It targets nodes within the [.arguments] section of a [hyper2lambda] node, specifically removing any [_session] nodes. This operation is useful for cleaning up or modifying the structure of a Hyperlambda graph by removing unwanted or sensitive data nodes.
