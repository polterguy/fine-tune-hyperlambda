 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet evaluates two conditions using the [and] slot. The first condition checks if there is at least one non-null node with a name of "uri" within the children of the node referenced by [.dp]. The second condition checks if there are no nodes with a "uri" value equal to the "uri" value of the node referenced by [.dp] within the descendants of the [result] node. If both conditions are true, the [and] slot evaluates to true.
 * // 1. [not-null] - Checks if there is at least one non-null "uri" node within the children of the node referenced by [.dp].
 * // 2. [not-exists] - Checks if there are no nodes with a "uri" value equal to the "uri" value of the node referenced by [.dp] within the descendants of the [result] node.
