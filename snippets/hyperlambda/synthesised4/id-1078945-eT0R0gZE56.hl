/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing the arguments node in a Hyperlambda structure, which typically contains input parameters or data passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected "arguments" node. It allows you to access any node directly under "arguments", which can be useful for iterating over all input parameters or data elements.
 * 
 * 3. `prompt` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "prompt" from the previously selected children nodes. It is used to specifically target the "prompt" node within the arguments, which might contain a specific piece of data or input that needs to be processed.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing and processing a specific input parameter named "prompt" within a Hyperlambda function or endpoint, which could be used for generating dynamic responses or executing specific logic based on the prompt's value.
 * - Iterating over input parameters to find and utilize the "prompt" node for further operations, such as logging, validation, or conditional branching based on its content.
