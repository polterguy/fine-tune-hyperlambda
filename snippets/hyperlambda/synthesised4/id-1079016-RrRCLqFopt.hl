/*
 * 1. `@.iterations`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "iterations" starting from the current context and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "iterations" node it encounters. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a loop or iterative process where you need to access a node named "iterations" that might be defined at a higher level in the hierarchy, such as a configuration or control structure for a loop.
