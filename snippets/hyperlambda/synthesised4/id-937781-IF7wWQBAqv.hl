// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.update] slot to update records in a SQLite database table named "city". It specifies the database type as SQLite and uses a [where] clause with an [and] condition to define the criteria for which records should be updated. The [values] node is intended to specify the columns and their new values for the update operation.
