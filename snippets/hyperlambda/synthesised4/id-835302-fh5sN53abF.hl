// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes to a destination node. It retrieves nodes from a temporary location using [get-nodes] and adds them to the children of nodes found by the expression in [add]. The [add] slot's expression targets nodes within a PostgreSQL connection context, specifically under the [return-nodes] path. This operation effectively merges the temporary nodes into the specified destination node's hierarchy.
