/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [return-nodes] slot to return multiple nodes from a dynamically created slot. The slot named "foo" is created using [slots.create], and it returns two nodes: [integer-value] with an integer value of 57, and [string-value] with a string value of "Foo bar". The [signal] slot is then used to invoke the "foo" slot, which returns the specified nodes.
 * 
 * 1. [slots.create] - Creates a new dynamic slot named "foo".
 * 2. [return-nodes] - Returns multiple nodes from the dynamic slot.
 * 3. [integer-value] - A node with an integer value of 57 to be returned.
 * 4. [string-value] - A node with a string value of "Foo bar" to be returned.
 * 5. [signal] - Invokes the "foo" slot, triggering the return of the specified nodes.
