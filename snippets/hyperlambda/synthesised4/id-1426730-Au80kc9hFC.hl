/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a node to the [.disallow] node, where the added node's value is the result of a [strings.concat] operation. The [strings.concat] operation concatenates strings, and the result of this operation is used as the value for the newly added node under [.disallow]. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node to the [.disallow] node.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the node being added.
 * 3. [x:@strings.concat] - The value of the node being added, which is the result of a [strings.concat] operation.
