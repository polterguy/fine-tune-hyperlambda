/*
 * 1. `@data.read` - This iterator starts by locating the first node with the name "data.read" within the current context. It is used to pinpoint a specific node from which further navigation or operations will be based. This is particularly useful when you need to start your expression from a known node name within a potentially large or complex node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the node identified by the previous iterator (`@data.read`). It is used to access every direct descendant of the "data.read" node, allowing operations or evaluations to be performed on each of these child nodes. This is useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze all elements under a specific parent node.
