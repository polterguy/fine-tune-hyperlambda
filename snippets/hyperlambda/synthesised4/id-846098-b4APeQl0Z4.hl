// This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of the string "[[submit_button]]" within the node referenced by the expression "@.result" with the string "false". The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the substring to be replaced, and the second is the replacement string.
strings.replace:x:@.result
   .:[[submit_button]]
