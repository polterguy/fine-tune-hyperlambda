// The code demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to create a SQL query that counts the number of entries in the "users_roles" table. It specifies the column to count using [columns] and applies a [where] condition with [and], although no specific condition is provided. The [limit] is set to 1, which restricts the result to a single record.
