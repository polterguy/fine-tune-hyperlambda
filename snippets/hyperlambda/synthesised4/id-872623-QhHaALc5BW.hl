// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the value of a specified argument, [group_column], is one of the predefined legal values. The allowed values in this example are column names from the "users" table, including "user_id," "username," "password," "email," and "role." If the provided value does not match any of these, an exception is thrown, enforcing strict validation of the argument's value.
validators.enum:x:@.arguments/*/group_column
   .:users.user_id
   .:users.username
   .:users.password
   .:users.email
   .:users.role
