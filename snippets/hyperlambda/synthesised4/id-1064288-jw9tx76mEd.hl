/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda) of the current node. It is useful when you want to navigate to the next node at the same hierarchical level.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing you to perform operations on each child node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes returned by the first `*` iterator. This allows you to access the grandchildren of the initial node, effectively navigating two levels down the hierarchy.
