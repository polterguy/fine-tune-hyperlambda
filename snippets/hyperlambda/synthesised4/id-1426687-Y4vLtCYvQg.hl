// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [else] slot to execute a block of code when none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are met. Within this block, it uses [set-value] to modify the value of the [.result] node. The [strings.replace] slot is used to replace occurrences of the string "[[submit_button]]" within the current value of [.result] with the string "false". This operation effectively updates the [.result] node by substituting a specific placeholder with a new value, ensuring that any instance of "[[submit_button]]" is replaced with "false" in the final result.
