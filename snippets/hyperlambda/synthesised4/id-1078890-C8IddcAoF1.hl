/*
 * 1. `@.content` - This iterator starts by locating the first node named "content" within the current context. This is the starting point for the expression, and it will return the node named "content" if it exists at the current level of the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `**` - This is the "breadth first" iterator that retrieves all descendant nodes of the previously identified node, including the node itself. It will traverse the entire subtree under the "content" node, collecting all nodes within that subtree.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used to gather all data within a specific section of a document or configuration file, allowing for comprehensive processing or analysis of the entire subtree under the "content" node.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to apply transformations or validations to all nodes within a particular section of a larger data structure, ensuring that no nodes are overlooked.
