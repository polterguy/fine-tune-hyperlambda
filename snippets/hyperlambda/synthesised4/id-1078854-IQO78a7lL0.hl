/*
 * 1. `@auth.ticket.get` - This iterator searches for the first node named "auth.ticket.get" in the current context. It is often used to retrieve a node that contains authentication or authorization information, such as a user's ticket or session data.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "auth.ticket.get" node. It is used to access any sub-nodes that might contain additional details related to the authentication ticket.
 * 
 * 3. `roles` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "roles". It is typically used to access a list or collection of roles associated with the authenticated user.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "roles" node. It is used to access each individual role assigned to the user.
 * 
 * 5. `={@strings.trim}` - This is an extrapolated expression that applies the `strings.trim` slot to each node in the current result set. The `strings.trim` slot removes leading and trailing whitespace from string values. This is useful for cleaning up role names that might have been stored with extra spaces.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in an authentication or authorization system to retrieve and clean up a list of roles assigned to a user, ensuring that role names are consistent and free of extraneous whitespace.
 * - It could be used in a logging or auditing system to generate a clean list of user roles for reporting purposes, ensuring that role names are properly formatted.
