// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by finding the first node in the current context with the name "sql". The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node with a specific name, and the `.` implies it is starting from the current node's context. This is useful when you want to directly access a specific node by its name within the current node's hierarchy.
