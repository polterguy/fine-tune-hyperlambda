// 1. `@.finish_reason`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `finish_reason` that is a sibling or a child of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` indicates it starts from the current node's context. This is useful when you need to access a specific node named `finish_reason` within the current scope, such as when checking the reason for the completion of a task or process in a workflow.
