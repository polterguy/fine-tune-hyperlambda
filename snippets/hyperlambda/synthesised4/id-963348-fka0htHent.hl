// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to execute a dynamic slot named "user.full-name" by passing in two arguments: "first-name" and "last-name". The values for these arguments are retrieved from the children nodes of the [.data] node, specifically targeting nodes named "first-name" and "last-name". This allows the "user.full-name" slot to process and potentially combine these names into a full name.
execute:user.full-name
   first-name:x:@.data/*/first-name
   last-name:x:@.data/*/last-name
