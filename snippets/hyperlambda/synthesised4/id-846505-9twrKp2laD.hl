// The Hyperlambda code uses the [insert-before] slot to insert a node named [group_column] before the first child node of the [columns] node, which is a child of the [data.read] node, itself a child of the [data.connect] node. This allows for dynamic modification of the node structure by inserting new nodes at specified positions.
