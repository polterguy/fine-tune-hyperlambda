 * The code checks if the value of the node [found] is false using the [not] slot. If it is false, it executes a lambda object that sets the value of the [url] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Begins a conditional statement.
 * 2. [not] - Inverts the boolean value of the [found] node.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [found] node.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 5. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [url] node.
