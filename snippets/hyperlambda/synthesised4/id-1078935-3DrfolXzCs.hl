 * 1. `@.task-id`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "task-id" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node's siblings and ancestors. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a specific task identifier from a node structure where tasks are organized hierarchically.
 * - Accessing metadata or configuration settings associated with a task in a workflow or process management system.
