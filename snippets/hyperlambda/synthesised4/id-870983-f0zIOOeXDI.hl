// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add new nodes to an existing node by reference using the [add] slot. It targets a node specified by the expression [x:@.dp/#] and appends two child nodes: [tokens] with an integer value of 8192 and [chat] with a boolean value of true. This operation is useful for dynamically modifying the structure of a node graph by adding new data elements.
