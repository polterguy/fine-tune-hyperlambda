/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet performs a validation check on a CAPTCHA token by comparing time values. It first converts the [time-challenge] node to a long type, then checks if the sum of [time-challenge] and [age] is less than the current Unix time or if [time-challenge] itself is greater than the current Unix time. If either condition is true, it throws an exception with a message indicating an invalid CAPTCHA token, setting the status to 400 and making it public. 
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Begins an else block for conditional logic.
 * 2. [set-value] - Converts the [time-challenge] node to a long type.
 * 3. [if] - Starts an if condition to evaluate time comparisons.
 * 4. [or] - Combines two conditions, either of which can trigger the exception.
 * 5. [lt] - Checks if the sum of [time-challenge] and [age] is less than the current Unix time.
 * 6. [math.add] - Adds [time-challenge] and [age] values.
 * 7. [get-value] - Retrieves values of [time-challenge] and [age].
 * 8. [date.unix] - Represents the current Unix time.
 * 9. [mt] - Checks if [time-challenge] is greater than the current Unix time.
 * 10. [.lambda] - Executes the following block if the condition is true.
 * 11. [throw] - Throws an exception with a specified message and status.
