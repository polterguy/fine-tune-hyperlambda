// This Hyperlambda code uses logical operations to check if a specific node does not have a value. It uses the [and] slot to combine two [not] conditions, each using [eq] to compare the value of a node referenced by [get-value] to an empty string or null. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the "Default" node under the current [.dp] node, and the [not] slot negates the result of the [eq] comparison, effectively checking if the node's value is neither an empty string nor null.
