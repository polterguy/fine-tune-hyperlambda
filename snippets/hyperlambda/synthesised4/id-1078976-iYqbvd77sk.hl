/*
 * 1. `@csv2lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "csv2lambda" from the current context. It is used to locate a specific node within the Hyperlambda structure that is named "csv2lambda".
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "csv2lambda" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "csv2lambda" node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of each child node of "csv2lambda". It is used to access the next level of descendants, effectively navigating two levels down the hierarchy from the "csv2lambda" node.
 * 
 * 4. `{@get-name}` - This is an extrapolated expression that will be evaluated, assuming it yields one result. It replaces itself with the value of whatever node it points to. In this context, it is used to dynamically retrieve a value from the nodes found in the previous steps, likely to extract a specific attribute or property from those nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include processing or transforming data structures where you need to navigate through a hierarchy of nodes to extract specific information, such as converting CSV data into a lambda structure and then retrieving specific attributes from that structure.
