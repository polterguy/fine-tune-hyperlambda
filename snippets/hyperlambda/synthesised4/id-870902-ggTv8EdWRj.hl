// The code iterates over each node in [data.read] and checks if the [filename] node exists and is not null. If both conditions are true, it deletes the file specified by the [filename] node. The [for-each] slot is used for iteration, [and] for combining conditions, [not-null] for checking non-null values, [io.file.exists] for verifying file existence, and [io.file.delete] for file deletion.
