/*
 * The code snippet adds two nodes, [result] and [finish_reason], after the [return] node. The [result] node's value is set to the value of the [.result] node within the [invoke] node, and the [finish_reason] node's value is set to the value of the [.finish_reason] node within the [invoke] node. This operation effectively appends the result and finish reason of an invocation to the return node. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds nodes after the [return] node.
 * 2. [result] - Sets its value to the [.result] node within [invoke].
 * 3. [finish_reason] - Sets its value to the [.finish_reason] node within [invoke].
