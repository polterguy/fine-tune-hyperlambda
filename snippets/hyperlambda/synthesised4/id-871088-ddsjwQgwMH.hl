// The code snippet uses the [lambda2json] slot to convert a lambda object, specifically the children of the [execute] node, into a JSON string. This allows for the serialization of the lambda structure into a JSON format, which can be useful for data interchange or storage. The [lambda2json] slot processes the lambda nodes and outputs a JSON representation.
