// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of all nodes referenced by the expression [@if/./*/data.execute] to "mssql.execute-batch". The [set-name] slot is used to rename nodes, and in this case, it targets nodes that are children of the [if] node, specifically those that are descendants of a node with the name [data.execute].
