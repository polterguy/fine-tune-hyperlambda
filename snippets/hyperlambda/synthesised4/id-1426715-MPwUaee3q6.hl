/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specific location in a Hyperlambda graph. It retrieves nodes from a given path using [get-nodes] and adds them to another node. Specifically, it fetches nodes from [.arguments/*/prompt] and [.arguments/*/session] and adds them to the children of the node specified by the expression in [add]. This operation is useful for dynamically modifying the structure of a Hyperlambda graph by incorporating additional nodes from specified locations.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified location in the Hyperlambda graph.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments/*/prompt] path.
 * 3. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments/*/session] path.
