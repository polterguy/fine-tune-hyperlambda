/*
 * 1. `@.max-size`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "max-size" that is an ancestor or sibling of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node named "max-size". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to dynamically retrieve configuration settings or constraints such as a maximum size limit defined elsewhere in the node hierarchy.
 * - It might be used in a validation process to ensure that a given value does not exceed a predefined maximum size, which is specified in a "max-size" node located somewhere in the hierarchy.
