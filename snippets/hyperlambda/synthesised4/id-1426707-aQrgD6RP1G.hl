/*
 * This Hyperlambda code constructs a URI by concatenating various parts of a request, including the scheme, host, and a specific path, and appends a URL-encoded filename to it. The resulting URI is then set as the value of the [.uri] node. The process involves the following steps:
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.uri] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple string components to form the URI.
 * 3. [request.scheme] - Retrieves the scheme (e.g., "http" or "https") from the request.
 * 4. [.] - Adds "://" to separate the scheme from the host.
 * 5. [request.host] - Retrieves the host from the request.
 * 6. [.] - Adds the path "/magic/system/openai/download-txt?file=" to the URI.
 * 7. [strings.url-encode] - URL-encodes the value of the [filename] node and appends it to the URI.
