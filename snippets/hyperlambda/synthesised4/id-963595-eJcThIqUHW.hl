// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.create] slot to insert a new record into the "ml_training_snippets" table. The [table] node specifies the target table for the insertion, while the [values] node is meant to contain the fields and their corresponding values to be inserted into the database. This structure ensures that the data is properly organized for the insertion operation.
