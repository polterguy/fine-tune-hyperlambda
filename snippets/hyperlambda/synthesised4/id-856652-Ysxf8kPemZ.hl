// The code uses the [insert-after] slot to insert a node after a specified node in a Hyperlambda structure. It targets the node with the name [name] under [arg] and inserts a new node with the name [description], whose value is derived from the [description] node under the current [.dp] node. This allows dynamic modification of the node structure by adding additional information after a specified node.
insert-after:x:@.arg/*/name
