/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of all nodes referenced by the expression "./*/add/*/*" to the value obtained from the [get-value] slot. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node pointed to by the expression "@.dp/#/*/value", which is typically used to access a specific node's value in a loop or iteration context. This operation effectively updates multiple nodes' values based on the retrieved value from a reference node.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of nodes referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a node specified by its expression.
