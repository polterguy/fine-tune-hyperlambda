// The code demonstrates the use of the [if] slot to evaluate a logical condition using the [and] slot. It checks if both [.a] and [.b] nodes evaluate to true using [get-value]. If both conditions are true, it executes the [.lambda] block, setting the [.status] node's value to "Both are true". The [and] slot ensures that the [.lambda] block is only executed if both conditions are met.
