 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [remove-nodes] slot to delete specific nodes from a node set. It targets nodes named "keyword_density" within a nested structure under [data.select]. By executing this, all nodes with the name "keyword_density" within the specified hierarchy will be removed, effectively cleaning up the data set by eliminating unwanted nodes.
 * 
 * 1. [remove-nodes] - This slot removes all nodes that match the expression provided, which in this case targets nodes named "keyword_density" under [data.select].
