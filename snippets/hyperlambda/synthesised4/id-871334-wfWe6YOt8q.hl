// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL query on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "Customers" table. It selects a count of all entries, aliasing the result as "count", while applying a condition with an "and" clause in the "where" section. The query limits the result to a single record. The [database-type] slot specifies the database type, and [limit] restricts the number of records returned.
