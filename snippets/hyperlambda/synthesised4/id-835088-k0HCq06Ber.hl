// The code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a database table named "crypto_keys" using the [data.read] slot. It applies a [where] clause to filter records where the "fingerprint" column matches the value obtained from the [crypto.fingerprint] node. The [and] slot is used to combine conditions, allowing for additional criteria if needed.
data.read
   table:crypto_keys
   where
      and
         fingerprint.eq:x:@crypto.fingerprint
