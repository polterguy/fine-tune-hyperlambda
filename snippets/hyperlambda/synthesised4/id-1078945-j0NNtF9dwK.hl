/*
 * This expression is a lambda expression in Hyperlambda, and it consists of a single iterator. Below is a detailed explanation of the iterator used in this expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@lambda2hyper`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "lambda2hyper" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that the search is for a node by name, starting from the current node and traversing upwards and sideways in the hierarchy until it finds a match. This is useful when you want to retrieve a specific node by name, regardless of its position in the hierarchy relative to the current node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to locate and retrieve a node named "lambda2hyper" within a larger Hyperlambda structure, which might be necessary if you need to access or manipulate data or logic encapsulated within that node.
 * - It can be used in scenarios where you need to ensure that a specific named node is present in the hierarchy, possibly to validate configurations or dependencies before executing further logic.
