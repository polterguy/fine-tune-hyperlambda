// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node. The expression [set-value:x:@.dp/#] targets the value of the node currently referenced by [.dp], which is typically used within a loop or iteration context, and assigns it the static string "Loop was here ...".
set-value:x:@.dp/#
   .:Loop was here ...
