// The code demonstrates how to use the [sort] slot in Hyperlambda to sort a list of nodes based on a specified condition. It sorts nodes by comparing the [name] values of each node, using [lt], [mt], and [else] slots to determine the order. The sorted result is returned as a new list, leaving the original list unchanged. The main slots used are: [sort] for sorting nodes, [if] for conditional logic, [lt] and [mt] for comparison, and [set-value] to assign the sorting result.
