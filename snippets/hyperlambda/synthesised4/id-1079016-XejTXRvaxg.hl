 * 1. `@.no-invocation`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no-invocation" in the current context. It starts from the current node and traverses upwards through its ancestors and siblings to find a match. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to check if a specific node named "no-invocation" exists in the current context, which might be useful for conditional logic or validation purposes.
 * - It can be used to retrieve configuration or metadata stored in a node named "no-invocation" that is relevant to the current operation or context.
