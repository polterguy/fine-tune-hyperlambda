// The code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between the "Medications" and "Patients" tables in a SQLite database using the [data.read] slot. It specifies the join condition based on the "PatientID" field and aliases the join as "PatientID". It also includes an aggregate function in the columns section, which is aliased as "result", and applies a limit of 1 to the query results. The [where] clause is present but not defined with conditions.
