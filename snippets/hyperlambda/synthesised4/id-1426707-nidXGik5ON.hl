// This Hyperlambda code snippet dynamically adds nodes to a destination node. It uses the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] from the [.arguments] node's children, specifically those named [type]. The [add] slot's expression points to the next elder sibling node of the current context, effectively adding the retrieved nodes to it. The [get-nodes] slot fetches nodes based on the specified expression, allowing for flexible and dynamic node manipulation within the Hyperlambda graph.
