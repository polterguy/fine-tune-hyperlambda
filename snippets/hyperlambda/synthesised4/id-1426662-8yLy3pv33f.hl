/*
 * This Hyperlambda code changes the name of all nodes that are two levels below the current node to the value of the first node resulting from splitting a string. The [set-name] slot is used to modify the names of the nodes, and the [get-value] slot retrieves the value from a previously executed [strings.split] operation. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the name of nodes referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node its expression is pointing to.
