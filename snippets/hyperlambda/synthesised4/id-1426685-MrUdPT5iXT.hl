/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.filename] node to the result obtained from the [strings.replace] operation. The [strings.replace] operation is expected to have been executed previously, and its result is retrieved using [get-value]. The [set-value] slot is used to update the [.filename] node with this retrieved value. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.filename] node.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the result from the [strings.replace] operation.
 * 3. [strings.replace] - The operation whose result is being retrieved and set as the value of [.filename].
