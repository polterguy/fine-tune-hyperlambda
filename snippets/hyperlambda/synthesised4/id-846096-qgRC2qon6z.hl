/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda, which executes its child nodes if preceding conditions are false. Here, it sets the [.result] node's value by replacing occurrences of '[[copy_button]]' with 'false' in its current value. The [strings.replace] slot is used for string substitution within the [.result] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes its child nodes if no preceding conditions are true.
 * 2. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.result] node.
 * 3. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of '[[copy_button]]' with 'false' in the [.result] node's value.
