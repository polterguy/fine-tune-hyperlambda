// 1. `@.session`: This iterator searches for the first node named "session" within the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node itself. This is useful when you need to access session-related data or configurations that might be stored in a node named "session" within the current execution context. A potential use case could be retrieving user session information or settings stored in a "session" node.
