// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes into a destination node's children collection. It uses [get-nodes] to retrieve nodes referenced by [.dp] and adds them to all [return] nodes found in the parent node's children collection. This allows for flexible and dynamic modification of the node structure during execution.
