/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type of a node's value. It starts by declaring a node [.foo] with an integer value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to obtain the type of the value of the node above it, which is expected to return "int" as the type name. 
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type of the node's value above it, which is "int".
