// This Hyperlambda code checks if an HTTP GET request's status code is between 200 and 299 (inclusive), indicating a successful response. If true, it retrieves the first data element from the response content and assigns it to the [.cat-fact] node. The [if] slot evaluates the condition using [and], [mte], and [lt] slots to ensure the status code is within the desired range before executing the [.lambda] block.
