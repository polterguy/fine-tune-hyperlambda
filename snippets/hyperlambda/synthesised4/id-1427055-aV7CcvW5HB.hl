/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the "as" node within a specific path in the node structure to the value of the "aggregate_function" argument. It uses [set-value] to change the value of a node and [get-value] to retrieve the value of the "aggregate_function" argument. The expression in [set-value] navigates through the node hierarchy to locate the "as" node under "columns". 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of a node specified by its expression.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the "aggregate_function" argument.
