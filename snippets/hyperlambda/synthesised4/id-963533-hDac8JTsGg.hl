// The [data.delete] slot is used to delete records from a specified table in a database, with the ability to specify the database type and conditions for deletion. The [database-type] slot specifies the type of database, while the [table] slot indicates the table from which records will be deleted. The [where] slot allows for conditional deletion, using logical operators like [and] to combine multiple conditions.
