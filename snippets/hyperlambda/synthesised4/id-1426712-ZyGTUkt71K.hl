// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied with an expression pointing to the next sibling node using the "+" iterator. This means that before the instruction pointer reaches the node where [unwrap] is used, the expression will be evaluated, effectively "unwrapping" the value of the next sibling node. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions within a lambda object before execution.
