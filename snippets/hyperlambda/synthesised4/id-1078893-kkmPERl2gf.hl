/*
 * 1. `@.no-slots`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no-slots" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. 
 * 
 * Potential use case:
 * - This expression can be used to check if a specific configuration or setting node named "no-slots" exists in the current execution context or any of its parent nodes, which might be used to determine if certain features or slots should be disabled or bypassed during execution.
