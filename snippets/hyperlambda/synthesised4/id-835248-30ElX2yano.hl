// This Hyperlambda code uses the [add] slot to append nodes into a destination node collection. It targets the children of the [invoke] node as the destination, and adds nodes retrieved from two sources: the children of the [.arguments] node and the children of the [.model] node. The [get-nodes] slot is used to fetch these nodes, which are then added to the [invoke] node's children collection.
