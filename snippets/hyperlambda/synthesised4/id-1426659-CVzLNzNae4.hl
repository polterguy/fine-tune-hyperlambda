/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the node value referenced by [@.completion] contains a double space ("  "). If it does, the code replaces all occurrences of the double space with a single space (" "). The process involves using the [strings.contains] slot to verify the presence of the double space and then using [strings.replace] to perform the substitution. The result is that any double spaces in the original string are reduced to single spaces. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Begins a conditional check.
 * 2. [strings.contains] - Checks if the string at [@.completion] contains a double space.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Executes the following code block if the condition is true.
 * 4. [set-value] - Sets the value of [@.completion] to the result of the [strings.replace] operation.
 * 5. [strings.replace] - Replaces all occurrences of a double space with a single space in the string at [@.completion].
