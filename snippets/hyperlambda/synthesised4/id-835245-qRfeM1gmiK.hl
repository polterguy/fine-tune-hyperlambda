// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate a complex expression before the node it references is reached, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, it unwraps a deeply nested node structure, specifically targeting the 'content' node, and evaluates its value before reaching the node in the execution flow.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*/content
