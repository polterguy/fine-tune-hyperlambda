/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves to the next node in the sequence, which is the node directly below the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate the node immediately following the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. After moving to the elder sibling with the `+` iterator, the `*` iterator will access all the children of that elder sibling node. This is useful for operations that need to process or evaluate all child nodes of a particular node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the result set obtained from the previous `*` iterator. It further drills down into the hierarchy, accessing all descendants of the children nodes retrieved by the first `*` iterator. This is useful for deep traversal operations where you need to access multiple levels of child nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in scenarios where you need to perform operations on a deeply nested structure starting from the elder sibling of a given node. For example, if you have a configuration file or a data structure where settings or parameters are nested, this expression can help in accessing and modifying those nested parameters efficiently.
 * - It can also be used in data transformation tasks where hierarchical data needs to be flattened or processed at multiple levels starting from a specific point in the hierarchy.
