/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you need to access or manipulate a node's parent, often used in hierarchical data structures to traverse upwards.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is commonly used to access or iterate over all child nodes of a given parent node, allowing for operations on multiple nodes at once.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "data.read". It is useful when you want to specifically target nodes with this name, possibly to perform read operations or extract data from these nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to read data from all "data.read" nodes that are children of the parent node of the current context. This might be useful in data processing tasks where specific data nodes need to be accessed and read for further processing or analysis.
