/*
 * The [return-nodes] slot is used within dynamically created slots to return multiple nodes as a lambda object. In the provided example, a dynamic slot named "foo" is created, which returns two nodes: [integer-value] with an integer value of 57, and [string-value] with a string value "Foo bar". This slot is invoked using the [signal] slot, which executes the dynamic slot and returns the specified nodes. 
 * 
 * 1. [slots.create] - Creates a new dynamic slot named "foo".
 * 2. [return-nodes] - Returns multiple nodes as a lambda object from the dynamic slot.
 * 3. [integer-value] - A node with an integer value of 57 to be returned.
 * 4. [string-value] - A node with a string value "Foo bar" to be returned.
 * 5. [signal] - Invokes the dynamic slot "foo" to execute and return the nodes.
