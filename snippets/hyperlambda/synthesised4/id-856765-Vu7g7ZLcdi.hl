/*
 * The code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot to handle conditional logic based on different cases. It evaluates the value of a specified node and executes the corresponding [case] block if a match is found. If no match is found, the [default] block is executed. This allows for efficient branching based on multiple potential values. 
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Initiates a switch-case structure to evaluate different conditions.
 * 2. [eq] - Compares the value of a node to determine if it matches a specified case.
 * 3. [default] - Executes if no [case] condition is met, providing a fallback action.
