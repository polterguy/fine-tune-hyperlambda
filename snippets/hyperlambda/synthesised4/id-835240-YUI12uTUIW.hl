/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to append nodes to a destination node's children collection. It retrieves nodes specified by the [get-nodes] slot from the [.arguments] node, specifically targeting nodes with the name [type], and adds them to the current node's children collection. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the destination node's children collection.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes with the name [type] from the [.arguments] node.
