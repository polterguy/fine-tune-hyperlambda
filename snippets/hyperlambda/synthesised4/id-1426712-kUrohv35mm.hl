// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes to a destination node. In this example, it adds a node structure under the [.session] node. The added structure contains a [.role] node with the value "user" and a [.content] node whose value is dynamically set to the value of the [data] node within the [.arguments] node. This allows for the flexible addition of user-specific data to a session node, which can be useful in scenarios where user roles and content need to be dynamically managed within a session context.
add:x:@.session
   .
      .
         role:user
         content:x:@.arguments/*/data
