/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it is looking for a node with a specific name.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It allows you to access any node that is directly under the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `user_id` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "user_id" from the children of the "arguments" node. It ensures that only nodes with this specific name are returned.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to extract the "user_id" from a set of arguments passed to a function or endpoint. It is useful for validating or processing user-specific data within a Hyperlambda application.
