/*
 * 1. `@.token`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "token" that is located before the current node in its hierarchy. It searches through siblings and ancestors to find the first occurrence of a node named "token". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in scenarios where you need to access a specific configuration or authentication token that is defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure.
 * - It can be useful for retrieving a value that is set globally or higher up in the hierarchy, such as a session token or a user identifier, which is then used in subsequent operations or validations.
