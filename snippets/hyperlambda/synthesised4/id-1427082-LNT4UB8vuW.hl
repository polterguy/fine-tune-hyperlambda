// The [and] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate multiple boolean conditions, returning true only if all specified conditions are true. It short-circuits upon encountering a false condition, skipping the evaluation of subsequent conditions. This behavior allows it to be used in complex logical trees, ensuring efficient execution by halting further checks once a false condition is found.
