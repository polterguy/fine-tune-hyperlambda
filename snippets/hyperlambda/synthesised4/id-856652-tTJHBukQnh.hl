// The [case] slot is used within a [switch] block to define a specific condition to match against the evaluated value of the [switch]. When the value of the [switch] matches the value of a [case], the associated lambda object is executed. The [case] slot must have a value, which can be a constant or an expression, and is used to determine if the [case] should be executed.
