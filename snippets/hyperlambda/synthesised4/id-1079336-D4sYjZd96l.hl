/*
 * This expression is used to navigate a Hyperlambda node structure and retrieve specific nodes based on their hierarchy and naming. Let's break down each part of the expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@.words`: This iterator starts the navigation by looking for the first node named "words" that is an ancestor of the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node with the specified name, and the `.` indicates it starts from the current node's context.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the node found in the previous step. The `*` symbol is used to select all direct child nodes of the "words" node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * 
 * - This expression can be used in a scenario where you have a node named "words" and you want to perform operations on all of its children, such as iterating over them to modify their values or to apply some transformation.
 * - It could be useful in a text processing application where each child node of "words" represents a different word, and you need to analyze or manipulate each word individually.
