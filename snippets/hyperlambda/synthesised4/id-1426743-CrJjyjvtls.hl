/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a string contains only numeric characters and a dot. It uses [strings.replace-not-of] to replace all non-numeric characters and dots with an empty string, then compares the result with the original string using [eq]. If they are not equal, it sets a [found] node to true, indicating non-numeric characters were present. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Starts a conditional statement.
 * 2. [not] - Negates the condition that follows.
 * 3. [eq] - Compares two values for equality.
 * 4. [strings.replace-not-of] - Replaces characters not in the specified set with a given character.
 * 5. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a node.
 * 6. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 7. [set-value] - Sets the value of a node.
 * 8. [.found] - The node being set to true if the condition is met.
