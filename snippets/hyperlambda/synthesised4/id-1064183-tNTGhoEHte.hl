/*
 * 1. `@data.connect` - This iterator starts by selecting the first node with the name "data.connect". It is used to locate the starting point in the node hierarchy where the subsequent operations will be performed.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.connect" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the selected node.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to select only those with the name "data.read". It is used to narrow down the node set to those specifically involved in reading data.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.read" nodes. It is used to access all direct descendants of the selected "data.read" nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `columns` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to select only those with the name "columns". It is used to focus on nodes that represent columns in a data structure.
 * 
 * 6. `1` - This iterator selects the second child node (indexing starts at 0) of the "columns" node. It is used to access a specific column node by its position.
 * 
 * 7. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the selected column node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the specific column node.
 * 
 * 8. `as` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to select only those with the name "as". It is used to focus on nodes that may represent aliasing or naming conventions for the column data.
