/*
 * This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the first child node of the [src] node, which is a child of the node referenced by the [.dp] node's value. The expression uses a combination of iterators to navigate the node structure and access the desired node's value. 
 * 
 * 1. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 2. [x:"@.dp/#/*/\@src/[0,1]"] - The expression used to navigate the node structure:
 *    - `@.dp` - Finds the first node named [.dp].
 *    - `#` - Dereferences the value of the [.dp] node, assuming it's a node reference.
 *    - `*` - Retrieves all children of the dereferenced node.
 *    - `\@src` - Finds the first node named [src] among the children.
 *    - `[0,1]` - Retrieves the first child of the [src] node.
