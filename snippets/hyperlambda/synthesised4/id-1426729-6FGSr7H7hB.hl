/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds nodes from one location to another within a node structure. It uses the [add] slot to append nodes to the children of the [urls] node located under the [return] node. The source nodes are retrieved using the [get-nodes] slot, which points to the children of the [urls] node. This effectively duplicates the nodes from the original [urls] location to the target [urls] location under [return].
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the target node's children collection.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the specified source location.
