// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes to a specific destination node. The [add] slot targets the nodes located at the path "./*/return/*/snippets" and appends the nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot, which fetches all child nodes under the [snippets] node. This operation effectively copies all nodes from the source [snippets] node to the destination node specified in the [add] slot.
add:x:./*/return/*/snippets
   get-nodes:x:@.snippets/*
