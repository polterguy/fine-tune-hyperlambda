// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of nodes within a specific path in the node structure. It targets nodes under [data.connect], specifically within [data.read] and [group], and renames them to the value of [group_column] from [.arguments]. The [set-name] slot is used to perform the renaming, and [get-value] retrieves the new name from the specified argument.
set-name:x:@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/group_column
