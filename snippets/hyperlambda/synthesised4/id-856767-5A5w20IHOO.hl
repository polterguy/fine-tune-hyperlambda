// The [context] slot in Hyperlambda allows you to add an object to the stack, making it accessible throughout the execution of a Hyperlambda snippet. This is useful for sharing data across different parts of the code without passing it as arguments. The slot requires a name, a [value] node for the data, and a [.lambda] block where the context can be retrieved using [get-context]. This mechanism is particularly helpful for maintaining "long-lasting arguments" accessible from any invoked slot or executed Hyperlambda file.
