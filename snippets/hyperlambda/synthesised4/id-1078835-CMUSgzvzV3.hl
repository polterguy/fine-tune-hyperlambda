/*
 * This expression is used to navigate a node structure in Hyperlambda. Let's break it down:
 * 
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator starts the navigation by locating the first node named "result" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name.
 * 
 * 2. `/*`: The `*` symbol is used to retrieve all children of the node found in the previous step. In this case, it retrieves all children of the "result" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access all child nodes of a "result" node, which might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or evaluate multiple results or outcomes stored as children of a "result" node.
 * - It could be used in a loop or iteration to apply some operation or transformation to each child node under "result".
