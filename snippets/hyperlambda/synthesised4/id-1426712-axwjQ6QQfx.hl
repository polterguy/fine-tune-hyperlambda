 * // This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression and assigns it to the [get-value] slot. The expression "@.result" points to the [.result] node, and the [get-value] slot will return the value of this node. This is useful for accessing the value of a specific node within the current context of the Hyperlambda execution.
 * // 1. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * // 2. [@.result] - Expression pointing to the [.result] node whose value is to be retrieved.
