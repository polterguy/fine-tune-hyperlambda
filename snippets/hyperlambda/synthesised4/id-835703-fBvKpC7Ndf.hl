// The code defines a validator using [validators.enum] to ensure that the value of [distinct_column] in [.arguments] is one of the specified valid options. These options include column names from the "leads" table such as "lead_id", "client_id", "source", "status", "created_date", and a column from another table "client_id" with the name "name". This setup is crucial for validating input against a predefined set of acceptable values, ensuring data integrity and preventing errors.
