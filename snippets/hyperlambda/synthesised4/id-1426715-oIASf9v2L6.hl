 * This Hyperlambda code snippet retrieves the Hyperlambda type name of a node's value. It uses the [type] slot to determine the type of the value of the node it points to, which in this case is a decimal type. The [type] slot is useful for dynamically determining the data type of a node's value within a Hyperlambda script.
