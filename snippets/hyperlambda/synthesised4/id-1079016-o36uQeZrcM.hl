/*
 * 1. `@.hook-url`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "hook-url" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first such node it encounters. This is useful when you need to access a specific configuration or URL that is defined higher up in the node structure, such as a webhook URL that is used across different parts of the application. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a webhook URL that is defined at a higher level in the configuration for use in sending notifications or updates.
 * - Accessing a common configuration setting that is shared across multiple parts of a Hyperlambda script.
