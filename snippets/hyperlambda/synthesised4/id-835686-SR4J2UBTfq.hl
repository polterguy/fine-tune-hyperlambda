// This Hyperlambda code uses the [auth.ticket.verify] slot to ensure that the currently authenticated user has the "guest" role. If the user does not possess this role, the slot will throw an exception, effectively preventing unauthorized access to the resource or operation. This is typically used in securing HTTP endpoints to enforce role-based access control.
