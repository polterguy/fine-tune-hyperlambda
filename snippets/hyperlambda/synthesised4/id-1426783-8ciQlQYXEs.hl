// This Hyperlambda code checks if there are any child nodes under the [result] node of the [execute] node. If such nodes exist, it concatenates a string to the [.new-prompt] node, which includes a message about the response from a workflow, formatted as JSON. It also sets the [.function-result] node to the JSON representation of the lambda object. The code utilizes the [exists] slot to verify the presence of nodes, [set-value] to assign values to nodes, and [strings.concat] to build the string message.
