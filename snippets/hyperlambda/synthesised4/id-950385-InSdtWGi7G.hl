// This Hyperlambda code logs a message indicating that another number has been found, and it includes the number in the log entry. The [log.info] slot is used to create an informational log entry, while the [number] slot retrieves the value of the currently iterated node by reference using the [.dp] node, which is typically used within a [for-each] loop or similar iterative constructs.
log.info:We found another number!
   number:x:@.dp/#
