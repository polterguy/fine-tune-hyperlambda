/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the root node of arguments passed into a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "session" from the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically access the "session" argument if it exists.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to retrieve the "session" argument from the passed arguments. This is useful in scenarios where session information is required for processing, such as maintaining user state in a web application.
