/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet constructs a connection string by concatenating a generic connection string prefix with a database name extracted from the arguments, and assigns it to the [.connection] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.connection] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 3. [.:[generic|] - The first part of the connection string.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the database name from the arguments.
 * 5. [.:" ] - Closes the connection string with a bracket.
