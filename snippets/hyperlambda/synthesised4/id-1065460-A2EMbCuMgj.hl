// 1. `@.sql` - This iterator looks for the first node named "sql" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards through its ancestors and siblings until it finds a node with the name "sql". This is useful when you need to reference a specific node named "sql" that might be located at a higher level in the hierarchy or among sibling nodes.
