 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves one step down in the hierarchy to the next node. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate the node immediately following the current node in a sequence.
 * 
 * 2. `/**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the current node, including the node itself, using a "breadth-first" traversal algorithm. It is useful when you want to perform operations on all nodes within a subtree, regardless of their depth, starting from a specific node.
