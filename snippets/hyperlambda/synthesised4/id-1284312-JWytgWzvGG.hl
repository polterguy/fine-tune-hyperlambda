// The expression `unwrap:x:+/*` is used to forward evaluate the children of the node immediately following the current node in the hierarchy. This is particularly useful when you want to ensure that all expressions within these children nodes are evaluated before the execution continues to the next node. By using this expression, you can dynamically manipulate or prepare data before it is used in subsequent operations. A potential use case for this expression is when you have a set of nodes that need to be processed or transformed before being passed to another function or slot, ensuring that all necessary computations or evaluations are completed in advance.
