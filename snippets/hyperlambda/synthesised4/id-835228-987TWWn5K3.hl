// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and retrieve all descendant nodes of the [.sse] node within the current context, specifically targeting the [.session] nodes. This allows you to forward evaluate these nodes before reaching the point in the Hyperlambda where they are referenced, effectively preparing their values for subsequent operations.
