// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specific string within another string. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the string to be replaced, and the second is the replacement string. In this example, the code replaces occurrences of the string "rtl" with "false" in the node referenced by the expression [@.result]. The [strings.replace] slot evaluates its arguments and performs the replacement operation on the specified target string.
strings.replace:x:@.result
   .:[[rtl]]
   .:false
