 * // This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.no-invocation] is not equal to the integer 0. If the value is not equal to 0, the [neq] slot will evaluate to true. 
 * // 1. [neq] - Evaluates whether the value of the node pointed to by its expression is not equal to the provided integer value.
 * // 2. [@.no-invocation] - Expression pointing to the node whose value is being compared.
 * // 3. [.:int:0] - The integer value 0, which is the comparison target for the [neq] slot.
