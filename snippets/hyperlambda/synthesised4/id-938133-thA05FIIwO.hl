// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda, which executes its child nodes when previous [if] or [else-if] conditions evaluate to false. In this example, if none of the preceding conditions are true, the [else] block executes a [yield] slot, setting the value of [allowed] to false, indicating a default action or state.
