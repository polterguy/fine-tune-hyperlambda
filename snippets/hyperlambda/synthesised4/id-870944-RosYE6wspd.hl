// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a destination node. The [add] slot takes an expression leading to multiple destinations as its main argument, allowing you to add a copy of your source nodes into multiple destination node collections simultaneously. In this example, it appends nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] from the [.arguments] node to the destination node specified by the expression in [add]. The [get-nodes] slot is used to retrieve all child nodes of [.arguments].
