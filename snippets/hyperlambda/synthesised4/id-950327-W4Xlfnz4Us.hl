// The Hyperlambda code checks a condition using [if] and moves a file from "/uploads/image.jpg" to "/gallery/image.jpg" using [io.file.move] if the condition is true. The [if] slot evaluates the condition specified in its expression, and if true, executes its children nodes. The [io.file.move] slot deletes the source file after moving it to the destination.
