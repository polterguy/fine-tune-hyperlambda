/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [arguments] from the current context. It is used to access the arguments passed to a function, slot, or endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously retrieved [arguments] node. It is used to access all arguments passed in, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `url` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "url" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically access the argument named "url".
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or endpoint to retrieve the value of a URL passed as an argument. It is particularly useful in scenarios where a slot or endpoint needs to process or validate a URL provided by the user or another system.
