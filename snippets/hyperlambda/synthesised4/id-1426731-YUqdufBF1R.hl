/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add a node to a collection using the [add] slot. It targets the [.arguments] node and appends a new node named [headers] to it. The [headers] node is added as a child of the [.arguments] node, which can be useful for including additional data or configuration settings in a structured manner. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - This slot is used to append a new node to the specified node collection.
 * 2. [.] - This node acts as a container for the child nodes that will be added.
 * 3. [headers] - This node is added as a child to the [.arguments] node, potentially to store HTTP headers or similar data.
