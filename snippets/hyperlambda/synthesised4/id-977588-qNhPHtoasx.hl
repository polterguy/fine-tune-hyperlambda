// This Hyperlambda snippet connects to a database and executes a SQL SELECT query to retrieve the "first_name" and "last_name" from the "actor" table where the "last_name" matches a pattern specified by the "@filter" parameter. The filter is dynamically constructed using the [strings.concat] slot, allowing for flexible query conditions.
data.select:SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor WHERE last_name LIKE @filter
   @filter:x:@strings.concat
