// This Hyperlambda code snippet verifies a password by comparing it against a stored hash. The [crypto.password.verify] slot takes the password from the [.arguments] node and the hash from the [data.read] node, ensuring the password matches the stored hash for authentication.
crypto.password.verify:x:@.arguments/*/password
   hash:x:@data.read/*/*/password_hash
