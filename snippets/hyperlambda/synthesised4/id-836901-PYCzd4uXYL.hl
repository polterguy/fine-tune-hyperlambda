// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL read operation with a left join between the "tasks" and "users" tables in an SQLite database. It specifies the use of a left join on the "user_id" field, with an alias for the "users" table, and selects distinct columns with an alias. The [where] clause is prepared for additional conditions. Key slots include [data.read] for initiating the read operation, [join] for specifying the join type and conditions, and [columns] for selecting specific columns.
