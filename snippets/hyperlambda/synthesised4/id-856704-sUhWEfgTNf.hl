// This Hyperlambda code uses the [or] slot to evaluate two conditions: it checks if the node specified by the expression does not exist using [not-exists], or if the value of the node is more than 0 using [mt]. If either condition is true, the [or] slot will evaluate to true. The code is useful for validating that a node is either absent or has a value greater than zero.
