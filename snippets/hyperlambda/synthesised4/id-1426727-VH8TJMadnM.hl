// This Hyperlambda code uses the [validators.default] slot to ensure that a node named [delay] exists within the node collection specified by the expression [@.arguments]. If the [delay] node does not exist, it appends it with a value derived from the expression [@signal/*/crawl-delay]. If the [delay] node exists but has a null value, it sets its value to the result of the expression.
