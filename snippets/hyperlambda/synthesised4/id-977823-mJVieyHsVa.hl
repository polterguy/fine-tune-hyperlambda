// This Hyperlambda code uses the [switch] slot to evaluate the value of the [feature-enabled] node. It has two [case] nodes: one for when [feature-enabled] is true, setting the [status] node to "Enabled", and another for when it is false, setting the [status] node to "Disabled". The [switch] slot allows conditional execution based on the value of [feature-enabled].
switch:x:@.feature-enabled
   case:bool:true
      set-value:x:@.status
         .:Enabled
   case:bool:false
      set-value:x:@.status
         .:Disabled
