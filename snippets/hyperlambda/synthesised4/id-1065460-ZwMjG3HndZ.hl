// 1. `@.fields`: This iterator searches for the first node named "fields" that is at the same level or higher in the hierarchy relative to the current node. The "@" symbol indicates that the search should start from the current node and look upwards through its ancestors and siblings. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that may not be a direct child of the current node, allowing you to reference nodes that are part of the broader structure of the Hyperlambda document.
