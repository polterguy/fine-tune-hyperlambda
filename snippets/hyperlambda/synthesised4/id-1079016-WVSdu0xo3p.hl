/*
 * 1. `@.prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "prompt" in the current context, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a specific configuration or setting node named "prompt" that is defined higher up in the hierarchy.
 * - Accessing a shared resource or variable named "prompt" that is used across multiple parts of a Hyperlambda script.
