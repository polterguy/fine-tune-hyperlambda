 * 1. `@.invoke`: This iterator looks for the first node named "invoke" in its current context. The `@` symbol signifies that it will search for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its siblings and ancestors until it finds a match. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve a node that is responsible for invoking a specific function or operation within a Hyperlambda graph. 
 * - It might be part of a larger expression to check if a particular invocation has been set or to modify its parameters dynamically.
