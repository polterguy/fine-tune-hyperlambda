// The Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [get-first-value] slot to retrieve the first non-null value from its children nodes or expressions. It first attempts to get the value from the [header] node within [.arguments] using [get-value], and if that returns null, it defaults to an empty value specified by the [.]. This approach is useful for ensuring a single non-null value is returned, often used for setting default values when arguments might be missing.
