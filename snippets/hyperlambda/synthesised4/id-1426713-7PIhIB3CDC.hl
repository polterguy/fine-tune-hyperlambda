// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a node with the name [finish_reason] to the node referenced by the expression [@.result]. The value of the [finish_reason] node is set to the first non-null value obtained from evaluating the expression [@get-first-value]. This is useful for assigning a default or fallback value to [finish_reason] when multiple potential sources are available, ensuring only a single value is used.
