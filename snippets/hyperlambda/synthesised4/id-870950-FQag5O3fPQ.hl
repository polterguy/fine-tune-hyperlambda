// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. It allows for forward evaluation of expressions, ensuring that the values are computed before the execution of the lambda object. This slot is particularly useful when invoking lambda objects with expressions, as it transforms expressions into their static values before execution.
