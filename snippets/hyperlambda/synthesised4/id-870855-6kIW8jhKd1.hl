// The code uses [set-value] to change the value of the [.body] node by replacing parts of its content. It utilizes [strings.replace] to substitute occurrences in [.body] with a new string created by [strings.concat], which combines the name of the current node (retrieved by [get-name]) with its value (retrieved by [get-value]).
