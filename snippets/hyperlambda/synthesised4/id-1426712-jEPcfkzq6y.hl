// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of [.iterations] is less than or equal to 1. If true, it logs an error message indicating "Too many function invocations" and sends multiple socket signals to a session. Each signal contains different arguments, such as function error details, function waiting status, error status, and a finished status, all indicating an error due to excessive function invocations. The signals are intended to inform the session of the error and its details, and to indicate that the function processing has finished due to this error.
