// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database, specifically from the "campaigns" table. It selects a distinct column named "distinct_functor" and aliases it with a dot (.), indicating no aliasing. The [where] clause is prepared for conditions, but no specific conditions are provided, implying a placeholder for future filtering criteria. The [database-type] slot specifies the type of database being queried, ensuring compatibility with SQLite syntax and operations.
