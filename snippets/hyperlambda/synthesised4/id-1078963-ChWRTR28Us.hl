/*
 * 1. `@.disallow`: This iterator searches for the first node named "disallow" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to check if there is a "disallow" node present in the hierarchy, which might be used to determine if certain actions or operations are prohibited in the current context.
 * - It could be part of an access control mechanism where the presence of a "disallow" node indicates restricted access to certain features or data.
