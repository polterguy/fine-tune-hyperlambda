/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing the root arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which typically contains input parameters or configuration data for the current execution context.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any parameter nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node, allowing for iteration or further filtering.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "session" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically target a node named "session" within the arguments, which might contain session-specific data or identifiers.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve session-related data or identifiers passed as arguments to a Hyperlambda function or endpoint, allowing the function to perform operations based on the current session context.
