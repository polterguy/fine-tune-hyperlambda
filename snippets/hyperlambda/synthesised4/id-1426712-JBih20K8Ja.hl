/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [math.decrement] slot to decrease the value of the [.tmp] node by 1. The [math.decrement] slot modifies the value in place, meaning it directly changes the value of the node it references. The default decrement step is 1 if no additional argument is provided. 
 * 
 * 1. [math.decrement] - Decreases the value of the node specified in its expression by 1.
 * 2. [@.tmp] - References the node whose value is to be decremented.
