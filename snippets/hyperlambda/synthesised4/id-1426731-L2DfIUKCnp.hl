// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied to the node immediately following it, indicated by the "+" expression, which refers to the next sibling node. This means that the expression in the sibling node will be evaluated and its value will be set before the execution pointer reaches that node. This is useful for pre-evaluating expressions and ensuring that the node has the desired value when it's accessed.
