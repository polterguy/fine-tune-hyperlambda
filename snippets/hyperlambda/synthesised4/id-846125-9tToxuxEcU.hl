// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [lt] slot to compare the result of an [http.post] request with the integer 300. The [lt] slot checks if the status code returned from the HTTP POST request is less than 300, which typically indicates a successful HTTP response. If the condition is true, the [lt] slot will return true. The [http.post] slot is used to send a POST request to a specified URL, and its result, including the status code, is evaluated by the [lt] slot.
