// The [strings.mixin] slot executes inline Hyperlambda code within a string, allowing dynamic content insertion. It evaluates the Hyperlambda code found at the specified path and integrates the result into the surrounding string. In this example, it processes the Hyperlambda located at [.model/*/system_message] and includes its output into the string.
strings.mixin:x:@.model/*/system_message
