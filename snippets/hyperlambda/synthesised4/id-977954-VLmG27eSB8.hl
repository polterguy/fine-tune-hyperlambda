// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot to a specified location. The [add] slot targets the [.shipment-records] node, and the [get-nodes] slot fetches nodes from the result of the [data.read] expression. This operation effectively appends the fetched nodes to the [.shipment-records] node.
