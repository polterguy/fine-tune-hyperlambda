/*
 * This code evaluates a condition using the [if] slot, which checks if two [not] conditions are true. Each [not] condition contains an [eq] slot that compares the value of a node pointed to by [get-value] against an empty value. If both conditions are true, the [add] slot appends a node with a name of "automatic" and a boolean value of true to the [tmp] node's children. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Evaluates a condition and executes its children if true.
 * 2. [and] - Ensures both child conditions must be true.
 * 3. [not] - Negates the result of its child condition.
 * 4. [eq] - Checks for equality between two values.
 * 5. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a specified node.
 * 6. [.lambda] - Contains the code executed if the [if] condition is true.
 * 7. [add] - Appends a new node to the specified node's children.
 * 8. [automatic:bool:true] - The node added if the condition is true, with a boolean value.
