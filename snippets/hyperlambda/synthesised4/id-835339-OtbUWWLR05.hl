// This Hyperlambda code performs an HTTP GET request to a URL specified in the [.arguments] node. The request has a timeout of 30 seconds and includes custom headers such as "User-Agent", "Accept", and "Accept-Encoding". The headers specify the client identity and the types of content it can process. The [http.get] slot is used to execute the request, and the headers are configured to influence the server's response.
