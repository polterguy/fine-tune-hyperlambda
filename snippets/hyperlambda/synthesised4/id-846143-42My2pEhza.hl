/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes to a destination node's children collection. It targets all [return] nodes under a [try] node, adding a [sitemap] node to each. This allows for flexible and dynamic modification of node structures within a Hyperlambda graph. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified destination node(s).
 * 2. [x:@try/*/return] - Expression targeting all [return] nodes under a [try] node.
 * 3. [.] - Represents the nodes to be added.
 * 4. [sitemap] - The node being added to the targeted [return] nodes.
