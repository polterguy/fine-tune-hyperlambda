// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the value of the [aggregate_function] node, located within the [.arguments] node, is one of the predefined legal values: "min", "max", "sum", "avg", or "count". If the value does not match any of these options, an exception will be thrown. This validation is useful for ensuring that only valid aggregate functions are used in a given context.
