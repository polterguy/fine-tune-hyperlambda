// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.embedding] node by concatenating strings. It first adds an opening bracket "[", then joins all embedding data from the HTTP POST response using a comma as a separator, and finally appends a closing bracket "]". The [set-value] slot changes the [.embedding] node's value to this concatenated string.
