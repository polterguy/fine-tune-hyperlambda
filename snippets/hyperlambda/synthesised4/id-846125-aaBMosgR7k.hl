// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a logical condition using the [and] slot to combine two checks: [not-null] and [neq]. The [not-null] slot verifies that the [.result] node has a non-null value, while the [neq] slot checks that the value of [.result] is not equal to an empty string. The [and] slot ensures both conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true.
