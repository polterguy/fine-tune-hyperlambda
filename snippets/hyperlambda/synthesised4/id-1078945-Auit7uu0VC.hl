/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda HTTP endpoint or a dynamically executed slot, where input parameters are provided.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each individual argument passed to the endpoint or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `stream` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "stream" from the children of [.arguments]. It is used to specifically access the "stream" argument, which might be used to handle streaming data or a stream identifier in the context of the endpoint or slot.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a stream identifier or stream-related data passed as an argument to an HTTP endpoint or a dynamic slot in Hyperlambda.
 * - Handling streaming data in a web application, where the "stream" argument specifies the data stream to be processed.
