// The [set-value] slot in Hyperlambda is used to change the value of a node specified by its expression. In this example, it targets the [.url] node and sets its value to whatever is provided as a child node. The expression [x:@.url] points to the [.url] node, and the slot will update its value accordingly.
set-value:x:@.url
