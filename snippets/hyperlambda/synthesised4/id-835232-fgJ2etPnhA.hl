/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [insert-before] slot to insert nodes before a specified node in the hierarchy. It targets the first child of a [fork] node and inserts nodes obtained from [get-nodes] referencing [.arguments]. The [insert-before] slot ensures that the nodes from [.arguments] are placed before the first child node of [fork]. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves nodes specified by its expression, facilitating the insertion process.
 * 
 * 1. [insert-before] - Inserts nodes before the node(s) specified in its expression.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes based on the expression provided, used here to obtain nodes from [.arguments].
