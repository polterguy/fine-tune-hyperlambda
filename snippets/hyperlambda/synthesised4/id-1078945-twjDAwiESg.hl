/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `/message` - This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes with the name "message". It is used to specifically access the "message" argument from the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a function or slot to extract the value of a specific argument named "message" from the list of arguments passed to it.
 * - It can be used in logging or debugging scenarios where the "message" argument needs to be accessed and processed separately.
