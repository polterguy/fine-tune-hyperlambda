/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you need to navigate upwards in the node hierarchy to access parent nodes or their siblings.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is commonly used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing you to perform operations on each child node.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "data.read" from the previous result set. It is used to filter nodes by their name, focusing on those that match the specified name.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used here to access all nodes under the "data.read" node, allowing further navigation or operations on these nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `columns` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "columns" from the previous result set. It is used to filter and focus on nodes specifically named "columns" within the context of the "data.read" node's children.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used here to access all nodes under the "columns" node, allowing further navigation or operations on these nodes.
 * 
 * 7. `aggregate_functor` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "aggregate_functor" from the previous result set. It is used to filter and focus on nodes specifically named "aggregate_functor" within the context of the "columns" node's children.
