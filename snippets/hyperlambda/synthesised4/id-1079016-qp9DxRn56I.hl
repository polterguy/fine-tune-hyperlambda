/*
 * 1. `@execute` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "execute" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by its name, starting from the current node and searching through its siblings and their descendants.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "execute" node. It is used to access the entire set of child nodes under the "execute" node, allowing for further filtering or processing of these nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `workflow` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "workflow". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes specifically named "workflow" from the children of the "execute" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access and manipulate all "workflow" nodes that are children of an "execute" node. For example, it could be part of a process to dynamically configure or execute workflows within a larger automation or orchestration system.
 * - Another use case might be to validate or log information about workflows that are part of an execution process, ensuring that specific workflows are present or meet certain criteria.
