// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied with an expression pointing to its next sibling node using the "+" iterator. This means the value of the next sibling node will be evaluated and replaced with its evaluated result before the sibling node itself is processed. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions inside a lambda object before execution. The [unwrap] slot can also handle multiple nodes when the [apply-lists] argument is set to true.
