// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a "users" table in a database, filtering the results based on a specific condition. It uses the [data.read] slot to specify the table from which to retrieve data, and the [where] clause to apply a condition that checks if the "username" field equals a given value. The value for comparison is dynamically retrieved from the [.arguments] node, allowing for flexible input handling.
data.read
   table:users
   where
      and
         username.eq:x:@.arguments/*/username
