// The code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. It executes a block of code only if none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are met. In this example, the [else] block sets the value of [.tmp-completion] to the value obtained from [.result], ensuring a default action is taken when all other conditions fail.
else
   set-value:x:@.tmp-completion
      get-value:x:@.result
