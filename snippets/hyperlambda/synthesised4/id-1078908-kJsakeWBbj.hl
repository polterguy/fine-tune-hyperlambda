/*
 * 1. `@.auto_destruct`: This iterator looks for the first node in the current context that has the name "auto_destruct". The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` before "auto_destruct" specifies that it should start the search from the current node's level in the hierarchy. This expression is useful when you need to quickly access a specific node named "auto_destruct" within the same level of the current node, possibly to check its value or perform operations based on its presence or state.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a configuration or a setting node named "auto_destruct" that determines whether certain resources or data should be automatically deleted or cleaned up. By accessing this node, you can make decisions in your Hyperlambda code about whether to proceed with the auto-destruction process.
