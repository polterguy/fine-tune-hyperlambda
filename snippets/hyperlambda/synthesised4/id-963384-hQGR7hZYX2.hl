// This Hyperlambda code connects to the "inventory" MySQL database and deletes records from the "products" table where the "stock" field is equal to 0 and the "discontinued" field is true. The [mysql.connect] slot establishes the database connection, while the [mysql.delete] slot specifies the table and conditions for deletion using the [where] clause with logical conditions.
mysql.connect:inventory

            stock.eq:int:0
