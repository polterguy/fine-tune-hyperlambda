// This Hyperlambda snippet sets the value of [.crawl-delay] by multiplying 1000 with the integer conversion of the value found at [.value]. The [set-value] slot changes the target node's value, while [math.multiply] performs the multiplication, and [convert] ensures the value is treated as an integer.
