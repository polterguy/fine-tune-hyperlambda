// The expression `unwrap:x:+/*` is used to evaluate a node's children and forward the evaluation results to the next node in the sequence. The `+` iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node, and `/*` retrieves all children of that node. This expression is useful when you want to evaluate all children of the next sibling node in a sequence, allowing you to manipulate or inspect these nodes before proceeding with further operations. It effectively "unwraps" the children nodes, making their values or structure available for subsequent processing.
