// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node referenced by the expression [@.base]. It utilizes the [strings.trim-end] slot to trim the trailing slash from the value obtained from the [html2lambda] conversion, specifically targeting the [href] attribute of the [base] element within the [head] section of an HTML document. The [strings.trim-end] slot ensures that the resulting value does not end with a slash, and this value is then set to the [base] node.
set-value:x:@.base
   strings.trim-end:x:"@html2lambda/*/head/*/base/*/\\@href/[0,1]"
