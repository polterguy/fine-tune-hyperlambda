/*
 * 1. `@.filepath`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "filepath" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name, and the `.` signifies that it starts the search from the current node's context. This is useful for accessing configuration or path information stored in a node named "filepath" that is relevant to the current operation or context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a file path stored in a node to read or write a file.
 * - Retrieving a configuration setting that specifies the location of a resource needed by the current process.
