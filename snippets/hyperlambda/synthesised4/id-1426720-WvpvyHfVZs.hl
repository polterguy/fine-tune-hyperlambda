/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type of a node's value. In the example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to obtain the type of the value of the node above it, which is [.foo]. The result of the [type] slot will be "int", indicating that the value of [.foo] is of integer type.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type of the value of the node above it, which is [.foo].
