/*
 * 1. `@.exe` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "exe" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It is useful for accessing a specific node that is an ancestor or sibling of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "exe" node. It is used to access all nodes directly under the "exe" node.
 * 
 * 3. `join` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "join" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is useful for narrowing down the node set to specific nodes of interest.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "join" node. It allows access to all nodes directly under the "join" node.
 * 
 * 5. `fork` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "fork" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is useful for accessing specific nodes under the "join" node that are named "fork".
