// The [unwrap] slot in this example is used to evaluate the expression before reaching the node where it's referenced. It takes an expression as its value, and in this case, the expression is "+", which refers to the elder sibling of the current node. The [unwrap] slot ensures that the value of the node it is applied to is evaluated before the node itself is executed, allowing for dynamic evaluation of expressions within the Hyperlambda code. This is particularly useful when you want to forward evaluate expressions inside your lambda object before the lambda object is actually executed. The [unwrap] slot can also handle lists if the [apply-lists] argument is provided as true, allowing multiple nodes to be added as destination nodes into the unwrapped node.
