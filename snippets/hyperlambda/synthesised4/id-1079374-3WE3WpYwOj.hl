/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator searches for the first node named "sql" that is located at the same level as the current node or higher up in the hierarchy. It begins its search from the current node and moves upwards through its ancestors until it finds a node with the specified name. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve SQL query nodes or configurations that are defined at a higher level in the Hyperlambda structure, allowing for modular and reusable SQL query definitions.
 * - It can be employed in scenarios where SQL commands or settings need to be dynamically accessed and executed within a larger Hyperlambda application, ensuring that the correct SQL node is utilized regardless of the current node's position in the hierarchy.
