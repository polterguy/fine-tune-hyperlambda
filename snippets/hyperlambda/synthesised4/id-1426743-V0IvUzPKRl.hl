// This Hyperlambda code uses the [validators.mandatory] slot to ensure that the specified node path exists within the current context. If the node path [@.arguments/*/file/*/stream] does not exist, an exception will be thrown, indicating that the required argument is missing. This is useful for enforcing the presence of necessary data in a structured format before proceeding with further operations.
