// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to select records from an "employees" table where the department is either "Sales" or "Marketing". It uses the [data.read] slot to query the database, specifying the table name with [table], and applying a [where] condition with an [or] logical operator to filter records based on the department field.
data.read
   table:employees
   where
      or
         department.eq:Sales
         department.eq:Marketing
