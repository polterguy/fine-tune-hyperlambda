/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current context. It is used to navigate one level up in the hierarchy from the current node. In this context, it is used to move from the current node to its parent node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the node it is applied to. In this expression, it is used to access all children of the parent node retrieved by the previous iterator.
 * 
 * 3. `tasks.create` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "tasks.create". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes that match this specific name among the children retrieved by the previous `*` iterator.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current "tasks.create" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "tasks.create" node.
 * 
 * 5. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current context again, now within the context of the children of the "tasks.create" node. It is used to further drill down into the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 6. `.task-id` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name ".task-id". It is used to select nodes that have this specific name among the descendants retrieved by the previous `*` iterator.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve all ".task-id" nodes that are nested within a "tasks.create" node structure. It might be useful in scenarios where you need to collect or process task identifiers from a complex data structure, such as generating a list of task IDs for reporting or further processing.
