// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied with the expression "x:+/*/*". This expression will evaluate the current node's elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda), then retrieve all its children, and finally retrieve all children of those children. The result of this evaluation will be assigned to the current node's value. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions inside your lambda object before the lambda object is actually executed.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
