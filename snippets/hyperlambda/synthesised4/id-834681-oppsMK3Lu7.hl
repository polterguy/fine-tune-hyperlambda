// This Hyperlambda code iterates over files in a directory recursively, checking if each file ends with ".hl". If it does, the file is loaded, parsed into a lambda structure preserving comments, and any "database-type" nodes are removed. The modified structure is then converted back to Hyperlambda text, preserving comments, and saved back to the original file path. The slots used include [for-each] for iteration, [if] for conditional checking, [strings.ends-with] for string comparison, [io.file.load] and [io.file.save] for file operations, and [hyper2lambda] and [lambda2hyper] for parsing and serializing Hyperlambda.
