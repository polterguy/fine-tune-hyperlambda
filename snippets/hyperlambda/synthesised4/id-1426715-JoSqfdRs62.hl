/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to add a new node with a specific value to an existing node set. In this case, it adds a [model_size] node with an integer value of 4096 to the [model] node set. The [add] slot is used to modify the structure of the node graph by appending new nodes as specified. 
 * 
 * 1. [case] - The root node, typically used to define a case or scenario.
 * 2. [add] - A slot that adds a new node to the specified node set.
 * 3. [model] - The target node set where the new node will be added.
 * 4. [model_size] - The new node being added, with an integer value of 4096.
