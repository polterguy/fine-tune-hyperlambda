// The code uses [get-nodes] to retrieve nodes from the current context. It specifically targets nodes within [.arguments] that have a child node named [ml_training_snippets] and further filters these nodes by the [id] attribute, which is compared using the [mt] (more than) condition. This allows for dynamic selection of nodes based on specific criteria, facilitating flexible data manipulation and retrieval in Hyperlambda.
