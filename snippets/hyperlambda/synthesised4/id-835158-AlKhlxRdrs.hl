// This Hyperlambda code deletes records from the "questions" table where the "questionnaire" field matches the value of the "name" argument provided in the [.arguments] node. The [data.delete] slot is used to perform the deletion, and the [where] clause specifies the condition for selecting the records to delete. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple conditions, though in this case, only one condition is specified.
