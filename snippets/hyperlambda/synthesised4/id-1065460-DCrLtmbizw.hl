/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (the next node or the node below it) of the previous result set. It is used to navigate to the next node in the hierarchy, which can be useful when you want to process or evaluate nodes sequentially.
 * 
 * 2. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access the direct children of a node, allowing you to perform operations or evaluations on each child node.
 * 
 * 3. `/*` - This iterator, used again, retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it is used to access the grandchildren of the original node, allowing for operations or evaluations on deeper levels of the node hierarchy. 
 * 
 * This expression is useful for iterating over a set of nodes and their children, potentially to apply some transformation or evaluation on each node at a specific level in the hierarchy.
