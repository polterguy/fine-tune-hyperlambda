/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you need to access or manipulate the parent node of the current context.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access all direct children of a node.
 * 3. `return` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes named "return". It is useful for finding specific nodes by name within a set of nodes.
 * 4. `**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the previous result set, including the node itself, using a breadth-first search algorithm. It is useful for accessing all nodes within a subtree, regardless of depth.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to find all descendant nodes of a specific "return" node within the children of the parent node. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze all return-related data or nodes within a specific context or scope.
