// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [lambda2hyper] slot to transform a lambda hierarchy into a Hyperlambda text representation. The expression [x:@.session/*] specifies that the transformation should be applied to all child nodes of the [.session] node. This allows for the serialization of the session's lambda structure into a Hyperlambda string, which can be used for persistence or transmission purposes.
