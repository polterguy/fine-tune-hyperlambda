// This Hyperlambda expression retrieves the value of the [name] node, which is a child of the node referenced by [.dp]. The [.dp] node is typically used in loops or iterations to represent the current node being processed. The expression first accesses the node referenced by [.dp], then navigates to its child node named [name], and finally retrieves its value.
