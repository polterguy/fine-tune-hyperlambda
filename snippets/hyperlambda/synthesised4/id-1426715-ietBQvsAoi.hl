/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [case] slot within a [switch] statement to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a specified node. The [switch] slot evaluates the value of its expression, and the [case] slots define the possible values that trigger their respective code blocks. If none of the [case] slots match, the [default] slot is executed. This structure is useful for branching logic based on discrete values, similar to switch-case statements in other programming languages.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Evaluates the value of its expression to determine which [case] block to execute.
 * 2. [case] - Defines a possible value for the [switch] statement to match, executing its children if it matches.
 * 3. [default] - Executes its children if none of the [case] slots match the [switch] expression's value.
