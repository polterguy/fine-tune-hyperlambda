/*
 * 1. `@signal`: This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with this name. This is useful for locating a specific node in a potentially complex structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. It allows you to access every direct child node under "signal", regardless of their names. This is useful when you want to perform operations on all children of a node.
 * 
 * 3. `urls`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to only those named "urls". It helps in narrowing down the node set to only those nodes that are relevant to the operation you want to perform, specifically those named "urls".
 * 
 * 4. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of each "urls" node found in the previous step. This allows you to access every direct child node under each "urls" node, which could be useful for processing or extracting data from these nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to gather all URL-related information from a "signal" node. For example, in a web scraping or data aggregation task, you might use this expression to collect all URLs associated with a particular signal or event.
