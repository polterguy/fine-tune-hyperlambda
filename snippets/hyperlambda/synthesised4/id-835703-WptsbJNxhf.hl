// This Hyperlambda snippet uses the [set-name] slot to change the name of nodes referenced by its expression, specifically targeting nodes under [data.read] with a path to [distinct_functor]. The new name is constructed using [strings.concat], which concatenates the string "count(distinct ", the value of [distinct_column] from [.arguments], and the closing parenthesis ")". This effectively creates a SQL-like distinct count function name for the targeted nodes.
