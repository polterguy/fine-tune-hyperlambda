// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [and] slot to combine two conditions: [mte] and [lt]. The [mte] slot checks if the HTTP POST response code is "more than or equal" to 200, while the [lt] slot checks if the same response code is "less than" 300. Together, these conditions verify if the response code indicates a successful HTTP request, typically within the range of 200 to 299.
