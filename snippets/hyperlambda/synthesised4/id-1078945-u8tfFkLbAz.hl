/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator looks for the first node named "result" in the current context. The `@` symbol is used to find a node by its name, and the `.` indicates that it should start from the current node's context. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate the value of a node named "result" within the current scope. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing the result of a computation or operation that was previously stored in a node named "result".
 * - Checking the outcome of a function or process that updates the "result" node.
