/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator looks for the first node named "sql" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate a specific node named "sql" that might contain SQL query strings or database-related information. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a SQL query string stored in a node named "sql" for execution or modification.
 * - Accessing database connection details or configurations stored under a "sql" node in a Hyperlambda script.
