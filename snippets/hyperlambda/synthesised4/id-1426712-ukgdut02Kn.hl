// This Hyperlambda code snippet is returning a result from a previously executed signal, specifically extracting the "cached" node's value from the signal's result. It also specifies additional metadata about the return operation, indicating that the finish reason is "cached" and that streaming is set to false. This setup is useful for managing responses in a system where caching and streaming are considerations. The code is structured as follows: [result] retrieves the cached value from the signal's output, [finish_reason] provides context for the operation's completion, and [stream] indicates whether the response should be streamed.
return
   result:x:@signal/*/cached
   finish_reason:cached
   stream:bool:false
