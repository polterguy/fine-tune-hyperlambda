/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [html2lambda] slot to convert an HTML string into a lambda object. The HTML string is defined in the [.html] node, and the [html2lambda] slot processes this string to create a structured lambda representation of the HTML content. The resulting lambda object includes nodes representing HTML elements, attributes, and text content, allowing for programmatic manipulation of the HTML structure within Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 1. [.html] - Contains the HTML string to be converted into a lambda object.
 * 2. [html2lambda] - Converts the HTML string into a lambda object, creating nodes for elements, attributes, and text content.
