// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [data] exists within the [.arguments] node, ensuring it is not null and its value is not equal to an empty string. It uses [and] to combine these conditions, [exists] to verify the presence of the node, [not-null] to ensure it has a value, and [neq] to confirm the value is not an empty string.
