/*
 * The [context] slot in Hyperlambda is used to add an object onto the stack, which can later be retrieved using the [get-context] slot. This allows for storing and accessing data throughout the execution of a Hyperlambda snippet without passing it as an argument. In the example provided, the [context] slot is used to store a value "bar" under the name "foo", which is then retrieved using [get-context] and set as the value of [.result]. 
 * 
 * 1. [context] - Adds an object named "foo" with the value "bar" onto the stack.
 * 2. [.lambda] - Encapsulates the logic where the context object is accessible.
 * 3. [set-value] - Sets the value of [.result] to the retrieved context object.
 * 4. [get-context] - Retrieves the context object named "foo" from the stack.
