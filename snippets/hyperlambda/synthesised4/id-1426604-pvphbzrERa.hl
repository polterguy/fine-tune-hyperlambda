 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve nodes from a specified path in the node graph. 
 * // The [get-nodes] slot is used to access and return all nodes that match the expression provided in its value.
 * // In this example, the expression "@.buffer/*/*" is used to reference all child nodes of the nodes that are children of the [.buffer] node.
 * // The result of this operation will be a collection of nodes that are two levels deep under the [.buffer] node.
 * // 1. [get-nodes] - Retrieves and returns nodes that match the expression "@.buffer/*/*", accessing nodes two levels deep under [.buffer].
