// This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specified string within another string. The first argument, [[header]], is the string to be replaced, and the second argument is determined by the [get-first-value] slot. The [get-first-value] slot attempts to retrieve the value of the [header] node from the [.arguments] node, defaulting to an empty string if the [header] node is not present or has a null value. This allows for dynamic string replacement based on the presence of a [header] argument.
