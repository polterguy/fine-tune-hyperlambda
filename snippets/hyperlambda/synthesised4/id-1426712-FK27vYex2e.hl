// This Hyperlambda code snippet updates the value of all nodes within the current session that have a role of "system" to "developer". It uses the [set-value] slot to achieve this, where the expression `@.session/**/role/=system` filters and targets nodes with the specified role value, and the child node `.:developer` specifies the new value to be set.
set-value:x:@.session/**/role/=system
   .:developer
