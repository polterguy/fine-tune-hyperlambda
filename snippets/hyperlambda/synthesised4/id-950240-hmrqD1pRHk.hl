// The code sets the value of the [.result] node by replacing occurrences of a substring within it. It uses [strings.replace] to find and replace a substring specified by [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/what] with another substring specified by [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/with]. The [set-value] slot assigns the modified string back to [.result].
