// This Hyperlambda code checks if a specific node exists, is not null, and is not equal to an empty string. If all these conditions are true, it concatenates the value of this node with the current value of [.tmp], separated by two newline characters. The [if] slot is used to evaluate the conditions, and the [and] slot ensures all conditions must be true for the [.lambda] block to execute. The [set-value] and [strings.concat] slots are used to update the [.tmp] node.
