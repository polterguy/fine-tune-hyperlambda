// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the value of all [h4] nodes that are children of the [page-header] node to the value of the [prompt] node. The [set-value] slot is used to perform this operation, where the expression specifies the target nodes, and the [get-value] slot retrieves the new value to be set.
set-value:x:@.page-header/*/h4
