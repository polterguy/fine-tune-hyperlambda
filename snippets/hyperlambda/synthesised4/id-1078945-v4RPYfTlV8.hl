// 1. `@.outgoing`: This iterator searches for the first node named "outgoing" starting from the current node's context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, and the search is limited to the current node's siblings and its own hierarchy. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate data specifically stored in a node named "outgoing" within the current context, such as retrieving configuration settings or processing outgoing messages or data.
