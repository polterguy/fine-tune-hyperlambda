// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [fork] slot to execute a task asynchronously in a separate thread. Within this forked thread, it uses the [sleep] slot to pause execution for 1500 milliseconds before logging a message with [log.info]. This allows the main thread to continue running without waiting for the sleep duration to complete.
