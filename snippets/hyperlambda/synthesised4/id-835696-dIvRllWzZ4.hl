// This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL query on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "documents" table. It includes a left join with the "clients" table using the "client_id" as an alias. The query selects an aggregated column, renaming it as "result", and groups the results by a specified column. The [where] clause is prepared for additional conditions, though none are specified here.
