// The code connects to an MSSQL database and reads from the "employees" table. It selects the count of all records in this table, aliasing the result as "count", and limits the result to one record. The [database-type] specifies the type of database, [table] specifies the table name, [columns] defines the columns to select, and [limit] restricts the number of returned records.
