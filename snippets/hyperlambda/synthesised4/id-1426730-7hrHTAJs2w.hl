// The [unwrap] slot in this example evaluates expressions before the node it references is reached, effectively "unwrapping" the value of the node it points to. The expression "x:+/*/*" indicates that it will forward evaluate the expressions of all grandchildren nodes of the current node's elder sibling, allowing these values to be used or manipulated before the node itself is processed. This is useful for pre-evaluating expressions within a lambda object to ensure they are ready for use when needed.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
