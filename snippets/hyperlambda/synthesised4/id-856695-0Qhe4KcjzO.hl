/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to change the value of a node using the [set-value] slot. It concatenates a list of strings using [strings.concat], including a static string and the value of a node referenced by [get-value]. The result is assigned to the node specified by the [set-value] expression.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into a single string.
 * 3. [.] - Represents a static string value used in concatenation.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression.
