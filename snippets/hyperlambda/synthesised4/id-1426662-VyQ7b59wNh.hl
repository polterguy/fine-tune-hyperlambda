// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node it references is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied to the node immediately following it, indicated by the "+" expression. This means that the value of the node will be evaluated and replaced with the result of the expression before the Hyperlambda instruction pointer reaches it. The [unwrap] slot is useful for forward evaluating expressions within a lambda object, allowing dynamic evaluation of expressions before execution.
