// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database and inserts a new record into the "ml_training_snippets" table. It uses the [data.connect] slot to establish a connection, and the [data.create] slot to perform the insert operation. The record includes fields for [type], [prompt], [completion], and [uri], with values sourced from the current context or specified directly. The [type] field is dynamically set using an expression, while the [prompt], [completion], and [uri] fields are explicitly defined with static values.
