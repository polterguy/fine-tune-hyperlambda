/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a new node to a session node. It specifically adds a node with two children: a role node with the value "system" and a content node whose value is dynamically retrieved from a node named new-prompt. The [add] slot is used to insert this new structure as a child of the session node. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node structure to the session node.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the node being added.
 * 3. [.] - Child node of the node being added, containing role and content nodes.
 * 4. [role] - Node with a static value "system".
 * 5. [content] - Node with a value dynamically retrieved from the new-prompt node.
