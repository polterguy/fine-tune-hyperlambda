/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "new-prompt" that is located in the current node's hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might not be a direct child of the current node, but is somewhere in the hierarchy above or at the same level. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve configuration settings or parameters defined in a higher-level node named "new-prompt" that need to be accessed from a nested part of the Hyperlambda graph.
