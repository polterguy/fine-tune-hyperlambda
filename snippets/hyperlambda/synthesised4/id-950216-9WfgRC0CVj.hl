// This Hyperlambda code attempts to divide the integer 10 by 0 using the [math.divide] slot. Division by zero is undefined and will likely result in an error or exception when executed. The [math.divide] slot performs division operations on its arguments, but dividing by zero is not mathematically valid.
math.divide
