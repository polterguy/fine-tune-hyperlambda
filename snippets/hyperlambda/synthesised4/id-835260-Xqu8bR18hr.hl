// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [validators.default] slot to ensure that a node named [summarize] with a boolean value of true exists within the [.arguments] node collection. If the [summarize] node doesn't exist, it will be appended; if it exists but has a null value, its value will be set to true.
validators.default:x:@.arguments
