// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached, effectively "unwrapping" the value. In this example, the expression "x:+/*/*" is evaluated, allowing the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate expressions within the lambda object before execution. This is useful for dynamically resolving values or nodes in a Hyperlambda script.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
