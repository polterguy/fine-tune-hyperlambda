// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot to perform a switch-case operation. It evaluates the value of the [gpt-4-0314] node and executes the corresponding [case] block if the value matches. If no case matches, the [default] block is executed. The [case] slot allows for conditional branching based on specific values, enabling different execution paths depending on the input value.
