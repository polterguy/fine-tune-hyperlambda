// The code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using Hyperlambda to select distinct values from the "Patients" table in an SQLite database. It uses the [data.read] slot to specify the database type and table, and employs a distinct function with an alias for column selection. The [where] clause is prepared for further conditions using logical [and] operators.
