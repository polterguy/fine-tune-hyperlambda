/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet replaces occurrences of a specific string within a target string with another string. The [strings.replace] slot is used to perform the replacement operation. The first argument specifies the string to be replaced, which is retrieved using the [type] slot. The second argument specifies the replacement string, which is obtained from the value of the [type] node within the [.arguments] node. The result of this operation is stored in the [.result] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a specified string within a target string.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the string to be replaced.
 * 3. [get-value] - Obtains the replacement string from the [.arguments] node.
