/*
 * 1. `@signal`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "signal" in the current context. It begins the expression by locating this specific node.
 *    
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "signal" node. It allows the expression to access any direct children nodes under "signal".
 * 
 * 3. `context`: This iterator filters the children nodes obtained from the previous step to only include nodes with the name "context". It narrows down the result to nodes specifically named "context".
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * 
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access the "context" node within a "signal" node structure, perhaps to retrieve or manipulate context-specific data related to a signal processing task.
 * - It might be useful in an event-driven system where "signal" nodes represent events and "context" nodes contain metadata or additional information about these events.
