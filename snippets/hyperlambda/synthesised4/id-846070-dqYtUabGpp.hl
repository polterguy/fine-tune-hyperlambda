// This code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to modify the value of the [.completion] node. It concatenates a newline character with the current value of [.completion] using the [strings.concat] slot, effectively adding a newline at the beginning of the [.completion] node's value. The [get-value] slot retrieves the current value of [.completion] to be used in the concatenation process.
