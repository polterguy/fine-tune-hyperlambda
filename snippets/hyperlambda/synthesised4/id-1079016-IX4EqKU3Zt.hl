/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "new-prompt" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it should search for a node by name. The `.` before `new-prompt` specifies that the search should begin at the current node level, not traversing siblings or ancestors. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve a specific configuration or parameter node named "new-prompt" within a larger Hyperlambda structure, possibly to use its value in subsequent operations.
 * - It might be used in a conditional check to determine if a particular feature or prompt is enabled or configured in a certain way within the current context.
