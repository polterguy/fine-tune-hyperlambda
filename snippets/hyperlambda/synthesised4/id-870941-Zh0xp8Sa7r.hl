// This Hyperlambda code adds nodes to the current context by retrieving nodes from the result of an [execute-file] invocation. The [add] slot is used to append the nodes from the [execute-file] result to the current node set, specifically targeting nodes named [return] within the current context. The [get-nodes] slot fetches all nodes from the [execute-file] invocation, allowing them to be added to the specified location.
