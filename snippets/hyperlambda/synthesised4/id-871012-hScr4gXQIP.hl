// This Hyperlambda code concatenates several values into a single string and assigns it to the [.tmp] node. It retrieves the value of [.context], adds two newline characters, then appends the [prompt] and [completion] values from the [execute] node, each followed by two newline characters. The [strings.concat] slot is used to perform the concatenation, and [set-value] assigns the result to [.tmp].
