/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet updates the value of a node named [.result] by replacing occurrences of a placeholder string [[header]] within it. The placeholder is replaced with a processed version of the [header] argument, where all backslashes are removed. The code uses [strings.replace] to substitute the placeholder with the modified header value, which is obtained using [get-first-value] to ensure a single non-null value is returned. The [strings.replace] slot is used twice: first to remove backslashes from the header, and second to replace the placeholder in [.result]. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.result] node.
 * 2. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of [[header]] in [.result].
 * 3. [get-first-value] - Retrieves the first non-null value from its children nodes.
 * 4. [strings.replace] - Removes backslashes from the [header] argument.
 * 5. [.:"\\"] - Specifies the string to be replaced (backslash).
 * 6. [.:""] - Specifies the replacement string (empty string).
