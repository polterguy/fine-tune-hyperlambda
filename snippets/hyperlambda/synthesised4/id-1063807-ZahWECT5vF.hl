/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by locating the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. The `.arguments` node is typically used to define or access arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It effectively expands the search to include every direct child node under `.arguments`. This is useful when you want to process or evaluate each argument individually or collectively.
 * 
 * 3. `/module`: This iterator filters the results from the previous step to include only those nodes named `module`. It narrows down the selection to nodes specifically named `module` among the children of `.arguments`. This is particularly useful when you are interested in a specific argument or parameter passed to a function, identified by the name `module`.
