// This Hyperlambda code uses the [crypto.hash.sha256] slot to generate a SHA256 hash of the data located at [.data]. The resulting hash is formatted as a fingerprint, which is a human-readable representation of the hash, often used for easier storage and transmission. The [format] node specifies the output format of the hash.
