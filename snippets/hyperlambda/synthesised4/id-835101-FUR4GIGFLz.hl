// The code snippet demonstrates the use of a [try] block to execute a sequence of operations safely. It initializes a node [.x] and adds nodes obtained from [hyper2lambda] to it using [add]. Then, it evaluates the content of [.x] using [eval]. If the operations succeed without exceptions, it returns a [result] node with the value "success".
