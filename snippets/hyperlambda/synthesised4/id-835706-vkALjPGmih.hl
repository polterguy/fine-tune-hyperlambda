// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to append nodes to a specified location. It retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node using [get-nodes] for both [order] and [direction], and appends them to the [data.read] node. The [add] slot is used to insert these nodes into the specified path, effectively modifying the node structure by adding new nodes based on the retrieved values.
