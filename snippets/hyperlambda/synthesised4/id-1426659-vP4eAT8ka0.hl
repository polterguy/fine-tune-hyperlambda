/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [lambda2hyper] slot to convert the result of an HTTP GET request into a Hyperlambda string. The [lambda2hyper] slot takes a lambda object and transforms it into a textual Hyperlambda representation. This can be useful for persisting the result of an HTTP request or transferring it to another server. The expression in the [lambda2hyper] slot points to the result of the [http.get] invocation, which retrieves data from a specified URL.
 * 1. [lambda2hyper] - Converts a lambda object into a Hyperlambda string.
 * 2. [http.get] - Performs an HTTP GET request to retrieve data from a specified URL.
