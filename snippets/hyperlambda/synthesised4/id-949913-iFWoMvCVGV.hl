// The code throws an exception with a message indicating a 401 Unauthorized error due to an invalid or missing token. The [throw] slot is used to generate the exception, which can be configured to propagate to the client by setting the [public] parameter to true. This allows the client to receive the error message, even in release builds, if not caught by a [.catch] block.
