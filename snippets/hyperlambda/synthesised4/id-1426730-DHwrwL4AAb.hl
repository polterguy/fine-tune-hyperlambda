/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * // The [get-value] slot is used to access the value of a node within the current execution context.
 * // In this example, the expression points to a node named [.domain], and the [get-value] slot returns its value.
 * // This is useful for extracting specific data from a node within a larger Hyperlambda structure.
 * // 1. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression.
 * // 2. [x:@.domain] - The expression pointing to the node whose value is to be retrieved.
