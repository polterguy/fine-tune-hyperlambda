/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [mt] slot to compare the value of the node referenced by the expression `@.imported` to the integer value `0`. It returns true if the value of the node is greater than `0`. 
 * 
 * 1. [mt] - Compares its two arguments and returns true if the first argument is more than the second.
 * 2. [x:@.imported] - Expression pointing to the node whose value is being compared.
 * 3. [.int:0] - Static integer value used as the second argument for comparison.
