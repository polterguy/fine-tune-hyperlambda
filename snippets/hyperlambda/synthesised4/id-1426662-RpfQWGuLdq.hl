// The [signal] slot is used to invoke a previously created dynamic slot. In this context, it takes an expression pointing to a node, and the node's value is expected to be a reference to a dynamic slot that will be executed. The [signal] slot allows for dynamic invocation of functionality based on the node's value, enabling flexible and modular code execution.
