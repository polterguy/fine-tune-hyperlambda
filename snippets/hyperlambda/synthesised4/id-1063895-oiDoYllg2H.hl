/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves one step down in the hierarchy to the next node, which is the node immediately following the current node. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the node that comes directly after the current node in the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. After moving to the elder sibling node using the `+` iterator, the `*` iterator will gather all the children of this sibling node. This is useful for operations that need to process or evaluate all child nodes of a specific sibling node in the structure.
