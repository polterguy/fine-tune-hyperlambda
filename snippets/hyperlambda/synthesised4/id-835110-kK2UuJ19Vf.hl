// This Hyperlambda code checks if a file named "magic.backup" exists in the "/data" directory using the [io.file.exists] slot. If the file is found, the [io.file.delete] slot is executed to delete the file. The [if] slot is used to conditionally execute the deletion based on the existence of the file.
if
   io.file.exists:/data/magic.backup
   .lambda
      io.file.delete:/data/magic.backup
