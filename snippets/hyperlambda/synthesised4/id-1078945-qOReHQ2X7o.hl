/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "session" that is either the current node or an ancestor node. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors up in the hierarchy. This is useful for retrieving session-related data that might be stored in a node named "session" within a larger Hyperlambda structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing session variables or data stored in a session node to maintain state across different parts of an application.
 * - Retrieving user-specific data stored in a session node for personalization or authentication purposes.
