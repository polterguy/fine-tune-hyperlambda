// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.prompt] node by concatenating the string "Image - " with the name of a file. It retrieves the file name from the [.arguments] node, specifically from the [file] node's [name] child, and appends it to the static string. This operation effectively creates a prompt or message that includes the file name.
