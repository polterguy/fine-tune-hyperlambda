// The code snippet uses logical conditions to evaluate an HTTP response status code. It checks if the status code is not within the range of 200 to 299, indicating an unsuccessful HTTP request. The [not] slot negates the result of the [and] condition, which checks if the status code is more than or equal to 200 and less than 300.
