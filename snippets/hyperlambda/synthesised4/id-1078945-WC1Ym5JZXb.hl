/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it) of the current node. It's used to navigate to the next node in the hierarchy. This can be useful when you need to process nodes sequentially or when the structure of your data requires moving to the next sibling node.
 * 
 * 2. `/+` - This iterator again retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It is used consecutively after the first `+` to move further down the sibling chain. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to skip over certain nodes or reach a specific sibling node that is not immediately adjacent.
 * 
 * 3. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access the children of the node that was reached after the sibling navigation. This is useful when you need to process or evaluate all child nodes of a particular node.
 * 
 * 4. `/*` - This iterator again retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used consecutively to delve deeper into the hierarchy, accessing the children of the previously retrieved children nodes. This is useful for navigating through nested structures or when dealing with hierarchical data.
 * 
 * 5. `/.sse` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node and then filters to find the first node with the name ".sse". It is used to navigate up the hierarchy and then select a specific node by name. This is useful when you need to find a specific node type within a certain context or when you need to apply operations to a specific node type.
 * 
 * 6. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the ".sse" node. It is used to access the children of the ".sse" node, allowing for further processing or evaluation of these nodes. This is useful when you need to work with all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 7. `/.type` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node and then filters to find the first node with the name ".type". It is used to navigate up the hierarchy and then select a specific node by name. This is useful when you need to determine the type of a node or when you need to apply operations based on node type.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include navigating complex data structures where sibling and child relationships are important, such as in XML or JSON-like data, or when processing hierarchical configurations where specific node types need to be identified and manipulated.
