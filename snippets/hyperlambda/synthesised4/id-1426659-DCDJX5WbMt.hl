// The code snippet uses the [html2lambda] slot to convert HTML content obtained from an HTTP GET request into a lambda object. The expression `x:@http.get/*/content` retrieves the content node from the HTTP GET response, which is then processed by [html2lambda] to transform the HTML structure into a corresponding lambda structure. This allows for manipulation and traversal of the HTML content as a lambda object.
html2lambda:x:@http.get/*/content
