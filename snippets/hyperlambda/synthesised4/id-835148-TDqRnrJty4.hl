// The code checks if the node pointed to by the expression [.dp/#/*/embedding_vss] is not null. If the node exists and has a value, it sets the value of the same node to boolean true. This is done using the [if] slot with a [not-null] condition, and a [set-value] operation within a [.lambda] block.
