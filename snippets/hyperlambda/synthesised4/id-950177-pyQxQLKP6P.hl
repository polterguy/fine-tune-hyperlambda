// This Hyperlambda code snippet retrieves a value from a specified path within an HTTP GET response and assigns it to the [.cat-fact] node. The [set-value] slot changes the value of the [.cat-fact] node to the result obtained from the [get-value] slot, which extracts data from the HTTP response structure.
