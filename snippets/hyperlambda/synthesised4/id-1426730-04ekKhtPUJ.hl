// This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.replace-not-of] slot to replace every character in the string referenced by [.value] that is not a digit (0-9) with an empty string, effectively removing all non-digit characters from the string. The first argument specifies the allowed characters (digits), and the second argument is an empty string, indicating that disallowed characters should be removed.
