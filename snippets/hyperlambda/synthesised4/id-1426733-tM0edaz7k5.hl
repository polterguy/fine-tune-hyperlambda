// This Hyperlambda code snippet evaluates two conditions using the [or] slot, which returns true if either of the conditions is true. The first condition checks if the value of the [completion] node within the [.dp] node is equal to the value of the [completion] node. The second condition checks if the value of the [completion] node is similar to the result of the [strings.concat] operation. The [or] slot is used to determine if at least one of these conditions is met.
