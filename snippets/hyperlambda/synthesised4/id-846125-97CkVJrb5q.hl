// Sets the value of the node referenced by [set-value] to the first value obtained from [get-first-value], which retrieves values from both [get-value] pointing to [webhook_outgoing] and [config.get] accessing a configuration setting. This operation effectively updates the [outgoing] node with a prioritized value from either a webhook argument or a configuration setting.
