// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing you to forward evaluate expressions inside your lambda object. In this example, the expression "+/*/*" is evaluated, and the resulting nodes are unwrapped, meaning their values are resolved and assigned to the node where [unwrap] is used. This is useful for dynamically determining node values based on other parts of the Hyperlambda graph.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
