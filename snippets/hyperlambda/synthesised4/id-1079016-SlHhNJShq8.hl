/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors. This is often used to access the root arguments node in a Hyperlambda file or endpoint, which typically contains input parameters or data passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node found in the previous step. It is used to access each parameter or piece of data passed into the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `data`: This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to only include nodes named `data`. It is used to specifically target a node that is expected to contain relevant data or a specific parameter within the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a specific data node within the arguments of a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to perform operations on that data.
 * - Retrieving input data passed to an HTTP endpoint for processing or validation.
