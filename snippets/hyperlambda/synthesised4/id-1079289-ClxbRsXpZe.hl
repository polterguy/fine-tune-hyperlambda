/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the `.arguments` node. The `*` symbol is used to access all direct child nodes of the node found by the previous iterator.
 * 
 * 3. `limit` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `limit`. It will select nodes among the children of `.arguments` that have the name `limit`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve a specific argument named `limit` from a set of arguments passed to a function or endpoint. This is useful in scenarios where you need to enforce or apply a limit on operations, such as pagination or restricting the number of results returned by a query.
