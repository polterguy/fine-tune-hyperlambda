/*
 * 1. `@.invoke`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "invoke" that is an ancestor of the current node. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors up in the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is higher up in the hierarchy, such as retrieving configuration or context information that is shared across multiple nodes or operations. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a parent node that contains configuration settings or parameters needed for the current operation.
 * - Retrieving a context or state node that influences the behavior of the current node's logic.
