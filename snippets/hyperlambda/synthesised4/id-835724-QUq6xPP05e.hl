// The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to any of the specified roles: admin, guest, or root. If the user does not belong to any of these roles, the slot will throw an exception, ensuring that only users with the appropriate roles can proceed. This is typically used to secure endpoints by verifying user roles before allowing access.
