/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [case] slot to handle a specific data type, in this case, "tinyblob". The [case] slot is typically used within a [switch] statement to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable or expression. Here, the [case] slot is used to identify and handle the "tinyblob" data type, which is a type of binary data storage in SQL databases. This allows for conditional logic to be applied specifically when dealing with "tinyblob" data, enabling customized processing or handling of this data type.
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Represents a specific condition or value, in this case, "tinyblob", to be matched within a [switch] statement.
