/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named "hyper2lambda" within the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a match. This is useful when you want to access a specific node by name, regardless of its position relative to the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `0` - This iterator retrieves the first child node of the node found by the previous iterator. In this context, it is used to access the first child of the "hyper2lambda" node. This can be useful when you know that the node you're interested in is the first child, or when the order of child nodes is significant.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access a specific configuration or data node named "hyper2lambda" and you are interested in its first child node, perhaps to retrieve a default setting or value associated with that configuration.
