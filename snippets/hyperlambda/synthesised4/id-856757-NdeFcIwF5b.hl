// This code snippet uses the [else] slot to execute a block of code when previous conditions are not met. It sets the value of the [prompt] node under [.dp] by retrieving the content from the first choice message in the HTTP POST response. The [set-value] slot updates the [prompt] node's value, and the [get-value] slot extracts the desired content from the HTTP response.
