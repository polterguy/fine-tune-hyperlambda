// This Hyperlambda expression uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate an expression before the node it's referenced in is reached. The expression `x:+/*/*` starts from the current node, moves to its elder sibling, and retrieves all grandchildren nodes of the elder sibling. The [unwrap] slot evaluates this expression, effectively unwrapping the nodes it points to, before the [return] node is executed. The [return] node then returns a lambda object with a [found] node set to false and a [sitemap] node. The [sitemap] node's value is dynamically constructed using the [strings.concat] slot, which concatenates a list of strings into one string. This setup can be useful for scenarios where you need to preprocess or transform data before returning it, such as preparing a sitemap or aggregating data from multiple nodes.
