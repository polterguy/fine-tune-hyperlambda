/*
 * 1. `@auth.token.verify` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `auth.token.verify` in the current context. It is typically used to access a specific node where authentication token verification details are stored.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `auth.token.verify` node. It is useful for accessing any sub-nodes that may contain additional details or configurations related to token verification.
 * 
 * 3. `issuer` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `issuer` among the children of `auth.token.verify`. It is used to specifically access the issuer information of the authentication token, which is crucial for validating the source of the token.
 * 
 * **Use Cases:**
 * 
 * - This expression can be used in an authentication system to verify the issuer of a token, ensuring that it was issued by a trusted source.
 * - It can also be used in logging or monitoring systems to track and audit the origin of authentication tokens for security purposes.
