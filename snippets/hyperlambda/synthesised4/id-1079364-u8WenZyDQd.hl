/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named [sql] in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, and the `.` symbol indicates that it will start the search from the current node's parent. This means it will look for a sibling node named [sql] that is at the same level as the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve the value of a [sql] node that contains an SQL query or command, allowing the current node to execute or manipulate the SQL statement.
 * - It could be used in a context where multiple SQL statements are defined as sibling nodes, and the expression is used to dynamically select and execute one of them based on some condition or logic.
