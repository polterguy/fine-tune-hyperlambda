/*
 * 1. `@data.read` - This iterator starts by locating the first node with the name "data.read" in the current context. It serves as the starting point for the expression, focusing on a specific node within the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "data.read" node. It expands the search to include all immediate descendants of the "data.read" node, allowing further exploration of the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator goes one level deeper, retrieving all children of each node found in the previous step. It enables the expression to explore the hierarchy two levels down from the "data.read" node.
 * 
 * 4. `password` - This iterator filters the results to include only nodes with the name "password" from the current set of nodes. It narrows down the search to focus specifically on nodes named "password" within the explored hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving user passwords stored within a specific data structure for authentication or validation purposes.
 * - Extracting sensitive information for security audits or compliance checks, ensuring only relevant password nodes are accessed.
