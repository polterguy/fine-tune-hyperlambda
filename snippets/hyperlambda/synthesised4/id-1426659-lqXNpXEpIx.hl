// This Hyperlambda code checks if the string obtained from a specific node does not start with "https://". It uses [strings.starts-with] to determine if the string begins with "https://", and the [not] slot negates the result, effectively returning true if the string does not start with "https://". The expression in [strings.starts-with] navigates through a node structure to find the target string.
