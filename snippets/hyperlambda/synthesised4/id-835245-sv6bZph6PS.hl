// The code snippet uses the [insert-before] slot to insert nodes before a specific node in the hierarchy. It targets the first [fork] node under the current context and inserts nodes obtained from the [get-nodes] slot, which references nodes at the [invoke] path. This operation effectively places the retrieved nodes before the specified [fork] node.
