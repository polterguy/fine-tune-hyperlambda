/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda) of the current node. It is useful when you want to access nodes that are at the same level in the hierarchy but appear after the current node.
 * 2. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current result set. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node.
 * 3. `/*` - This iterator again retrieves all children nodes of the current result set, allowing you to access the grandchildren of the original node.
 * 4. `/exists` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "exists". It is useful when you are looking for specific nodes by name within the hierarchy.
