/*
 * 1. `@version`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "version" from the current context. It is used to access a specific node directly by its name. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to quickly access the version information of an application or module within a larger Hyperlambda structure.
 * - It can be useful for checking compatibility or ensuring that the correct version of a component is being used.
