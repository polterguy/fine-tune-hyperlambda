// The Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and expand a complex expression. The expression navigates through the node hierarchy, starting from the current node's elder sibling (indicated by '+'), then traversing down three levels of children nodes (indicated by '/*/*/*'). The [unwrap] slot ensures that the expression is evaluated before the current node is processed, allowing the resulting nodes to be used or manipulated in subsequent operations.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*
