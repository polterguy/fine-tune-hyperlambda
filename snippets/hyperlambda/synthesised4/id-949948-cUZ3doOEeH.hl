// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes from one collection to another. It retrieves all nodes from the [.registry] node using [get-nodes] and appends them to the [.storage] node's children collection. This operation effectively copies the structure and content of [.registry] into [.storage], allowing for dynamic graph manipulation within Hyperlambda.
