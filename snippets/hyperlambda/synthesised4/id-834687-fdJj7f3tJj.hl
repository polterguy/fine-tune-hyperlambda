// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node it's referenced in is executed, allowing for forward evaluation. In this example, the expression [x:+/*/*] is unwrapped, meaning that any nodes or values it points to will be evaluated and resolved before the execution reaches the node containing the [unwrap] slot. This is useful for dynamically resolving values or nodes in a Hyperlambda graph.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
