// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database named "appdb" and reads data from the "users" table, limiting the result to a single record. The [data.connect] slot establishes the database connection, while the [data.read] slot specifies the table and the [limit] slot restricts the number of records returned to 1.
data.connect:appdb
   data.read
      table:users
      limit:int:1
