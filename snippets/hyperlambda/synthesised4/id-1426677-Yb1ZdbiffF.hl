// The Hyperlambda code snippet unwraps and evaluates all expressions found within the [.task] node, which is a child of the [.lambda] node. This is achieved by using the [unwrap] slot, which processes the expressions sequentially, ensuring that any expressions within the [.task] node are executed and their results are returned. The expression navigates through the node hierarchy to locate the [.task] node, starting from the current node, moving to its elder sibling, then to its elder sibling's child, and finally to the [.lambda] node's child. This operation is useful for dynamically evaluating and executing tasks defined within a Hyperlambda graph object.
