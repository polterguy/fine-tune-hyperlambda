/*
 * The code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to update the value of the [.file-meta] node by concatenating its current value with a string " - Filename: " and the value of the node referenced by [.dp]. The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine these strings. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the [.file-meta] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 3. [get-value] (first occurrence) - Retrieves the current value of [.file-meta].
 * 4. [.] - Static string to be concatenated.
 * 5. [get-value] (second occurrence) - Retrieves the value of the node referenced by [.dp].
