/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node named "new-prompt" within the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node's siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name that is located somewhere above the current node in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or metadata nodes that are defined at a higher level in the hierarchy.
 * - Retrieving a specific node that acts as a flag or marker within a larger structure.
