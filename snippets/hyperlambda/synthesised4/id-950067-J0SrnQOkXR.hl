// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each child node of [.arguments] using [for-each], and for each node, it sends an email using [mail.smtp.send]. The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate and expand the current node's expressions. The email is sent to the address specified in the current node's value, with a static subject and body content. The [to] node dynamically retrieves the email address from the current [.dp] node.
