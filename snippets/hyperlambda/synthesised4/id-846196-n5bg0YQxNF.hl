// This Hyperlambda code checks multiple conditions using the [and] slot to ensure all conditions are true. It verifies the existence and non-null status of a node named [references] within [.arguments], retrieves its value, and checks for the existence of a [snippets] node within [signal]. The [and] slot will only evaluate to true if all these conditions are met.
