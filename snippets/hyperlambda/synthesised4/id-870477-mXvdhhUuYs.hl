// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else-if] slot in Hyperlambda. It checks if the value of the node pointed to by the expression [mt:x:@.lhs/#] is greater than the value obtained from [get-value:x:@.rhs/#]. If this condition is true, it executes the [.lambda] block, setting the value of [.result] to -1 using [set-value].
