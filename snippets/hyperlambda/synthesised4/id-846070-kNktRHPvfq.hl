// This Hyperlambda code checks if a string does not start with "https://". It uses [strings.starts-with] to evaluate if the value of a node, specified by the expression, begins with "https://". The [not] slot logically inverts the result, returning true if the string does not start with "https://". The expression navigates through nodes to find the target string.
