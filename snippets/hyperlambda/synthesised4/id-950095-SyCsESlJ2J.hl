// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [case] slot to check for a specific integer value, 400. If the condition is met, it sets the value of the [.result] node to "Bad Request" using the [set-value] slot. This pattern is typically used within a [switch] statement to handle different cases based on the value of a node.
case:int:400
   set-value:x:@.result
      .:Bad Request
