// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses a [case] slot with an integer value of 80, followed by a [log.info] slot that logs the message "Great job!". The [case] slot is typically used in conjunction with a [switch] statement to execute specific code blocks based on matching values. Here, it seems to be standalone, logging the message if the case condition is met.
case:int:80
   log.info:Great job!
