/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [case] slot to evaluate a tinyint value and execute different branches based on its value. The [case] slot is used for conditional branching, similar to a switch statement in other programming languages. The code checks the value of the [tinyint] node and executes the corresponding branch based on its value.
 * 
 * 1. [tinyint] - Declares a node with a tinyint value.
 * 2. [switch] - Initiates a switch statement to evaluate the value of the [tinyint] node.
 * 3. [case] - Specifies a branch to execute if the [tinyint] value matches the specified case value.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the [case] condition is met.
 * 5. [default] - Provides a branch to execute if none of the [case] conditions are met.
