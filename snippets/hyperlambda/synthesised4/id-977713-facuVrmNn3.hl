// This Hyperlambda code performs an HTTP POST request to validate a session by sending a session ID to the specified URL. It uses the [http.post] slot with a [payload] node containing the session ID, which is dynamically retrieved using a lambda expression. The [convert] argument is set to true, indicating that the response should be automatically converted to the appropriate type based on the response content type.
