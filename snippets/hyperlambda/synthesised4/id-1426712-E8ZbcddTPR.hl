// This Hyperlambda code snippet evaluates two conditions using the [and] slot, which will only return true if both conditions are true. The first condition checks if the string value of the [result] node contains the substring "FUNCTION_INVOCATION[" using the [strings.contains] slot. The second condition checks if the value of the [has-sent-waiting] node is not equal to true using the [neq] slot. If both conditions are met, the [and] slot will evaluate to true.
