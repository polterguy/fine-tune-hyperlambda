/*
 * 1. `@.max-size`: This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "max-size" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, and the `.` before `max-size` specifies that it should start the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate the value of a specific node named "max-size" within the current scope. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a configuration value or limit that is stored under a node named "max-size" in the current context.
 * - Checking or updating the maximum size constraint for a data structure or operation.
