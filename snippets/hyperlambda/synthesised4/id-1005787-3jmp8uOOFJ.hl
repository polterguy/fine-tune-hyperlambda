/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator looks for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name.
 *    
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access the nodes directly under the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `file`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `file`. It selects nodes named `file` from the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 4. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `file` node. It is used to access the nodes directly under the `file` node.
 * 
 * 5. `stream`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `stream`. It selects nodes named `stream` from the children of the `file` node.
 * 
 * This expression is used to navigate through a hierarchical structure, starting from a node named `.arguments`, then accessing its children, filtering for a node named `file`, accessing its children, and finally filtering for a node named `stream`. This is useful for accessing specific data within a nested structure, such as retrieving a file stream from an HTTP request's arguments.
