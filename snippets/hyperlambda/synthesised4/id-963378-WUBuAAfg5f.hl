// The code retrieves a scalar value from an ODBC database connection and assigns it to the [site-title] node using the [yield] slot. The [odbc.connect] slot establishes a connection to the database, and [odbc.scalar] executes a SQL query to fetch a single value. The result is then stored in [site-title] for further use.
