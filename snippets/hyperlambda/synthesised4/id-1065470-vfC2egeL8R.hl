// 1. `@.fields`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "fields" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` implies it starts the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate a specific node named "fields" within the current hierarchical structure, such as retrieving its value or further processing its children nodes.
