// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of a [case] node within a switch statement to handle a specific scenario. When the evaluated value matches "double precision", the code sets the value of the [.type] node to "double" using the [set-value] slot. This is useful for dynamically assigning types based on conditions.
case:double precision
   set-value:x:@.type
      .:double
