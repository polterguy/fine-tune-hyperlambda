// The Hyperlambda code snippet uses an [and] slot to define a logical condition for joining tables. It specifies that the "ReportsTo" column in the "Employees" table should match the "EmployeeID" column in the "ReportsTo" table, facilitating an inner join operation based on these matching columns. This ensures that only records with corresponding values in both tables are included in the result set.
