/*
 * This expression is a lambda expression in Hyperlambda, which is used to reference nodes within the currently executed graph object. Let's break down the expression step-by-step:
 * 
 * 1. `@.words`: This part of the expression uses the `@` iterator to find the first node with the name "words" in the current context. The `@` iterator searches for a node with the specified name starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node found in the previous step. In this case, it retrieves all children nodes of the "words" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to iterate over all children of a node named "words" to perform operations on each child node, such as processing a list of words or terms.
 * - It could be used in a [for-each] loop to apply a transformation or validation to each word in a collection of words stored as children nodes under a "words" node.
