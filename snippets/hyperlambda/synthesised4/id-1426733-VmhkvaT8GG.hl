/*
 * /*
 *  * This Hyperlambda code snippet concatenates the values of specific nodes and sets the result to a target node. 
 *  * It retrieves the value of the [prompt] node and the [completion] node, separated by two newline characters, 
 *  * and assigns the concatenated string to the [.tmp] node.
 *  * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 *  * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 *  * 3. [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/prompt] - Retrieves the value of the [prompt] node.
 *  * 4. [.] - Represents a static string value, in this case, two newline characters.
 *  * 5. [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/completion] - Retrieves the value of the [completion] node.
