// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [math.multiply] slot to calculate the product of two values. It retrieves the values of the [quantity] and [unitPrice] nodes from the current node referenced by [.dp], and multiplies them together. This is useful for calculating total prices or similar operations where two numerical values need to be multiplied.
math.multiply
   get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/quantity
   get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/unitPrice
