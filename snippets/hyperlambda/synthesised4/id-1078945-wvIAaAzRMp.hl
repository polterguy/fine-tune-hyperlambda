/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator searches for the first node named "result" within the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, looking for a node with the name "result". This is useful when you need to access a specific node's value or reference it for further operations within the Hyperlambda script. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve the value of a "result" node after executing a series of operations, allowing you to use this result in subsequent logic or calculations.
