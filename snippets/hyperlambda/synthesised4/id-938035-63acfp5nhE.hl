// This Hyperlambda code connects to the "chinook" SQLite database and executes a SQL query to join the "Artist" and "Album" tables. It retrieves the artist names and album titles, orders the results by artist name, and limits the output to 50 records. The results are returned as nodes from the [data.select] execution.
