// The [context] slot is used to add an object onto the stack, which can later be retrieved using the [get-context] slot. It requires a name as its value, a [value] node for the data to be stored, and a [.lambda] node where the stack object exists. This allows for persistent data access throughout the execution of a Hyperlambda snippet, including invoked slots or executed Hyperlambda files. The provided code sets a context named "context" for later retrieval.
