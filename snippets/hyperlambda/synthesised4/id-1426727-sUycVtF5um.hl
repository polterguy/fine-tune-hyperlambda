// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied to the node immediately following it, which is the elder sibling of the current node due to the "+" iterator. The "/**" iterator is used to include all descendants of the elder sibling node in the evaluation. This allows the expressions within the elder sibling node and all its descendants to be evaluated before the current node is processed.
unwrap:x:+/**
