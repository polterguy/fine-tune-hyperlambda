// This Hyperlambda code checks two conditions using the [and] slot: it verifies the existence of a node at the path [@execute/0] using [exists], and ensures that the number of tokens required for the text in [.context] is less than 4000 using [lt] and [openai.tokenize]. If both conditions are true, the [and] slot evaluates to true.
