// The [execute] slot in Hyperlambda is used to invoke a dynamically created slot while automatically evaluating all descendant nodes. In this example, it executes the "whatever-slot" with arguments [arg1] and [arg2] derived from the [.args] node, ensuring these arguments are evaluated to their static values before invocation.
execute:whatever-slot
