// This Hyperlambda code uses the [and] slot to evaluate multiple conditions. It checks if the value of [.node-name] is "execute" using [eq], and verifies the existence of "name" and "filename" nodes within the [.dp] node's children using [exists]. All conditions must be true for the [and] slot to evaluate to true.
