// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, `notes` and `clients`, using the `client_id` as the joining key. The [join] slot specifies the table to join, [as] assigns an alias to the `clients` table, [type] indicates the type of join, and [on] defines the condition for the join using an [and] logical operator to match `client_id` from both tables.
