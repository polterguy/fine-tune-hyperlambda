/*
 * This expression is a lambda expression used to reference a specific node within a Hyperlambda graph. Let's break down the expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@` - This iterator is used to find the first node with a specific name. In this case, it looks for the first node named "sql" within the current context or hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `.sql` - This is the name of the node being referenced. The expression is searching for a node with this exact name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve or manipulate the value of a node named "sql" within a Hyperlambda script, which might contain SQL query strings or database connection information.
 * - It could be part of a larger Hyperlambda script that dynamically constructs or executes SQL queries based on the node's content.
