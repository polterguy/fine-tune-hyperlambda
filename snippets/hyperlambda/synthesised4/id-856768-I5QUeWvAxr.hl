// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, [unwrap] is used to evaluate the expression pointing to a node with a [message] child, ensuring the value is processed before the instruction pointer reaches the node, allowing for dynamic evaluation within the lambda object.
