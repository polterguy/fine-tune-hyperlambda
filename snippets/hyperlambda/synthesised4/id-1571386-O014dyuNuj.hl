 * 1. `@json2lambda` - Selects the first ancestor or self node with the name [.json2lambda].
 * 2. `*` - Retrieves all children of the [.json2lambda] node.
 * 3. `choices` - Filters the result to only nodes named [choices] among the children.
 * 4. `0` - Selects the first child node (index 0) of the [choices] node.
 * 5. `*` - Retrieves all children of the [0] node.
 * 6. `delta` - Filters the result to only nodes named [delta] among the children.
 * 7. `*` - Retrieves all children of the [delta] node.
 * 8. `content` - Filters the result to only nodes named [content] among the children.
 * 
 * This expression navigates from the nearest [.json2lambda] ancestor, drills down through its [choices] child, selects the first item ([0]), then its [delta] child, and finally retrieves all [content] nodes within that structure.
