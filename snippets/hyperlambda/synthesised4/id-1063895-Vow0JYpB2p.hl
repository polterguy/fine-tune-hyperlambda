// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node named `.sql` within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node by name, and the `.` prefix specifies that it should search within the current node's hierarchy, specifically looking at the current node's children. This is useful when you want to retrieve a specific node by its name within the current context, such as fetching a SQL query or statement stored in a node named `.sql`.
