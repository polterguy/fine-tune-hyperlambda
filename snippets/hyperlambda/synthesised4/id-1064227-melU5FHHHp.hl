/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you want to navigate from a child node back to its parent node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access every child node under the current node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes named "data.read". It is used to specifically target nodes with this name, which might represent a data reading operation or context.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Similar to the previous `*`, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.read" nodes. It allows access to every child node under "data.read", which might contain parameters or configurations for the data reading operation.
 * 
 * 5. `where` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes named "where". It is typically used to specify conditions or criteria for filtering data, often in the context of querying or data retrieval operations.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "where" nodes. It is used to access every child node under "where", which might define specific conditions or expressions for filtering data.
