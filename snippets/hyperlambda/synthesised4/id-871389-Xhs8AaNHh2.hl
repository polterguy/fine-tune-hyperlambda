// The Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to query a SQLite database. It specifies the table "Regions" and aggregates a column using an "aggregate_functor", aliasing the result as "result". The query includes a [where] clause with an [and] condition and limits the result set to a single record. This setup is useful for retrieving specific aggregated data from a database table with conditions applied.
