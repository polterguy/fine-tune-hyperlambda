// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "sql" that is either a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It is useful when you want to access a specific node by name within the current context or hierarchy, especially when dealing with SQL-related operations or configurations in a Hyperlambda script.
