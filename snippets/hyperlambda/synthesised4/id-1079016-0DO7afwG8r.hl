/*
 * 1. `@strings.split`: This iterator locates the first node named "strings.split" within the current context. It is used to identify the node responsible for splitting a string based on a specified delimiter. This node is likely part of a process where a string is being divided into parts, such as splitting a CSV line into individual values.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the node identified by the previous iterator. In this context, it would gather all nodes that are children of the "strings.split" node. These children nodes might represent the individual parts of the string that have been split, such as tokens or segments derived from the original string.
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression could include processing a list of items separated by a delimiter, such as parsing a CSV line into individual fields or breaking down a sentence into words for further analysis.
