// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses an [if] statement to check if the value of the [get-name] node is equal to "wheel". If the condition is true, it executes the [.lambda] block, which sets the value of the current node (referenced by [.dp]) to "urgent restock". This demonstrates conditional execution based on node values.
