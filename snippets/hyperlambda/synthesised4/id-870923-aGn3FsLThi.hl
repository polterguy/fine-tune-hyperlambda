// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to execute a dynamic slot named "magic.auth.change-password" with two arguments: [password] and [is_hashed]. The [password] argument is expected to be provided as a lambda expression, while [is_hashed] indicates whether the password is already hashed. This setup is typically used to change a user's password in an authentication system, ensuring the password is securely handled, potentially as a hashed value.
execute:magic.auth.change-password
