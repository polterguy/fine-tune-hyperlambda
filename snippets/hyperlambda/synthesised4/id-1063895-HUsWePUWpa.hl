// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "sql" that is at the same level or higher in the hierarchy, relative to the current node. It is useful when you need to access a specific node by name that is located within the current context or its ancestors, allowing you to reference configuration or query nodes that are commonly used in database operations.
