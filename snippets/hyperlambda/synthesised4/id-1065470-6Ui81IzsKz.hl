/*
 * 1. `@data.select`: This iterator starts by locating the first node with the name "data.select" in the current context. It is used to navigate to a specific node within the hierarchy that matches this name. This is useful when you want to begin your expression from a specific node that might have a unique name within the structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the "data.select" node. It is used to access every direct child node under "data.select", regardless of their names. This is helpful when you want to perform operations or checks on all child nodes without filtering by name.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: The second `*` iterator retrieves all children of each node returned by the previous iterator. This effectively allows you to access the grandchildren of the "data.select" node. This is useful when you need to delve deeper into the hierarchy to access nodes that are two levels down from the starting point.
 * 
 * 4. `keyword_count`: This iterator filters the results to only include nodes named "keyword_count" from the set of nodes retrieved by the previous iterators. It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes with a specific name, which is essential when you are interested in processing or evaluating nodes with a particular purpose or data type.
