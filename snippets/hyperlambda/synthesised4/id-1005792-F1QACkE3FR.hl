/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy. It's useful for accessing arguments passed into a function or slot, especially in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints where arguments are typically encapsulated in an `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This retrieves all child nodes of the `.arguments` node. It's often used to access each argument passed into a function or slot, allowing you to perform operations on them or validate them.
 * 
 * 3. `limit` - This filters the result set to only include nodes named `limit` among the children of the `.arguments` node. It's typically used to access a specific argument named `limit`, which could be used to control the number of items processed or returned by a function or endpoint.
