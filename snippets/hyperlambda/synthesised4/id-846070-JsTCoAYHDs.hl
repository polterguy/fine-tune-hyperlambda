// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] block to define a branch of execution based on a specific value. When the value of the [switch] node matches the value of a [case] node, the children of that [case] node are executed. The [case] node must have a value, which can be a constant or an expression, and it is used to compare against the evaluated value of the [switch] node.
