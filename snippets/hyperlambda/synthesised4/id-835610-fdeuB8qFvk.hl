 * The code snippet changes the names of all nodes referenced by its expression to the value obtained from the [get-value] slot, which retrieves the value of the [group_column] node from the [.arguments] node. The [set-name] slot is used to modify the names of nodes, and the [get-value] slot fetches the required value to be used as the new name. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the names of nodes referenced by its expression.
