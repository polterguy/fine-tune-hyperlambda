/*
 * The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expressions of its children nodes before the node where it's referenced is reached, effectively "unwrapping" the expressions. In this example, it will evaluate the expressions of all descendant nodes of the current node, ensuring their values are resolved before proceeding. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions within a lambda object.

 * 1. [unwrap] - Evaluates the expressions of all descendant nodes of the current node before proceeding.
