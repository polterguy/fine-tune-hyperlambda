// 1. `@.fields` - This iterator looks for the first node with the name "fields" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It is useful when you need to access a specific node that may not be a direct child of the current node, but is guaranteed to be somewhere in the hierarchy above the current node. This is often used to retrieve configuration or context-specific data that is stored higher up in the node tree.
