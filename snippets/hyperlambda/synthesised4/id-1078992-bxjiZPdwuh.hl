/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name [.dp] in the current context. It is typically used to access a specific node that has been passed as a reference, often in the context of a loop or a dynamic slot execution.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the [.dp] node. It assumes that the value of [.dp] is another node, allowing you to work directly with the node referenced by [.dp] rather than just its value.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous result set. It is used to access every child node of the node that was de-referenced by the `#` iterator.
 * 
 * 4. `notnull` - This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes that have a name of "notnull". It is used to ensure that only nodes specifically named "notnull" are included in the final result set.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - This expression can be used in scenarios where you need to check or manipulate nodes that are specifically named "notnull" within a structure passed by reference. It could be part of a validation routine to ensure certain nodes are not null or to apply specific logic to these nodes.
