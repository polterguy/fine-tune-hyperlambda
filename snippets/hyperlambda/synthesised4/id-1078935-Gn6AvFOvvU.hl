/*
 * 1. `@get-count`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "get-count" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a match. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name, regardless of its position in the hierarchy, as long as it is an ancestor or sibling.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a configuration or setting node named "get-count" that is defined higher up in the hierarchy.
 * - Retrieving a node that holds a count or tally, which might be used in subsequent calculations or logic.
