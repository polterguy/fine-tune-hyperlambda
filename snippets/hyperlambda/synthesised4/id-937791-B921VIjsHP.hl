// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [sqlite.create] slot to insert a new record into the "albums" table. The [table] slot specifies the target table, while the [values] slot contains the fields and their respective values to be inserted, including "album_name", "artist", and "release_year". The use of parameters helps prevent SQL injection attacks by ensuring that data is safely inserted into the database.
