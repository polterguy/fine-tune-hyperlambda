/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement to execute different code blocks based on the value of a [case] node. It includes a [default] node to handle cases where no specific [case] matches. The code structure allows for conditional execution of code blocks, making it useful for scenarios where multiple conditions need to be evaluated and handled differently. 
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Initiates a switch statement to evaluate different cases.
 * 2. [case] - Defines a specific condition to match against.
 * 3. [default] - Provides a fallback action if no [case] conditions are met.
