/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks two conditions using an [if] statement with an [or] logical operator. It first checks if the sum of [time-challenge] and [age] is less than the current Unix time using [lt] and [math.add]. Then it checks if [time-challenge] is more than the current Unix time using [mt]. If either condition is true, it throws an exception with a message about an invalid CAPTCHA token, setting the status to 400 and making it public. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional statement.
 * 2. [or] - Combines two conditions, executing the block if either is true.
 * 3. [lt] - Checks if the result of the addition is less than the current Unix time.
 * 4. [math.add] - Adds [time-challenge] and [age].
 * 5. [get-value:x:@.time-challenge] - Retrieves the value of [time-challenge].
 * 6. [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/age] - Retrieves the value of [age].
 * 7. [date.unix] - Retrieves the current Unix time.
 * 8. [mt] - Checks if [time-challenge] is more than the current Unix time.
 * 9. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 10. [throw] - Throws an exception with a custom message and status.
