// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to create a new record in a SQLite database table named "questionnaires" using the [data.create] slot. The [database-type] is specified as "sqlite", and the [table] argument indicates the target table for the insertion. The [values] node is intended to contain the fields and their corresponding values for the new record, ensuring that the insertion is performed safely, protecting against SQL injection by using parameterized queries.
