// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to perform an addition operation on nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot. The [add] slot takes as input the nodes obtained from the [get-nodes] slot, which references a node set using a lambda expression. The [get-nodes] slot points to nodes within the [hyper2lambda] node, allowing the [add] slot to sum their values.
