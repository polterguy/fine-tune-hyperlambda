// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] construct to define a specific case to be evaluated. It compares the value of a given expression against the value of the [case] node, and if they match, executes the associated lambda block. The [case] slot can handle various data types, including decimal, allowing for precise numerical comparisons. This is useful for executing different code paths based on the exact value of a decimal number.
