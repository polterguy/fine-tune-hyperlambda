// The code demonstrates how to delete records from a "users" table where the username matches the currently authenticated user. It uses the [data.delete] slot to specify the table and the [where] clause to define the condition. The [username.eq] slot checks if the username equals the result of [auth.ticket.get], which retrieves the current user's username.
