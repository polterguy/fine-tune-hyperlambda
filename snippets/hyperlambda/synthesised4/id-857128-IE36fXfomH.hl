// The code snippet demonstrates a left join operation between two tables, "Orders" and "Employees", using the [join] slot. The join is performed on the "EmployeeID" column from both tables. The [as] slot is used to alias the "Employees" table as "EmployeeID", which is then referenced in the join condition. The [type] slot specifies the join type as "left", ensuring all records from the "Orders" table are included, even if there are no matching records in the "Employees" table.
