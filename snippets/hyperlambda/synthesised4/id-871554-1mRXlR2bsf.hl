// The [throw] slot is used to raise an exception in Hyperlambda. In this example, it throws an exception with a message derived from the value of the [.dp] node, which is passed by reference. The [throw] slot effectively interrupts the normal flow of execution, allowing error handling mechanisms to catch and process the exception.
