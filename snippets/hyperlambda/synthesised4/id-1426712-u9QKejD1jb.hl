// The [remove-nodes] slot in Hyperlambda is used to delete nodes from a node graph. It takes an expression as its argument, which specifies the nodes to be removed. When invoked, it removes all nodes that match the expression, effectively altering the structure of the node graph by eliminating the specified nodes. This operation is useful for dynamically modifying the node graph by removing unnecessary or unwanted nodes during the execution of a Hyperlambda script.
