/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the next sibling node of the current node. It is used to navigate horizontally across the node structure to the next node at the same level.
 * 2. `+` - Again, this retrieves the next sibling node of the current node. It continues the horizontal navigation to the next sibling.
 * 3. `+` - This retrieves yet another next sibling node, further continuing the horizontal navigation.
 * 4. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to navigate downwards into the node structure to access all child nodes.
 * 5. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the current node again, allowing for deeper navigation into the node structure.
 * 6. `.sse` - This retrieves the parent node of the current node that has the name `.sse`. It is used to find a specific ancestor node by name.
 * 7. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the `.sse` node, allowing access to all nodes directly under the `.sse` node.
 * 8. `.user-id` - This retrieves the parent node of the current node that has the name `.user-id`. It is used to find a specific ancestor node by name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to navigate a complex node structure to find a specific user ID associated with a particular SSE (Server-Sent Events) node. It could be useful in scenarios where you need to extract user-specific information from a data structure that includes SSE data.
