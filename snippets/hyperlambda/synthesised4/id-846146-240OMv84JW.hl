// This Hyperlambda code concatenates a static string "Summary; " with a substring extracted from the first 150 characters of a node's value, which is pointed to by a dynamic path expression. The [strings.concat] slot is used to join the static string with the result of the [strings.substring] operation, which extracts a portion of the string from the specified node.
