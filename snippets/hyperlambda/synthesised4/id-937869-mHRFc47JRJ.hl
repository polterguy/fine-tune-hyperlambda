// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.update] slot to update records in a SQLite database table named "Categories". The [database-type] slot specifies the database type as SQLite, while the [table] slot indicates the target table. The [values] slot is used to specify the columns and their new values for the update operation. The [where] slot, combined with the [and] slot, is used to define the conditions that determine which records will be updated.
