/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot with integer values. It is used within a [switch] statement to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a given integer. Each [case] node specifies a different integer value to match against, and if a match is found, the corresponding block of code is executed.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Initiates a switch statement to evaluate an expression and match it against specified cases.
 * 2. [case] - Defines an integer value to match against the expression provided in the [switch] statement.
 * 3. [default] - Provides a block of code to execute if none of the [case] values match the expression.
