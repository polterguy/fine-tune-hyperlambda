// This Hyperlambda code checks if a "description" node exists within the current node being iterated over. If it does, it unwraps the node's children and inserts the "description" node after the "name" node in the argument list. The key slots used are [if] for conditional checking, [exists] to verify the presence of the "description" node, [unwrap] to evaluate expressions, and [insert-after] to add the "description" node in the specified position.
