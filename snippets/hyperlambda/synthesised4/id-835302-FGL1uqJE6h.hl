// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot to evaluate a boolean expression. If the condition is true, it sets the value of the [type] node to "bool" using the [set-value] slot. This pattern is useful for conditional logic where specific actions are taken based on the evaluation of boolean conditions.
case:boolean
   set-value:x:@.type
      .:bool
