// The code snippet uses the [add] slot to insert nodes into a specific location within a Hyperlambda graph. It targets the [output] node inside the [args] node, which is a child of [sockets.signal]. The nodes being added are obtained using the [get-nodes] slot, which retrieves nodes from the result of an [execute-file] operation. This allows for dynamically adding the execution results of a file to a specific part of the Hyperlambda structure.
