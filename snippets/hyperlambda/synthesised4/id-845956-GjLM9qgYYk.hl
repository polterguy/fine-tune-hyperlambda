// This code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.request] node to the value retrieved from the [crypto.verify] slot. The [set-value] slot modifies the value of the node specified by its expression, while the [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the node specified in its expression. This operation effectively updates [.request] with the result of the cryptographic verification process.
set-value:x:@.request
   get-value:x:@crypto.verify
