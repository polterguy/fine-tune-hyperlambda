// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` implies it starts from the current node's context. This is useful for retrieving a specific node named "sql" that might contain SQL query strings or database connection information, allowing the Hyperlambda code to interact with databases or execute SQL commands based on the content of this node.
