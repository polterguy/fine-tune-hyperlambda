// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of nodes within a specific path to a concatenated string. It uses [set-name] to target nodes under [data.read] and [columns], appending "distinct(" and the value of [distinct_column] from [.arguments], followed by a closing parenthesis. The [strings.concat] slot is used to build the new name by combining these parts.
