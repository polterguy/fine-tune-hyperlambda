/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda) of its previous result set. It is useful when you need to access the next node in sequence relative to a given node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is useful for accessing all direct children of a node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator again retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. This allows for deeper traversal into the node hierarchy.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - The third `*` iterator continues to retrieve all children nodes of its previous result set, allowing for even further traversal into the node hierarchy.
 * 
 * 5. `content` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "content". It is useful when you need to specifically target nodes named "content" within a hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to navigate through a complex node structure to find and process content nodes that are deeply nested within a hierarchy.
 * - It can be applied in scenarios where content extraction from a structured document or data set is required, especially when the content is not directly accessible from the root or current node.
