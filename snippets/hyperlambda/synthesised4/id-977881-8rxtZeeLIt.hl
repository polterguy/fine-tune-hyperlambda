// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [yield] slot to return a value from a dynamic slot or a Hyperlambda file execution. It uses the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate strings and assigns the result to a node named [name]. The [yield] slot then returns this [name] node, effectively outputting the concatenated string as the result of the Hyperlambda execution.
