/*
 * 1. `@.exe` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "exe" from the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name that may not be a direct child of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "exe" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "exe" node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to only include those with the name "signal". It is used to narrow down the node set to specific nodes of interest, in this case, nodes named "signal".
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include scenarios where you need to process or evaluate all "signal" nodes that are children of an "exe" node. For example, it could be used in a system that manages execution signals or commands, where each "signal" node represents a specific action or event to be handled.
