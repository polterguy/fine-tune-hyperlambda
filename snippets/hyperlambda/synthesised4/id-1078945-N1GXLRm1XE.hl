/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by selecting the first node named `.arguments` in the current hierarchy. This node is typically used to define the arguments or parameters passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda. It acts as the starting point for further traversal.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument or parameter that is defined within the `.arguments` node. This is useful for iterating over or processing each argument individually.
 * 
 * 3. `from`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `from`. It is used to specifically target and retrieve the node named `from` within the children of the `.arguments` node. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate a specific argument named `from`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to retrieve the value of a specific argument named `from` that was passed to the function. It is useful in scenarios where you need to perform operations or logic based on the value of this particular argument.
 * - It can be used in validation or conditional logic to check if the `from` argument is present and has a specific value before proceeding with further processing.
