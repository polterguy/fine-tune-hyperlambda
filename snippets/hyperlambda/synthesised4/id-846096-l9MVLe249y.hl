// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.greeting] node to the first non-null value obtained from evaluating the [get-first-value] slot. It first attempts to retrieve a value from the [data.read] node's children using [get-value], and if no value is found, it defaults to the static string "Hello there! How may I help you today?". The [set-value] slot is used to assign this result to [.greeting].
set-value:x:@.greeting
   get-first-value
      get-value:x:@data.read/*/*/greeting
      .:Hello there! How may I help you today?
