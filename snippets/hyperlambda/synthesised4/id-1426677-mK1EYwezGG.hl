/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and extract the type of error from a specific node in the hierarchy. The expression navigates through a series of nodes to find the [.type] node within a [.onerror] node, which is a child of a [magic.ai.crawl-site] signal. This is useful for handling or logging specific error types in a structured way.
 * // 1. [unwrap] - This slot is used to evaluate and extract the value of the specified node.
 * // 2. [x:./*/signal/=magic.ai.crawl-site/*/.onerror/*/.type] - This expression navigates through the node hierarchy to find the [.type] node within a [.onerror] node, under a [magic.ai.crawl-site] signal.
