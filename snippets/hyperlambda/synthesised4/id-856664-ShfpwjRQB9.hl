// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. It sets the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.dp/#/*/embedding_vss] to false. The [else] slot is executed only if all preceding conditional slots (like [if] or [else-if]) evaluate to false, making it a fallback or default action. The [set-value] slot is used to change the value of the specified node.
