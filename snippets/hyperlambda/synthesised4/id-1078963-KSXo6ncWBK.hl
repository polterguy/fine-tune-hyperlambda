/*
 * 1. `@.disallow` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named "disallow" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that it starts from the current node's context. This is useful for locating a specific node within the current hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "disallow" node. The `*` symbol is used to access all direct child nodes of the specified parent node. This is useful when you want to perform operations on all children of a specific node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve all child nodes of a node named "disallow" within a certain context. It could be useful in scenarios where you need to apply certain rules or restrictions defined under the "disallow" node to its children, such as in access control or configuration settings.
