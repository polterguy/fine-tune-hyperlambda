 *  * This Hyperlambda code snippet modifies the value of a node by concatenating its current value with a new line character.
 *  * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node specified by the expression.
 *  * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 *  * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the current value of the node specified by the expression.
 *  * 4. [.] - Represents a static value, in this case, a new line character.
