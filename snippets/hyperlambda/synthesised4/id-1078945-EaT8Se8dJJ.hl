/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which indicates that it will search for the first node with the name "result" within the current scope or hierarchy. The `@` symbol is used to find nodes by name, and in this case, it specifically looks for a node named "result". This is useful when you need to access or manipulate the value of a node named "result" within the current context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the value of a node named "result" to use it in further computations or logic.
 * - Checking if a node named "result" exists in the current scope to determine the outcome of previous operations.
