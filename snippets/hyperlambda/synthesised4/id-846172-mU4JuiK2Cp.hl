// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [eq] slot to check if the value of the "pk" node, obtained through a lambda expression, is equal to the long integer 1. The [eq] slot compares two values and returns true if they are exactly the same. The expression `x:@.dp/#/*/pk` navigates through the node structure to locate the "pk" node's value for comparison.
eq:x:@.dp/#/*/pk
