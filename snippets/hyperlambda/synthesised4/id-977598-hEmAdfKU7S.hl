// This Hyperlambda code checks if the values of two nodes, [.foo1] and [.foo2], are both equal to "OK". If both conditions are true, it sets the value of the [.result] node to "MATCH". The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, with [and] ensuring both conditions must be true, and [eq] checking for equality. The [.lambda] node contains the action to be executed if the conditions are met.
