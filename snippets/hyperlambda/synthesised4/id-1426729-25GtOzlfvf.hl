/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to concatenate a string stored in a [.prompt] node with the text content of a specific node in a Hyperlambda structure, separated by " | ". It uses [strings.concat] to perform the concatenation and [get-value] to retrieve the values of the nodes. The result is stored in a [.tmp-prompt] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [case] - This node is likely a part of a switch-case construct, though its specific role isn't clear from the snippet alone.
 * 2. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.tmp-prompt] node.
 * 3. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 4. [get-value:x:@.prompt] - Retrieves the value of the [.prompt] node.
 * 5. [.] - Represents a static string value, in this case, " | ".
 * 6. [get-value:x:"@.dp/#/*/\\#text"] - Retrieves the text content of a specific node in the Hyperlambda structure.
