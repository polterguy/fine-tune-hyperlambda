 * The code checks if a specific node does not exist within the first child of the [file-data] node, using a dynamic expression to determine the node's name based on the [completion] argument. If the node is absent, the [not-exists] slot evaluates to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [not-exists] - Evaluates to true if the specified expression yields zero results, checking for the absence of a node.
 * 2. [@.file-data/0/*/\"{@.arguments/*/completion}\""] - A dynamic expression that navigates to the first child of [file-data] and checks for a node with a name derived from the [completion] argument.
