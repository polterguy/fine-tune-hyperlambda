// The Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and forward the expressions found in the [message] node, which is a child of the [args] node. This process ensures that the expressions are evaluated before the node where [unwrap] is referenced is reached, allowing for dynamic content to be resolved and used in subsequent operations.
