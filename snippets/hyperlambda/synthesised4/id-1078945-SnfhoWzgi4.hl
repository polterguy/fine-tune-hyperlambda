/*
 * - `@.new-prompt`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node named "new-prompt" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to directly access a specific node by its name, especially if you know the node's name and it is located in the current context or hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve and manipulate the value or children of a node named "new-prompt" within a larger Hyperlambda structure, such as when you want to check or modify its contents in a conditional statement or a loop.
