/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of its previous result set. It moves to the next node below the current node in the Hyperlambda hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access the next node in a sequence or list.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing for operations or evaluations on each child node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - The second `*` again retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it is used to further drill down into the hierarchy, accessing the children of the children retrieved by the first `*`.
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression might include navigating through a structured data set where you need to access and potentially manipulate or evaluate nodes at a specific level of the hierarchy, starting from the elder sibling of a given node. This could be useful in scenarios where the structure of the data is consistent, and operations need to be performed on nodes that are two levels deep from a starting point.
