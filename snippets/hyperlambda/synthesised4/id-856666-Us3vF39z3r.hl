/*
 * The code uses the [remove-nodes] slot to delete specific nodes within a Hyperlambda structure. It targets nodes under [data.connect], specifically within [data.read], [where], [and], and [or] nodes, effectively cleaning up or restructuring the node hierarchy by removing these elements. 
 * 
 * 1. [remove-nodes] - Removes nodes specified by the expression.
 * 2. [data.connect] - The root node where the removal operation begins.
 * 3. [data.read] - A child node under [data.connect] where further traversal occurs.
 * 4. [where] - A node under [data.read] that contains conditions.
 * 5. [and] - A logical operator node under [where] that groups conditions.
 * 6. [or] - A logical operator node under [and] that is targeted for removal.
