// The **[unwrap]** slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, it evaluates all descendant nodes of the **[signal]** node, applying any expressions found, and effectively transforming them into their static value equivalents. This allows for pre-evaluation of expressions, ensuring that any dynamic content is resolved before further processing.
