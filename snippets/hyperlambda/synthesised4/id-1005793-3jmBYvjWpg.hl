/*
 * 1. `..`: This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is useful when you need to access nodes from the top level of your Hyperlambda structure, regardless of your current position in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it will retrieve all children of the root node. This is useful when you want to perform operations on all direct descendants of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `.foo1`: This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "foo1" from the previous result set. In this case, it filters the children of the root node to find nodes specifically named "foo1". This is helpful when you need to target specific nodes by name within a broader set of nodes.
