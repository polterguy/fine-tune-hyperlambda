// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of a node referenced by [.x] to a concatenated string. It uses [strings.concat] to combine an "@" symbol, the value of [.node-name], "/*/", and the name of the node currently iterated by [for-each] through [.dp]. The slots involved are: [set-value] to change the node's value, [strings.concat] to concatenate strings, [get-value] to retrieve the value of [.node-name], and [get-name] to retrieve the name of the current node in the iteration.
