/*
 * 1. `@.result` - This iterator searches for the first node named "result" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy to find the first occurrence of a node with this name. This is useful for accessing a specific node that might be a sibling or an ancestor in the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator. In this context, it will get all child nodes of the "result" node. This is useful when you want to process or evaluate all children nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `finish_reason` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "finish_reason". It will return all nodes named "finish_reason" that are children of the "result" node. This is useful for accessing specific data or attributes within a structured data set, such as retrieving the reason for completion in a task or process.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting the reason for the completion of a task or process from a result node in a workflow or data processing pipeline.
 * - Analyzing the outcomes of operations where the "finish_reason" provides context or explanation for the result.
