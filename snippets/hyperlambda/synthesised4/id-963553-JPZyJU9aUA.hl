// The [signal] slot in Hyperlambda is used to invoke a previously created dynamic slot. It allows for the execution of a specific slot by name, enabling modular and loosely coupled code execution. The slot name is specified as the value of the [signal] node, and upon execution, it will run the logic defined in the corresponding dynamic slot. This mechanism is part of the Magic Signals framework, which facilitates communication between different parts of an application without direct references.
