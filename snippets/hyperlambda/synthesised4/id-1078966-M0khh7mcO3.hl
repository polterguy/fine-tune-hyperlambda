 * 1. `@.urls`: This iterator searches for the first node named "urls" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node's siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate data associated with a specific node name within the current scope or its ancestors. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a list of URLs stored in a node named "urls" for further processing or validation.
 * - Accessing configuration settings or resources identified by the "urls" node in a hierarchical data structure.
