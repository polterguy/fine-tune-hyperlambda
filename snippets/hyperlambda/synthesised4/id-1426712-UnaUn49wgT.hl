/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [model] node within the [.arguments] node is equal to "o3-mini". If the condition is true, it performs two actions: it renames the [max_tokens] node within the [payload] node of an [http.post] request to [max_completion_tokens], and it removes the [temperature] node from the same [payload] node. The code is used to conditionally modify the structure of an HTTP request payload based on the model type. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if a condition is true.
 * 2. [eq] - Compares the value of the [model] node to "o3-mini".
 * 3. [.lambda] - Executes the following nodes if the condition is true.
 * 4. [set-name] - Renames the [max_tokens] node to [max_completion_tokens].
 * 5. [remove-nodes] - Removes the [temperature] node from the [payload].
