// This Hyperlambda code snippet evaluates a logical condition using the [or] slot. It checks if either of the following conditions is true: 1) the [stream] node does not exist within the [.arguments] node, or 2) the value of the [stream] node within [.arguments] is equal to false. If either condition is true, the [or] slot will evaluate to true. The code is useful for scenarios where you want to execute a block of code if a stream is either absent or explicitly set to false.
