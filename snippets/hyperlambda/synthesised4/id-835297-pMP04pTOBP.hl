/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [Type] node is either "tinyint(1)", "bool", or "boolean" using the [eq] slot within an [or] condition. If any of these conditions are true, it sets the value of the [.type] node to "bool". The [if] slot is used to evaluate the logical condition, and the [.lambda] slot contains the action to be executed if the condition is met. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional check.
 * 2. [or] - Evaluates to true if any of its child conditions are true.
 * 3. [eq] - Compares the value of the [Type] node to "tinyint(1)", "bool", or "boolean".
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [Type] node.
 * 5. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the [or] condition is true.
 * 6. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.type] node to "bool".
