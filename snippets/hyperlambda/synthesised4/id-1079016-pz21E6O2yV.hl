/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It's typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or a slot, especially in the context of HTTP endpoints or dynamic slots.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed into the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the children nodes of "arguments" to find the first node named "session". It is used to specifically access the "session" argument, which might contain session-related data or identifiers.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to access session information passed as an argument to a Hyperlambda slot or an HTTP endpoint. For example, it could be used to retrieve a session ID or session-related data to manage user sessions in a web application.
