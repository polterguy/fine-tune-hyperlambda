/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [neq] slot to check if the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.arguments/*/search_postfix] is not equal to an empty string. If the value is not equal to an empty string, the [neq] slot will evaluate to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [neq] - Compares two values and evaluates to true if they are not equal.
 * 2. [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/search_postfix] - Retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression.
 * 3. [.:] - Represents an empty string for comparison.
