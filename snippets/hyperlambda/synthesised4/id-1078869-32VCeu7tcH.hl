/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "dp" in the current context. It is often used to access a specific node that is expected to be present in the data structure, such as a node passed by reference in a [for-each] loop.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the "dp" node is itself a node, allowing you to work with the original node rather than a copy. This is useful when you need to modify or access the properties of the node directly.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node found by the previous iterator. It is used when you want to access all nodes that are direct descendants of the current node, allowing for operations on multiple nodes at once.
 * 
 * 4. `value` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "value". It is used to pinpoint specific nodes among the children, often to extract or manipulate their values.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used in a scenario where you are iterating over a collection of nodes and need to access or modify the "value" of each node in the collection. For example, in a data processing task where each node represents an item with a "value" property that needs to be aggregated or transformed.
 * - Another use case could be in a configuration or settings management system, where you need to retrieve the "value" of specific settings nodes for further processing or validation.
