// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each child node of [data.read], modifying the nodes within each iteration. It changes the names of nodes under [add] to match the [type] value of the current node and sets their values to the [value] of the current node. Additionally, it appends an empty node structure to [extra]. The code utilizes the [for-each] slot to loop through nodes, [set-name] to rename nodes, [set-value] to update node values, and [add] to append nodes.
