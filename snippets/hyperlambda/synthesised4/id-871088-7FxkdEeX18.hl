// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to convert a lambda object into a JSON string and assign it to a node. The [set-value] slot changes the value of the [.json] node to the result of the [lambda2json] slot, which takes as input the lambda object referenced by the [execute] node. The [lambda2json] slot is used to transform the lambda object into a JSON string format.
set-value:x:@.json
   lambda2json:x:@execute/*
