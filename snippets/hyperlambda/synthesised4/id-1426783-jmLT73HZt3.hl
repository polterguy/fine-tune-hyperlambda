/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sends a signal to a specific session using the [sockets.signal] slot, with an argument indicating that a process is finished. It then sets the value of the [iterations] node to 0 using the [set-value] slot. 
 * 
 * 1. [else] - This is the default else statement that executes if previous conditions are false.
 * 2. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to a specific session.
 * 3. [args] - Arguments to be sent with the signal, in this case, indicating that a process is finished.
 * 4. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [iterations] node.
 * 5. [.] - Represents the static value to be set, in this case, an integer 0.
