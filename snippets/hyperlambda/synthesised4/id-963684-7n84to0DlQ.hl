// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [fork] slot to execute a lambda object in a separate thread. It logs a message indicating the start of a task, sleeps for 1 second (1000 milliseconds), and then logs another message indicating the completion of the task. The [fork] slot allows the task to run independently of the main thread, enabling concurrent execution without blocking the main execution flow.
fork
   log.info:Logging task 2 started
   sleep:1000
   log.info:Logging task 2 completed
