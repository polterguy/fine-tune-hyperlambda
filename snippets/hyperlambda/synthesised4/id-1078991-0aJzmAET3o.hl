/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to access the arguments node, which is typically the root node for parameters passed into a Hyperlambda file or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any parameters or arguments that are passed into the Hyperlambda execution context.
 * 
 * 3. `pkType` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "pkType". It is used to specifically access the "pkType" argument within the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to access the value of a specific argument named "pkType" that has been passed into a Hyperlambda execution context. This could be used, for example, to determine the type of a primary key in a database operation or to customize behavior based on the type of a key provided to a function or endpoint.
