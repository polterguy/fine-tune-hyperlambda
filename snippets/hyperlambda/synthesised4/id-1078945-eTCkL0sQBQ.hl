/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is commonly used to access the arguments node in Hyperlambda, especially in the context of HTTP endpoints or dynamic slot invocations where arguments are passed.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is useful for accessing all the arguments passed to a function or endpoint, allowing you to iterate over them or access specific ones.
 * 
 * 3. `references` - This iterator filters the result to only include nodes named `references` from the previous result set. It is used to specifically target nodes that are meant to hold reference data, which could be identifiers or pointers to other data structures.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a specific argument named `references` passed to an HTTP endpoint to process or validate reference data.
 * - Iterating over reference nodes in a dynamic slot to perform operations like validation, transformation, or aggregation on the referenced data.
