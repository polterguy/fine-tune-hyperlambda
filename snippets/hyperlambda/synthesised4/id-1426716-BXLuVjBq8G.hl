/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code throws an exception with a specific error message "Malformatted function invocation". The exception is configured to have an HTTP status code of 400, indicating a "Bad Request". The [public] node is set to true, meaning the exception message will be propagated to the client, even in release builds, if no [.catch] block handles it before it reaches the client. This setup is useful for signaling errors in a way that the client can understand and respond to appropriately.
 * // 1. [throw] - Throws an exception with a specified message.
 * // 2. [status] - Sets the HTTP status code for the exception.
 * // 3. [public] - Determines if the exception message should be visible to the client.
