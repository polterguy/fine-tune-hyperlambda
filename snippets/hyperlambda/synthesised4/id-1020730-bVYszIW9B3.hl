/*
 * 1. `@cache` - This iterator searches for the first node in the current scope with the name "cache". It is useful when you need to access or manipulate data stored in a node named "cache", which might be used for caching purposes in your application.
 * 
 * 2. `try-get` - This is not a separate iterator but rather a continuation of the node name being searched. It implies that the node being accessed is specifically named "cache.try-get". This could be a node that attempts to retrieve a value from a cache, possibly returning a default value or indicating a cache miss if the item is not found.
