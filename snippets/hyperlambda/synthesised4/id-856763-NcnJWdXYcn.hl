It concatenates various strings and values retrieved from arguments and context, forming a structured text format with sections labeled "QUESTION," "CONTEXT," and "ANSWER." The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine these elements into a single string. The [get-value] slot retrieves values from specified nodes to be included in the concatenation.
