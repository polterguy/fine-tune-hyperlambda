/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [get-count] slot to count the number of child nodes under the [.data] node. The result is the total number of nodes directly under [.data]. 
 * 
 * 1. [.data] - Declares a node with children nodes to be counted.
 * 2. [get-count] - Counts the number of child nodes under [.data].
