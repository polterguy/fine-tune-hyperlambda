/*
 * 1. `@signal`: This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by its name, starting from the current node and traversing upwards if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the node found by the previous iterator.
 * 
 * 3. `sitemap`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "sitemap" among the children of the "signal" node. It is used to pinpoint a specific node by name within the children of the previously selected node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access or manipulate a "sitemap" node that is a child of a "signal" node, possibly to update or read its contents.
 * - It could be used in a web application to dynamically generate or modify a sitemap based on signals or events captured in the application.
