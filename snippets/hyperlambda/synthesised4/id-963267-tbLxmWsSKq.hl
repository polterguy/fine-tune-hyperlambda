// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [if] slot with an expression. It checks if the value of the [foo] node within the [.arguments] node is true. If the condition evaluates to true, it sets the value of the [dest] node to "yup!". The [set-value] slot is used to modify the [dest] node's value based on the condition.
if:x:@.arguments/*/foo
   set-value:x:@.dest
      .:yup!
