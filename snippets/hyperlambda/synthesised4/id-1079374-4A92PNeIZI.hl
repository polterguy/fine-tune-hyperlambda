/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, and the `.` symbol specifies that the search should start from the current node. If the current node has a child named "sql", it will return that node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve SQL query strings or SQL-related configurations stored within a node named "sql" in the current context.
 * - It could be part of a larger Hyperlambda script that dynamically constructs or executes SQL queries based on the retrieved "sql" node.
