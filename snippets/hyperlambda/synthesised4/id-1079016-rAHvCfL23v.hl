/*
 * 1. `@signal`: This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful for locating a specific node that may not be a direct child of the current node but exists somewhere in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the "signal" node. It is used to access all nodes directly under the "signal" node, regardless of their names. This is helpful when you want to perform operations on or inspect all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `cached`: This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes named "cached" among the children of the "signal" node. It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes with a specific name, allowing for targeted operations or evaluations on these nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * - Retrieving configuration or status information stored in nodes named "cached" that are children of a "signal" node, which might represent a specific signal or event in a system.
 * - Collecting or processing data related to cached signals, such as clearing cache entries or updating cached values.
