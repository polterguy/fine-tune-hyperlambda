// This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQL Server database named "projects" and deletes records from the "projects" table where the "status" field is equal to "archived". The [mssql.connect] slot establishes the database connection, while the [mssql.delete] slot specifies the table and condition for deletion using a [where] clause with an [and] logical operator.
mssql.connect:projects
   mssql.delete
      table:projects
      where
         and
            status.eq:archived
