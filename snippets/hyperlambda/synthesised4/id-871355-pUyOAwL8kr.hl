// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL read operation using a SQLite database. It specifies a left join between the "EmployeeTerritories" and "Employees" tables, using "EmployeeID" as the alias for the join. The code selects distinct columns using a functor, and includes a placeholder for additional conditions in the "where" clause. Key slots include [data.read] for initiating the read operation, [join] for specifying the join type and conditions, [columns] for selecting specific columns, and [where] for filtering results.
