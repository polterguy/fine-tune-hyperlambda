/*
 * This Hyperlambda code retrieves all children nodes of the node referenced by the [.dp] node. The [.dp] node is typically used within a [for-each] loop or similar constructs to refer to the currently iterated node. The [get-nodes] slot is used to obtain these child nodes, allowing further operations or manipulations on them. 
 * 
 * 1. [get-nodes] - Retrieves the nodes specified by its expression.
 * 2. [x:@.dp/#/*] - Expression that points to all children of the node referenced by [.dp].
