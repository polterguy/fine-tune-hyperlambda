// The Hyperlambda code retrieves data from the "cloudlets" table, counting the total number of entries and aliasing the result as "count". It applies a "where" condition with an "and" logical operator, and limits the result to one record. The [limit] slot is explicitly set to 1, ensuring only a single result is returned.
