/*
 * 1. `@.finish_reason`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `finish_reason` that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. It uses the `@` symbol to denote that it is searching for a node by name. This is useful in scenarios where you need to access a specific node that is not a direct child of the current node, but is somewhere in the hierarchy above or at the same level. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the reason for the completion of a process or task, which might be stored in a node named `finish_reason`.
 * - Accessing metadata or status information that is stored in a sibling or ancestor node named `finish_reason`.
