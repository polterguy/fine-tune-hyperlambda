/*
 * This Hyperlambda code appends a newline character to the existing value of the [.completion] node. It uses the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate a newline character with the current value of [.completion], which is retrieved using [get-value]. The result is then set back to the [.completion] node using [set-value]. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.completion] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates strings, in this case, a newline character and the current value of [.completion].
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the current value of the [.completion] node.
