// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced, allowing for forward evaluation. In this example, [unwrap] evaluates the expression "x:+/*/*" before the instruction pointer reaches the node, effectively unwrapping the specified nodes and their children.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
