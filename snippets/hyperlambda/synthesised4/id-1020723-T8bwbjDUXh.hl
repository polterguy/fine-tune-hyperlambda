/*
 * 1. `@data` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "data" in the current context. It is useful when you need to access or manipulate a specific node by its name within the current hierarchy or scope.
 * 2. `delete` - This is not an iterator but rather a continuation of the expression that implies an action or operation related to the "data" node. In this context, it suggests that the expression is targeting a "delete" operation or node associated with "data". This could be used to delete data or perform some cleanup operation related to the "data" node.
