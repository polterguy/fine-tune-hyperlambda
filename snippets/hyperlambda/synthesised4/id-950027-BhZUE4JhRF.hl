// The code iterates through each child node of [.data] using [for-each], comparing the value of each node to a minimum value stored in [.min] using [lt]. If a node's value is less than [.min], it updates [.min] with the new lower value using [set-value]. This effectively finds the smallest value among the child nodes of [.data].
