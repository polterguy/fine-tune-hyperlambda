// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] slot in Hyperlambda to evaluate multiple conditions. Here, it checks if the [id] node is equal to the integer value 42 using the [eq] slot. The [and] slot ensures that all its child conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true.
