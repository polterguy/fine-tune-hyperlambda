// The code uses a [switch] statement to evaluate the value of a node referenced by the expression [@.value]. It checks against three [case] options: "small", "medium", and "large", returning a corresponding message for each. If none of these cases match, the [default] case sets a [.result] node with the value "Unknown size". The [switch] structure allows for conditional branching based on the value of [@.value].
switch:x:@.value
   case:small
      return:Size is small
   case:medium
      return:Size is medium
   case:large
      return:Size is large
   default
      .result:Unknown size
