// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to determine the Hyperlambda type of a given value. In this example, a node with a decimal value is defined, and the [type] slot is used to retrieve the type name of this value. The [type] slot returns the type name as a string, which in this case would be "decimal". This can be useful for dynamically checking or validating the types of values within a Hyperlambda script.
type:decimal
