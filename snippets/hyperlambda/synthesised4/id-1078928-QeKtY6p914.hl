/*
 * 1. `@openai` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "openai" in the current context. It is useful when you need to locate a specific node by name within the current scope.
 * 
 * 2. `tokenize` - This part of the expression is not an iterator but rather a continuation of the node name from the previous iterator. It implies that the node being searched for is named "openai" with a child node named "tokenize". This is useful when you need to access or manipulate data or functionality associated with the "tokenize" node under the "openai" node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a context where you need to access a specific functionality or data related to tokenization provided by an "openai" node, such as tokenizing text for natural language processing tasks.
