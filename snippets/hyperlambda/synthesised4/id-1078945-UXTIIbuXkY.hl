/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a Hyperlambda slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument individually.
 * 
 * 3. `temperature` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `temperature`. It is used to specifically target the `temperature` argument within the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda slot or endpoint to retrieve the value of a `temperature` argument passed to it. This might be useful in a weather-related application where temperature data is processed or validated.
