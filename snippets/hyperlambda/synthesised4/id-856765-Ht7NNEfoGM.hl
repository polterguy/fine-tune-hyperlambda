// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot, which is part of a [switch] statement. The [case] slot evaluates its value against a given expression, executing its children nodes if the condition is met. This allows for conditional branching based on multiple potential values, similar to a switch-case construct in traditional programming languages.
