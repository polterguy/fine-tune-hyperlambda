// This Hyperlambda code uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.accessLevel] to "Limited access". The [set-value] slot takes an expression pointing to the node whose value should be changed, and a source value, in this case "Limited access", which will be assigned to the node.
set-value:x:@.accessLevel
