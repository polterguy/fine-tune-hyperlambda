// This code snippet adds nodes from a Hyperlambda object to a specified location. It uses the [add] slot to append nodes, retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot from the result of a [hyper2lambda] conversion, to the [.lambda] node within a [whitelist] structure. The [add] slot ensures the nodes are added to the correct location, while [get-nodes] fetches the nodes from the converted Hyperlambda text.
