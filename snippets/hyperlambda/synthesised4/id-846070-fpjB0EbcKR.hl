// The code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of all nodes referenced by the expression [@.page-header/*/h2] to the value obtained from the node referenced by [@.prompt]. The [set-value] slot takes an expression pointing to the target nodes and a source expression or static value to update the target nodes' values. This operation is useful for dynamically updating content in a structured data format.
set-value:x:@.page-header/*/h2
   get-value:x:@.prompt
