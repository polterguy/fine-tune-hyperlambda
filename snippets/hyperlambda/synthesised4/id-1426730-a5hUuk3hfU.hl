// The [unwrap] slot in this code is used to evaluate an expression before the node where it's referenced is reached. It takes an expression as its value, which in this case is "+/*/*", and evaluates it, effectively "unwrapping" the expression. The result of this evaluation is then used as the value of the node where [unwrap] is invoked. This allows for forward evaluation of expressions within a lambda object, enabling dynamic manipulation of node values before execution.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
