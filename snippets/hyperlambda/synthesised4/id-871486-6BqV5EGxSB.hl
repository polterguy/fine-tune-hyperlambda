// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database table named "Doctors" using the [data.read] slot. It specifies the database type as SQLite and selects distinct values from a column named "distinct_functor", aliasing the result as "count". The [where] clause is prepared for additional conditions using the [and] slot, allowing for further filtering of the data.
