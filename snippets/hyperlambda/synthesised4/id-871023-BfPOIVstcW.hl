// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a destination node's children collection. It retrieves nodes specified by the expression in [get-nodes] and adds them to the node referenced by the [add] slot's expression. This allows dynamic modification of the node graph by appending nodes from a specified source to a specified destination.
