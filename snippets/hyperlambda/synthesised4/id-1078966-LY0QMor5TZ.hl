/*
 * 1. `@.snippets` - This iterator searches for the first node named "snippets" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It's useful for locating a specific node when you know its name but not its exact location in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "snippets" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "snippets" node, which can be useful when you want to process or iterate over all items contained within a parent node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used to collect all code snippets stored under a "snippets" node, which might be useful in a code editor or a documentation tool where you need to list or manipulate all available code snippets.
 * - It could also be used in a configuration management system to retrieve all configuration items or settings grouped under a "snippets" node for processing or validation.
