// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using the [data.read] slot, specifically targeting an SQLite database. The query is structured to select data from the "Regions" table. The [columns] node specifies that an aggregate function, represented by [aggregate_functor], should be applied, and its result should be aliased as "result". The [where] node is included, but it is not fully defined in this snippet, indicating that conditions can be added to filter the data. The [group] node specifies that the results should be grouped by the column [group_column]. Finally, the [return-nodes] slot is used to return the results of the [data.read] operation, effectively retrieving all nodes resulting from the query execution. This setup is useful for performing grouped aggregate queries on a specified table in an SQLite database.
