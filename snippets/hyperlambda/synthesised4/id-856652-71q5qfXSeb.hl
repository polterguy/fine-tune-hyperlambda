// The code retrieves the value of a node specified by a complex lambda expression. It uses [get-value] to access the value of a node that is a descendant of the node referenced by [.dp], traversing through its children and a specific path. This is useful for accessing deeply nested node values in a Hyperlambda graph structure.
