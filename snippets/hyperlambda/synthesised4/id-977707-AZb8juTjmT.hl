/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes from a source to a destination. The [add] slot targets the children of the [.envs] node, and the [get-nodes] slot retrieves nodes from the [.shared-config] node. The retrieved nodes are then added to the [.envs] node's children, effectively merging the configurations from [.shared-config] into [.envs]. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified destination node's children.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the specified source node.
