/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "signal" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by its name, starting from the current node and moving upwards or sideways in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously matched node set. In this context, it will get all children of the "signal" node.
 * 
 * 3. `snippets` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved node set to only include nodes with the name "snippets". It is used to narrow down the node set to specific nodes of interest.
 * 
 * 4. `0` - This iterator retrieves the first child node of the previously matched node set. It is used to select a specific node when multiple nodes are present.
 * 
 * 5. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously matched node set. It will get all children of the first "snippets" node.
 * 
 * 6. `prompt` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved node set to only include nodes with the name "prompt". It is used to find a specific node that contains the desired data.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to extract a specific "prompt" node from a structured data set where prompts are organized under a "signal" node, which contains multiple "snippets". This might be useful in applications where you need to dynamically retrieve and process prompt data for AI or machine learning tasks.
