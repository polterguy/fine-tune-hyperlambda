/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [case] slot to set the value of the [.type] node to "bool". The [set-value] slot is used to assign the value, and the [case] slot is typically part of a [switch] statement, allowing for conditional logic based on different cases. 
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Represents a case in a switch statement, typically used for conditional branching.
 * 2. [set-value] - Assigns the value "bool" to the [.type] node.
