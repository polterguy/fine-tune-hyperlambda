// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [get-first-value] slot to return the first non-null value among its children nodes or expressions. It sequentially evaluates the value of the [title] node, then the [description] node, and finally defaults to the static value "Page" if both are null. This is useful for setting default values when multiple potential sources might be null.
