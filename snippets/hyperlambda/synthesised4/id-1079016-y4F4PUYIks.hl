/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by finding the first node named [.arguments] in the current hierarchy. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. This is useful for iterating over all arguments provided to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `type`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name [type] among the children of [.arguments]. This is often used to access a specific argument's type information.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve the type information of arguments passed to a Hyperlambda function or endpoint, which can be useful for validation or processing logic based on the argument types.
