// The code snippet uses the [validators.default] slot to ensure that a node named [randomize] exists within the [.arguments] node collection. If the [randomize] node does not exist, it is appended with a default integer value of 0. If the node exists but has a null value, its value is set to 0. This ensures that the [randomize] node always has a valid integer value within the specified context.
