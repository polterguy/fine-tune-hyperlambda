// The code snippet adds nodes to a collection of Hyperlambda files. It uses the [add] slot to append a node to the [.hl-files] node. The node being added is a reference to the current node being iterated by [.dp], which is passed by reference. This allows dynamic manipulation of a node set, appending nodes to an existing collection.
