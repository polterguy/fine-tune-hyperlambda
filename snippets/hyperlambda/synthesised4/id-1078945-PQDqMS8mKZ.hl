/*
 * 1. `@.extra-tokens`: This iterator begins with the `@` symbol, which indicates that it will search for the first node with the name "extra-tokens" in the current context. The `.` following the `@` specifies that the search should start from the current node's parent. This means it will look for a sibling node named "extra-tokens" at the same level as the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to retrieve or manipulate a node named "extra-tokens" that is a sibling to the current node. For example, in a token management system, you might use this expression to access additional tokens associated with a user or process.
