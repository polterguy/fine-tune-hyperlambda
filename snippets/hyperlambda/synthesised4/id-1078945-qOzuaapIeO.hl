/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves downwards in the Hyperlambda hierarchy to the next node. This is useful when you want to access a node that is directly below the current node in the same level of hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access every child node under the current node, allowing you to perform operations or gather data from all direct descendants.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set, which in this case are the children of the nodes retrieved by the first `*`. This allows you to access a deeper level of the hierarchy, specifically the grandchildren of the original node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to traverse a structured data hierarchy where you need to access and possibly manipulate or analyze the grandchildren nodes of the elder sibling of the current node. For example, in a configuration file or a data processing task, you might need to apply certain operations to all sub-elements of a specific node's sibling.
