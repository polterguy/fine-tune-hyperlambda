/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you want to navigate up one level in the node hierarchy to access sibling nodes or the parent node's properties.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it will retrieve all children of the parent node identified by the previous `.` iterator. This is useful for iterating over or accessing all child nodes of a specific parent.
 * 
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "signal". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes that are specifically named "signal" among the children of the parent node.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Similar to the previous `*` iterator, this retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" nodes. This allows further navigation into the hierarchy, accessing any nodes that are children of "signal" nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `.callback` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name ".callback". It is used to specifically target nodes named ".callback" that are children of the "signal" nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to find and process callback functions associated with signal nodes in a hierarchical data structure. For example, in an event-driven system, you might use this expression to locate and execute callback functions that should be triggered in response to certain signals.
