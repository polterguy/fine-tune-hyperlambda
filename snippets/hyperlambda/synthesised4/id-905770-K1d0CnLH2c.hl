// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to set the value of the [.roles] node. It achieves this by joining all roles specified as children of the [roles] node within the [.arguments] node, using a comma as a separator. The [strings.join] slot is used to concatenate these role names into a single string, which is then assigned to the [.roles] node.
