// The code uses [strings.concat] to concatenate a series of strings, including a dynamic value retrieved from the [get-value] slot, into a single string. The concatenation includes a static string "[generic|" and a closing bracket "]", with the dynamic part being the value of the [database] node within the [.arguments] node. This results in a string that combines both static and dynamic content.
