// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of a [title] node from an HTTP GET request's response and assigns it to a local [title] node. The [set-value] slot changes the value of the [title] node referenced in its expression to the result of the [get-value] slot, which extracts the title from the HTTP response content.
set-value:x:@.title
