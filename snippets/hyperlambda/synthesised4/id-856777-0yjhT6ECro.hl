// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database using the [data.connect] slot with the connection string "generic" and database name "magic". It then executes a SQL command with [data.execute] to delete records from two tables, "vss_ml_training_snippets" and "ml_training_snippets", based on the conditions specified by the "type" and "uri" arguments. The "type" is fetched from the [.arguments] node, and "uri" is fetched from the [.uri] node.

   data.execute:"\ndelete from vss_ml_training_snippets\nwhere rowid in (select id as rowid from ml_training_snippets where type = @type and uri like @uri);\ndelete from ml_training_snippets where type = @type and uri like @uri;"
