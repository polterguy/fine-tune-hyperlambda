// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database table named "Regions". It specifies the use of a "distinct_functor" as a column, aliasing it as "count", and includes a [where] clause with an [and] condition for filtering results. The [database-type] is set to "sqlite", indicating the type of database being accessed.
