/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of its previous result set. It starts the expression by moving to the next node below the current context in the Hyperlambda structure.
 *    
 * 2. `*` - The first `*` retrieves all children nodes of the current node (the elder sibling node identified by the `+` iterator). This expands the search to include all immediate children of the elder sibling node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - The second `*` retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set, which are the children of the nodes identified by the first `*`. This effectively goes two levels deep into the hierarchy of the elder sibling node.
 * 
 * 4. `.sse` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `.sse`. It narrows down the search to nodes with this specific name among the previously retrieved nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `*` - This `*` retrieves all children nodes of the `.sse` nodes identified in the previous step. It further explores the hierarchy by including all immediate children of the `.sse` nodes.
 * 
 * 6. `.session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `.session`. It finalizes the search by narrowing it down to nodes with this specific name among the children of the `.sse` nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to navigate a complex data structure where you need to find session-related information stored under a specific sibling node and its descendants. 
 * - It might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze session data that is organized under a specific part of a larger data structure, such as in a web application managing user sessions.
