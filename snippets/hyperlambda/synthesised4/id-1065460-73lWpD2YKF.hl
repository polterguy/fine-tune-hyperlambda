/*
 * 1. `@.fields` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "fields" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a match. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name that is not necessarily a direct child of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "fields" node. It is useful when you want to perform operations on or access data from all the child nodes of a specific parent node.
