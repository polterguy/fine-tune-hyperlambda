/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by selecting the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all the children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument individually, regardless of their specific names.
 * 
 * 3. `aggregate_column`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [aggregate_column] among the children of the [.arguments] node. It is used to specifically target and retrieve the node that holds the value for the "aggregate_column" argument, which might be used for operations like aggregation in a database query or similar tasks.
