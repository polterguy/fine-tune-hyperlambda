// The code snippet uses the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot to a specific location in the node graph. It targets the children of the [where] node within a [data.read] structure, adding nodes obtained from the [.arguments] node. The [get-nodes] slot fetches all nodes under [.arguments], which are then added to the specified location. This operation effectively merges argument nodes into the [where] clause of a data reading operation.
