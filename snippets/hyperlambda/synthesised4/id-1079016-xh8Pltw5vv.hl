/*
 * 1. `@.tmp-completion`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node named "tmp-completion" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and traversing upwards through the hierarchy if necessary. This iterator is useful when you need to access a specific node by name that may not be a direct child of the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to retrieve or manipulate data specifically associated with a node named "tmp-completion", such as temporary data or results that are generated during the execution of a process.
