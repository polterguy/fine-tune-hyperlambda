/*
 * The code retrieves nodes that match a specific expression path. It uses the [get-nodes] slot to access nodes under [.arguments] that are children of [ml_training_snippets] and have the name [prompt] with a child node named [eq]. This is useful for extracting specific nodes from a larger structure based on their hierarchical path and names.
 * 
 * 1. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes based on the expression provided.
 * 2. [@.arguments/*/ml_training_snippets.prompt.eq] - Expression path to locate specific nodes within the hierarchy.
