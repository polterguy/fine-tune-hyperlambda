/*
 * The [cache.count] slot in Hyperlambda is used to return the number of items currently stored in the cache. This slot is useful for determining the size of your cache at any given time. In the example provided, a new cache entry is created with a key and an expiration time, and then [cache.count] is invoked to count the total number of cache items. 
 * 
 * 1. [cache.set] - Adds a new item to the cache with a specified key, expiration time, and value.
 * 2. [cache.count] - Returns the total number of items currently stored in the cache.
