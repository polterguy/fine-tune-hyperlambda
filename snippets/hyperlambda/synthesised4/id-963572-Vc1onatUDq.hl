// The code demonstrates the use of the [try] slot in Hyperlambda to handle exceptions. Inside the [try] block, an exception is thrown using the [throw] slot with the value "foo". The [eval] slot is then used to execute the [.eval] node, which contains the [throw] operation. This setup allows for structured error handling by attempting to execute code that may raise an exception.
try
   .eval
      throw:foo
   eval:x:@.eval
