/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. In the context of Hyperlambda, an elder sibling is the node that comes immediately after the current node in the same hierarchical level. This iterator is useful when you want to access or manipulate the node that is directly below the current node in the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `+` - This second `+` iterator again retrieves the elder sibling of the node returned by the first `+` iterator. This effectively allows you to move two nodes downwards in the same hierarchical level from the starting node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in scenarios where you need to access or modify a node that is two positions below the current node within the same level of hierarchy. For example, if you have a list of operations or settings and you want to apply a change to the third operation or setting in the list, starting from the first one.
