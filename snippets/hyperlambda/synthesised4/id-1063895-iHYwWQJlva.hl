// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" at the current level or any ancestor level in the hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` symbol specifies that it starts from the current node. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node named "sql" that might be located at the current level or higher up in the hierarchy, allowing you to access its value or children nodes.
