/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current node's context. It's typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access every argument passed into the current context.
 * 
 * 3. `references` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "references" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target nodes that are intended to hold reference data.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a dynamic slot or function to access and process a list of reference arguments passed to it, perhaps for validation or further processing within a Hyperlambda application.
