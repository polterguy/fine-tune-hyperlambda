/*
 * The code demonstrates how to use the [type] slot in Hyperlambda to declare a node with a specific data type. It shows an example of declaring a node with the name "error" and assigning it a specific type, which can be useful for ensuring data consistency and validation within Hyperlambda scripts. The [type] slot is used to specify the data type of a node's value, allowing for type-safe operations and error checking.
 * 
 * 1. [type] - This slot is used to declare a node with a specific data type.
 * 2. [error] - This is the name of the node being declared with a specific type.
