/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [data] exists within the [.arguments] node, ensures that this [data] node is not null, and verifies that its value is not an empty string. If all these conditions are true, the [and] slot evaluates to true. The code is useful for validating that a required data node is present, has a value, and that the value is not an empty string. 
 * 
 * 1. [exists] - Checks if a node named [data] exists within the [.arguments] node.
 * 2. [not-null] - Ensures that the [data] node is not null.
 * 3. [neq] - Verifies that the value of the [data] node is not an empty string.
