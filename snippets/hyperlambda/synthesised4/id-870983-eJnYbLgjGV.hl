// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [case] slot to add nodes to a dynamic property [.dp]. It adds a [tokens] node with an integer value of 4096 and a [chat] node with a boolean value of true as children to the [.dp] node. The [add] slot is used to append these nodes to the [.dp] node, and the [x:@.dp/#] expression ensures the nodes are added by reference.
