/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "signal" in the current context. It's useful for locating a specific node that acts as a signal or flag within a larger structure.
 * 2. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. It allows for iterating over or processing each child node under "signal".
 * 3. `allow` - This filters the children nodes to only those named "allow". It's useful for finding nodes that represent permissions or access controls within the "signal" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Checking if a specific signal has any "allow" permissions set.
 * - Aggregating or processing all "allow" nodes under a particular signal to determine access rights or permissions.
