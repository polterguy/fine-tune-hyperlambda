// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes into a destination node. It targets all [result] nodes within the [return-nodes] collection and adds a structured set of nodes containing [title], [type], [link], and [snippet] by referencing the current node's properties. The [add] slot is used here to construct a new node structure based on the properties of the current node in the iteration.
