// This Hyperlambda code checks if the [api_key] node exists and is not null, and also ensures that its value is not an empty string. It uses the [and] slot to combine these two conditions, with [not-null] verifying the presence of a non-null [api_key] node, and [neq] confirming that the [api_key] value is not an empty string.
