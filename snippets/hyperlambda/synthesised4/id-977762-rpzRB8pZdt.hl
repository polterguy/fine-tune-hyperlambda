// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [and] slot to combine multiple conditions. It includes a condition that checks the value of [customer_id] within the [.arguments] node. The [and] slot ensures that all specified conditions must be true for the overall expression to evaluate as true. The [customer_id] node is accessed using a lambda expression pointing to its location within the arguments.
