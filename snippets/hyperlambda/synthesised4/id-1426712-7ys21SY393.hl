/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to add nodes from a specific path. It retrieves nodes from the [.exe] node's children with the name [signal] and adds them to the current node. It then sets up two nodes: [result], which gets its value from the [.result] node, and [session], which retrieves its value from the [.arguments] node's [session] child. The code effectively combines results and session data into the current context. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds nodes from the specified path.
 * 2. [result] - Retrieves the value from the [.result] node.
 * 3. [session] - Retrieves the value from the [.arguments] node's [session] child.
