/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the [.corrupt] node is false, and if so, it executes a task named "sqlite.create-backup" to create a backup of the Magic database, and logs a message to the console confirming the execution of the backup task. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional check.
 * 2. [eq] - Compares the value of [.corrupt] to false.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the actions to execute if the condition is true.
 * 4. [tasks.execute] - Executes the "sqlite.create-backup" task.
 * 5. [console.log] - Logs a message indicating the backup task was executed.
