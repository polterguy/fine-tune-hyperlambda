/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet trims the trailing slash ("/") from the value of the [url] node within the [.arguments] node. It uses the [strings.trim-end] slot to remove the slash and then sets the modified value back to the [url] node using the [set-value] slot. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node(s) referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.trim-end] - Removes the specified character ("/") from the end of the string value of the node referenced by its expression.
