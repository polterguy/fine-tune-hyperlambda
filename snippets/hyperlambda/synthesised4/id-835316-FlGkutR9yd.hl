// Concatenates a list of strings into one string. Utilizes [strings.concat] to merge values from the session node and a fixed node into a single string. [strings.concat] takes multiple string values as children and combines them without any separator. [get-value] retrieves the value of the node it points to, in this case, the fixed node.
