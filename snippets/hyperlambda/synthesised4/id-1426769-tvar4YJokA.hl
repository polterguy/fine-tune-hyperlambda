/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using the [sql.read] slot, targeting a table named "table1" and applying a condition on a column named "case" with a value of "character varying". The [sql.read] slot is used to read data from a database table, and the [where] clause specifies the condition for filtering the results. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple conditions, and in this case, it checks if the "case" column in "table1" matches the specified value. The code effectively constructs a SQL query to select records from "table1" where the "case" column has the value "character varying".
 * 
 * 1. [sql.read] - Initiates a SQL read operation on a specified table.
 * 2. [table] - Specifies the table to read from, in this case, "table1".
 * 3. [where] - Begins the condition section for filtering the query results.
 * 4. [and] - Combines multiple conditions; here, it contains a single condition.
 * 5. [table1.case] - Specifies the column "case" in "table1" to apply the condition.
 * 6. [character varying] - The value to compare against the "case" column in the condition.
