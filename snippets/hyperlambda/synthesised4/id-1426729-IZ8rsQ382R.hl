// The code snippet dynamically adds nodes to the [.remaining] node. It uses the [add] slot to append nodes, and the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve nodes from the [.dp] node by reference. The [.dp] node is typically used in a [for-each] loop or similar constructs to represent the currently iterated node. This allows for dynamically building a node structure by adding nodes from a source node to a destination node.
