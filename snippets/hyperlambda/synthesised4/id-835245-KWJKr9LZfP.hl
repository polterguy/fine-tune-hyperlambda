// This Hyperlambda code checks if there are any result nodes under the execute node. If such nodes exist, it concatenates several strings and values to create a new prompt, which includes a JSON response from a workflow. It also updates the function-result node by appending the JSON string representation of the lambda object. The key slots used are [if], [exists], [set-value], and [strings.concat].
