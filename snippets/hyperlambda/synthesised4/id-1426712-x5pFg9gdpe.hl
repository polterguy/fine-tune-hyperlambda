// The code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda. It evaluates all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied as a value to the [unwrap] slot. In this case, it targets all descendant nodes of the [return] node within the current node's hierarchy. This allows for the pre-evaluation of expressions before the node where [unwrap] is referenced is reached, effectively preparing the values for subsequent operations.
