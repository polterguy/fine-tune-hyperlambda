// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [switch] slot in Hyperlambda, which functions similarly to a switch/case statement in traditional programming languages. It evaluates the value of [.val] and executes the corresponding [case] block that matches this value. If no [case] matches, the [default] block is executed. The [switch] slot can only contain [case] and [default] nodes, with [case] nodes requiring a value and [default] nodes being optional and value-less.
