// This Hyperlambda code checks if a specific argument named "_extra" exists within the ".arguments" node of a lambda object created by the "hyper2lambda" slot. If the "_extra" argument is found, it unwraps and evaluates the children nodes of the current node, and then adds the "_extra" argument's value to the "execute-file" node's children. This allows for dynamic execution of additional files based on the presence of the "_extra" argument.
