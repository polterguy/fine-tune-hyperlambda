// This Hyperlambda code snippet retrieves the value of the node named [.new-prompt] from the current context or node structure. The [get-value] slot is used with an expression pointing to the [.new-prompt] node, and it returns the value associated with that node. This is useful for accessing specific data within a larger Hyperlambda graph.
