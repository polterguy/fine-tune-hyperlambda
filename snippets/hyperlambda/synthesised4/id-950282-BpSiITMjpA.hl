// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.select] slot to execute a SQL query on a Microsoft SQL Server database. It retrieves the top 20 records from the "error_logs" table where the "severity" is greater than 3, ordering the results by the "created_at" column in descending order. The [database-type] argument specifies that the database is of type "mssql".
data.select:select top 20 * from error_logs where severity > 3 order by created_at desc
   database-type:mssql
