// This Hyperlambda code connects to a MySQL database named "sys" using the [mysql.connect] slot and executes SQL commands loaded from a file using [mysql.execute]. The SQL commands are retrieved through [io.file.load], which loads the content of a specified file. The [case] slot is used to conditionally execute this block of code based on the "mysql" condition.
case:mysql
