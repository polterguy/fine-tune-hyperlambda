// The code snippet demonstrates how to execute a SQL query using the [data.select] slot with a specified [database-type] of "sqlite". The [data.select] slot takes an expression pointing to a SQL statement and retrieves records from the database, returning them as a lambda object. The [database-type] argument ensures that the query is executed against a SQLite database.
data.select:x:@.sql
