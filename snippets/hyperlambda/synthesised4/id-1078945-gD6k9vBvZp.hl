/*
 * 1. `@.only-prompt`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "only-prompt" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards through its ancestors and siblings until it finds a match. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to dynamically access configuration or context-specific data that is defined earlier in the node structure, allowing for flexible and reusable code segments that adapt based on the presence of certain nodes.
