// The code uses [get-first-value] to retrieve the first non-null value from evaluating its children nodes. It first attempts to get a value from the [data.read] node's [greeting] child using [get-value]. If this yields null, it defaults to the static string "Hello there! How may I help you today?". This approach ensures a fallback value is provided if the primary data source is unavailable.
