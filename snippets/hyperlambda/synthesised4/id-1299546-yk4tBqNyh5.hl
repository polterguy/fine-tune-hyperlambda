/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to read data from a "contacts" table and yield the results. The process begins with the [data.read] slot, which is responsible for querying the database. It specifies the table name as "contacts" and includes a [where] clause with an [and] condition, although no specific conditions are provided within the [and] block in this example. This implies that the query will select all records from the "contacts" table without any filtering criteria.
 * 
 * After executing the [data.read] operation, the [yield] slot is used to return the results. The [yield] slot takes an expression as its argument, which in this case is `x:@data.read/*`. This expression retrieves all child nodes of the [data.read] node, effectively yielding all the records fetched from the "contacts" table. This setup is useful for scenarios where you want to retrieve and process all entries from a database table without applying any specific filters or conditions.
