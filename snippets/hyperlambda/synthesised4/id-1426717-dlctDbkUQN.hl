// This Hyperlambda code snippet dynamically adds nodes to the [.scan] node by retrieving nodes from the [.data.select] node. It uses the [add] slot to append the nodes obtained from the [get-nodes] slot, which points to all children of [.data.select]. The operation effectively copies the children of [.data.select] into [.scan].
