// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database to read user data based on a provided user ID, converts the retrieved data into a CSV format, and sends an email with the CSV as an attachment. The [data.connect] slot connects to the "appdb" database, [data.read] retrieves user information from the "users" table, and [lambda2csv] converts the data to CSV. The [mail.smtp.send] slot sends an email to the user with their name and email fetched from the database, and attaches the CSV file as an email attachment.
