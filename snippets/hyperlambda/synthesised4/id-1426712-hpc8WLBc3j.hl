/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to modify the value of a node by concatenating strings. It retrieves values from nodes using [get-value] and combines them with static strings using [strings.concat]. The result is assigned to the [prompt] node. The process involves the following steps:
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [prompt] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [no-invocation] node.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [only-prompt] node.
