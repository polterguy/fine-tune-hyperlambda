/*
 * 1. `@.has-double-space` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "has-double-space" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with this specific name, starting from the current node and traversing upwards through its ancestors if necessary. This is useful for checking if a specific node exists in the current execution context, which might be used to determine if a condition is met or a certain configuration is present.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Checking if a specific configuration or flag node exists in the current context to alter the flow of execution based on its presence.
 * - Validating if a particular node is part of the current node hierarchy, which might be necessary for conditional logic or branching.
