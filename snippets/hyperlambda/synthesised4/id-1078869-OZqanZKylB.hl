/*
 * 1. `@execute-file`: This iterator searches for the first node named `execute-file` in the current context. It is used to locate the node where the file execution is defined or referenced. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the execution details of a file within a Hyperlambda script.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all the children nodes of the `execute-file` node. It allows you to access any arguments or configurations that are specified as children of the `execute-file` node. This can be useful for iterating over or modifying the parameters passed to a file execution, such as input arguments or settings.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing and modifying the arguments passed to a file execution in a Hyperlambda script.
 * - Iterating over all configurations or settings related to a file execution for validation or logging purposes.
