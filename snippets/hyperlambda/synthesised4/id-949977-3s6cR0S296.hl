// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot in Hyperlambda, which is typically used within a [switch] construct to handle specific cases based on a value. In this example, when the [case] node with a value of 4 is matched, it sets the value of the [result] node to "Four car parts". This is useful for executing specific logic when a particular condition is met.
case:int:4
   set-value:x:@.result
      .:Four car parts
