/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code connects to a database using a generic or magic connection and reads from the "ml_training_snippets" table. It selects the count of all records in the table where the "type" column matches a specified value. The result is returned with the count labeled as "count" due to the aliasing in the column selection.
 * // 1. [data.connect] - Establishes a connection to the database using a specified connection type.
 * // 2. [data.read] - Initiates a read operation from the database.
 * // 3. [table] - Specifies the table "ml_training_snippets" to read from.
 * // 4. [columns] - Defines the columns to be selected, in this case, an aggregate count.
 * // 5. [count(*)] - An aggregate function to count all records.
 * // 6. [as:count] - Aliases the result of the count as "count".
 * // 7. [where] - Specifies the condition for filtering records.
 * // 8. [and] - Logical operator to combine conditions.
 * // 9. [type.eq:x:@.type] - Condition to filter records where the "type" column equals a specified value.
