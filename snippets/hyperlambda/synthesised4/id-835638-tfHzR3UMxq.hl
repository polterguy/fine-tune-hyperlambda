// This Hyperlambda code changes the names of nodes found in a specific path to a concatenated string. It uses [set-name] to modify the name of nodes at the path [./*/data.read/*/columns/*/aggregate_functor]. The new name is constructed by concatenating the value of [aggregate_function], a parenthesis "(", the value of [aggregate_column], and a closing parenthesis ")". The [strings.concat] slot is used to perform the concatenation.
