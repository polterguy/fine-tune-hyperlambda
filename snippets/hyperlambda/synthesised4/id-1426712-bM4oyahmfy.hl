/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [math.increment] slot to increase the value of a node named [.no-invocation] by 1. The [math.increment] slot directly modifies the value of the node it points to, effectively incrementing its value in place. If no step value is provided, the default increment is 1. The expression [x:@.no-invocation] indicates that the slot should operate on the node named [.no-invocation]. 
 * 
 * 1. [math.increment] - Increments the value of the node it points to.
 * 2. [x:@.no-invocation] - Expression pointing to the node to be incremented.
