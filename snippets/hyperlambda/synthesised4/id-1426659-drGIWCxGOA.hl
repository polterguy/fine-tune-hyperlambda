/*
 * This code snippet uses the [else] slot to execute a block of code if a preceding [if] condition is false. It concatenates a formatted string using [strings.concat], which includes a trimmed version of a text node obtained via [strings.trim] and a lambda expression. The result is then unwrapped using [unwrap] and added to a collection using [add]. The [strings.concat] slot is used to build a string with specific formatting, including code block markers. The final result is added to a specified location in a node structure.
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes the following block if the preceding [if] condition is false.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 3. [strings.trim] - Trims whitespace from a specified text node.
 * 4. [unwrap] - Evaluates and executes the expressions in the resulting string.
 * 5. [add] - Adds the result to a specified location in a node structure.
