// This Hyperlambda code evaluates a logical condition using the [or] slot. It checks if the [skip-auth] argument does not exist or if it exists and its value is explicitly set to false. If either of these conditions is true, the [or] slot evaluates to true. This is typically used to determine whether to bypass authentication based on the presence and value of the [skip-auth] argument.
