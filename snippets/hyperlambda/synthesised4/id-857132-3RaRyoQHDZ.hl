// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between the "Orders" and "Shippers" tables, using "ShipVia" as an alias for the "Shippers" table. The join condition is specified to match the "ShipVia" column from the "Orders" table with the "ShipperID" column from the "Shippers" table. This setup allows for combining data from both tables based on the specified relationship, while including all records from the "Orders" table and matching records from the "Shippers" table.
join:Shippers
   as:ShipVia
   type:left
   on
      and
         Orders.ShipVia:ShipVia.ShipperID
