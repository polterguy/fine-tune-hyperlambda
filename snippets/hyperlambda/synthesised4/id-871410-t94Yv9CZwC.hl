// This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL read operation on a SQLite database, targeting the "activities" table. It includes a left join with the "clients" table using the client_id as an alias. The query selects distinct columns and applies a where clause with an "and" condition, although the specific conditions are not detailed. The use of "as" allows for aliasing the join and column results.
