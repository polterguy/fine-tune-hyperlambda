/*
 * 1. `@.sql` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `sql` that exists as a sibling or ancestor to the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that it should start the search from the current node's context. 
 * 
 * Potential Use Cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve a SQL query or command that is stored in a node named `sql`. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically execute or manipulate SQL commands within a Hyperlambda script.
 * - It could also be used to access configuration or connection details related to a database operation that are stored in a node named `sql`.
