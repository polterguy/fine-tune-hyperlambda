// This Hyperlambda code replaces occurrences of a specific string within the value of the [.result] node with another string. The string to be replaced is specified by the [.end] node, and the replacement string is retrieved from the [.arguments] node's [end] child. The [strings.replace] slot is used for this operation, where the first argument is the target string to be replaced, and the second argument is the replacement string. This allows dynamic replacement based on input arguments.
strings.replace:x:@.result
   .:[[end]]
