// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] statement to handle different conditions. In this example, it is used to check if a value is of type "varbinary". If the condition is met, the associated lambda code block is executed. This allows for conditional logic based on the type of data being processed.
case:varbinary
