// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [not] slot to negate the result of an [eq] comparison. It checks if the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.arguments/*/connection-string] is not equal to a specified value, which is represented by an empty node. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [connection-string] node from the [.arguments] node set.
