// The code snippet uses the [set-name] slot to change the name of nodes referenced by its expression to a new name generated by concatenating a string and a node's value. The [strings.concat] slot combines a static string and the value of a node to form the new name. The expression in [set-name] targets specific nodes, and the concatenation involves a static string and a dynamic value retrieved using [get-value].
