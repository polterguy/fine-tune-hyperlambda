/*
 * The Hyperlambda code iterates over each URL node found under [urls] within a [signal] node. For each URL, it unwraps the node's children, sends a signal to a feedback channel with the URL's message as an argument, and pauses for 10 seconds. 
 * 
 * 1. [for-each] - Iterates over each URL node under [urls] within the [signal] node.
 * 2. [unwrap] - Evaluates all expressions within the current node.
 * 3. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to the specified feedback channel.
 * 4. [args] - Contains the arguments to be sent with the signal.
 * 5. [message] - Retrieves the message from the current URL node.
 * 6. [type] - Sets the type of the message to "info".
 * 7. [sleep] - Pauses execution for 10 seconds.
