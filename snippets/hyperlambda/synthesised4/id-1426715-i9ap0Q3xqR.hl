/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [case] slot within a [switch] statement to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a specified expression. The [switch] slot evaluates the expression and matches it against the values specified in each [case] slot. If a match is found, the corresponding block of code is executed. If no match is found, the [default] slot's block of code is executed. This structure allows for clean and organized conditional branching based on multiple potential values.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Evaluates an expression and matches it against [case] values.
 * 2. [case] - Specifies a value to match against the [switch] expression.
 * 3. [default] - Executes if no [case] values match the [switch] expression.
