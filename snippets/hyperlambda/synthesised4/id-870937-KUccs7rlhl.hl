/*
 * The Hyperlambda code removes all nodes that match the specified expression, effectively cleaning up parts of the node structure. It targets nodes within the [hyper2lambda] node, specifically under [.arguments] and [_type], and deletes them from the hierarchy. This is useful for managing and maintaining a clean node structure by eliminating unnecessary or unwanted nodes.
 * 
 * 1. [remove-nodes] - This slot removes all nodes that the expression points to, effectively cleaning up the node structure.
 * 2. [x:@hyper2lambda/*/.arguments/*/_type] - The expression specifies the path to the nodes to be removed, targeting nodes within the [hyper2lambda] node under [.arguments] and [_type].
