// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the expression [x:+/*/*] is evaluated, and the result is assigned to the node where [unwrap] is used. This allows for forward evaluation of expressions, enabling dynamic manipulation of node values before execution.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
