// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [return] slot to return a result from a Hyperlambda execution. The [return] slot is used to return a node or a value from a dynamically created slot or a context that explicitly allows returning values. In this example, it returns a node with the name [result] and the value "success". This is typically used to signal the successful completion of a process or operation.
return
