/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is useful for locating the arguments node in a Hyperlambda structure, which typically contains input parameters or data passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or endpoint, allowing further filtering or processing.
 * 
 * 3. `/email` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `email` among the children of `.arguments`. It is useful for extracting a specific argument, in this case, an email address, from the list of provided arguments.
