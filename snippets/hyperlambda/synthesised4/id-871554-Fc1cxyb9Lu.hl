// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [throw] slot in Hyperlambda to raise an exception. The [throw] slot takes an expression pointing to a node, and the value of this node becomes the exception message. In this case, it throws an exception with a message derived from the value of the current node being iterated, as indicated by the [.dp] reference.
