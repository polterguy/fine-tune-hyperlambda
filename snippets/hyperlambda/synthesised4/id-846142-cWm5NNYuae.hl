// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] block to define a specific condition or value that, when matched, triggers the execution of its associated lambda object. Each [case] node must have a value, which can be a constant or an expression, and is evaluated against the value of the [switch] node to determine if it should be executed.
