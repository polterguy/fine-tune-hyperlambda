/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to move one level up in the node hierarchy.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the node.
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "signal". It is used to narrow down the selection to specific nodes.
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes filtered by the previous iterator. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "signal" nodes.
 * 5. `url` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "url". It is used to narrow down the selection to specific nodes.
 * 
 * This expression is useful for navigating a hierarchical structure to find "url" nodes that are descendants of "signal" nodes, which themselves are children of the parent node of the current context. A potential use case could be extracting URLs from a configuration or data structure where signals are defined and each signal has associated URLs.
