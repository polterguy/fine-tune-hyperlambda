// The code uses [insert-before] to insert nodes before the first child of [fork] in the current context. It retrieves nodes from [.arguments] and [.filename] using [get-nodes] and inserts them before the specified position. The [get-nodes] slot fetches nodes referenced by its expression, allowing dynamic manipulation of the node structure.
