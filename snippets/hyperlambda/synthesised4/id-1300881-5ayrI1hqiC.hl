// This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to read data from a database table named "Course". The [data.read] slot is used to initiate the read operation, specifying the table from which to retrieve data. The [table] slot indicates that the data should be fetched from the "Course" table, and the [columns] slot specifies that only the "CourseId" and "Title" columns should be retrieved. The [where] clause is used to filter the results, ensuring that only courses taught by a specific professor are selected. This is achieved by comparing the "ProfessorId" column to a dynamic value retrieved from a node in the current context, using the expression [ProfessorId.eq:x:@.dp/#/*/ProfessorId]. Finally, the [yield] slot is used to return the results of the read operation, storing them in a node named "courses". This allows for further processing or output of the retrieved course data.
