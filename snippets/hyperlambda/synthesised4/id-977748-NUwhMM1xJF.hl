// This Hyperlambda code reads all records from the "customers" table without any limit on the number of records returned. It selects only the "Name" and "City" columns for customers where the "country" is equal to "France". The [data.read] slot is used to perform the database read operation, while the [where] clause specifies the filtering condition.
