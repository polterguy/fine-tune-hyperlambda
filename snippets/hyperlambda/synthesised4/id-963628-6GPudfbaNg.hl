// This Hyperlambda code multiplies the value of the node referenced by the expression in [get-value] with the static integer value 2 using the [math.multiply] slot. The result of this multiplication will be the value of the [math.multiply] node after execution. The code demonstrates the use of [get-value] to retrieve a node's value and [math.multiply] to perform a multiplication operation.
