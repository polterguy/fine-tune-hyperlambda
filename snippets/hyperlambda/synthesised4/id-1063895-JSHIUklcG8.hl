// 1. `@.sql` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that it will start the search from the current context. This is useful in scenarios where you have a structured data graph and need to access a specific node named "sql" to retrieve or manipulate its value. This could be used, for example, to dynamically construct or execute SQL queries stored within a Hyperlambda node structure.
