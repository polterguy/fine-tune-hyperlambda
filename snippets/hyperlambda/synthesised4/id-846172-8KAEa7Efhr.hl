// The [else] slot is used to execute a block of code if none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions evaluate to true. In this example, the [add] slot is used within the [else] block to add a new node with the name "primary" and a boolean value of true to the node set referenced by the expression [@.tmp/*]. This ensures that the "primary" node is added only when all previous conditions are false.
