// The code imports a public RSA key into the system using the [signal:magic.crypto.import-key] slot. It takes the public key generated by [crypto.rsa.create-key] and associates it with a username, enabling it for use in cryptographic operations. The [content] slot specifies the public key, [enabled] sets the key's status to true, and [username] associates the key with a specific user.
