// This Hyperlambda code uses the [not-null] slot to evaluate whether any child nodes of the first child node of the [scan] node have a non-null value for a node named [cached]. If at least one such node exists with a value, the expression will return true; otherwise, it will return false. This is useful for checking the presence of cached data in a specific location within a node structure.
