// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [convert] slot to change the type of a node's value to an unsigned integer (uint). The [convert] slot takes an expression pointing to the node whose value needs conversion, and the [type] child node specifies the target type for conversion.
convert:x:-
   type:uint
