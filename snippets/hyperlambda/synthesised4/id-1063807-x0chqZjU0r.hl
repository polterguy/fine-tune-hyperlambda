/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It looks for a node named "arguments" among the current node's ancestors and siblings.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It allows access to any node that is a direct child of "arguments".
 * 
 * 3. `database` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "database". It selects nodes named "database" from the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to access a specific "database" node within the context of an "arguments" node, such as when processing input parameters for a function or endpoint that requires database configuration or connection details.
