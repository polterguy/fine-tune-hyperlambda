// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement to handle numeric values. The [switch] slot evaluates a given expression and executes the first matching [case] node. In this example, the [case] node is used to match a specific numeric value, allowing for conditional execution based on the evaluated expression.
