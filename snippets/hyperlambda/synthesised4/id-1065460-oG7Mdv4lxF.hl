// 1. `@.fields`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "fields" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node's siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you want to access a specific node named "fields" without knowing its exact position relative to the current node, as it will find the closest match in the hierarchy.
