// This Hyperlambda code updates records in the "orders" table, changing the "status" field from "pending" to "processed". It uses the [data.update] slot with a [where] condition to target specific records. The [table] node specifies the table name, [where] defines the condition for selecting records, and [values] lists the columns and their new values.
