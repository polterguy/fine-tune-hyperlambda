/*
 * // Hyperlambda switch case example
 * // This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement to execute different code blocks based on the value of a specific node. The [switch] statement evaluates the value of the node it references and executes the corresponding [case] block that matches this value. If no [case] matches, the [default] block is executed if provided. This mechanism allows for conditional execution of code based on different possible values, similar to switch/case constructs in traditional programming languages. Below is a breakdown of the slots used in this example:
 * // 1. [switch] - Evaluates the value of a node and determines which [case] block to execute.
 * // 2. [case] - Represents a possible value match for the [switch] statement. Executes its children if the [switch] value matches its own value.
 * // 3. [default] - Executes if none of the [case] values match the [switch] value. Optional in a [switch] statement.
