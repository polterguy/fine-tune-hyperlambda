/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes to a specific location in a node graph. The [add] slot is used to insert nodes from the result of a [get-nodes] operation into the specified path. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] path, and these nodes are then added to the path specified by the [add] slot's expression. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts nodes at the specified location in the node graph.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] path to be added.
