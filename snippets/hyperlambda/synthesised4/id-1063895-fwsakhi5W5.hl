/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by selecting the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot, especially in the context of HTTP endpoints or dynamic slot execution.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument that has been passed in, regardless of its specific name.
 * 
 * 3. `columnName` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "columnName". It is used to specifically target and retrieve the node representing the "columnName" argument, assuming it exists among the children of the "arguments" node.
