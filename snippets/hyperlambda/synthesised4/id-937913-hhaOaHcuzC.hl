// This Hyperlambda code snippet connects to a SQLite database and reads from the "CustomerDemographics" table. It selects the count of all records, aliasing the result as "count". The [where] clause is present but does not specify any conditions, and the [limit] is set to 1, restricting the result to a single record.
