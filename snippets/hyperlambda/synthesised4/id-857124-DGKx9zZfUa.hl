// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Order Details" and "Products", using the [join] slot. The join is based on matching the "ProductID" column from both tables. The [as] slot is used to alias the "Products" table as "ProductID". The [type] slot specifies the join type as "left", ensuring that all records from "Order Details" are included, even if there are no matching records in "Products".
join:Products
   as:ProductID
   type:left
   on
      and
         Order Details.ProductID:ProductID.ProductID
