// This Hyperlambda code connects to a PostgreSQL database named "sales" and deletes records from the "orders" table where the "customer_id" is 42 and the "status" is "canceled". The [pgsql.connect] slot establishes the database connection, while the [pgsql.delete] slot specifies the table and conditions for deletion using the [where] clause with [and] logical operator.
pgsql.connect:sales

         and
            customer_id.eq:int:42
