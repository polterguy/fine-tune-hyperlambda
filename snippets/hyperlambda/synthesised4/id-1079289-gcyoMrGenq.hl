/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it should search for a node by name. The `.` before "sql" specifies that it should look for this node in the current context or scope, not in a child or sibling node. This is useful for retrieving the "sql" node's value or children, which might contain SQL query strings or related data.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving and executing an SQL query stored in a node named "sql" within the current context.
 * - Accessing configuration or connection details for a database operation stored in a "sql" node.
