// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specified location. It retrieves nodes using the [get-nodes] slot from a data selection and appends them to the [.open-tickets] node. The [get-nodes] slot fetches nodes from the result of a data selection query, and the [add] slot attaches these nodes to the [.open-tickets] node.
