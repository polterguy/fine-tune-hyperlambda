/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it will search for the first occurrence of a node with this specific name. This is useful when you want to access a specific node by its name within the current hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the node is another node itself, allowing you to work with the original node by reference. This is particularly useful when you want to modify the original node directly, rather than working with a copy of it.
