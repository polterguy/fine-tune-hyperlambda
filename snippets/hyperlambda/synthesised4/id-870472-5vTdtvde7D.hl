// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-name] slot to rename all nodes with the name [data.read] within the entire hierarchy of the [hyper2lambda] node to [mysql.read]. This operation is useful for transforming or refactoring Hyperlambda code to target a specific database adapter, in this case, MySQL, by replacing generic data access slots with MySQL-specific ones. The [set-name] slot takes an expression to locate nodes and a new name to assign to them.
set-name:x:@hyper2lambda/**/data.read
   .:mysql.read
