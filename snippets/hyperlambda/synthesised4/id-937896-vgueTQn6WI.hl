// The code iterates over each text node within list items in the HTML converted to a lambda structure, unwraps nested nodes, and appends the unwrapped text to a "questions" node within a "return" node. It uses [for-each] to loop through text nodes, [unwrap] to evaluate nested nodes, and [add] to append the processed text to a specific location in the node structure.
