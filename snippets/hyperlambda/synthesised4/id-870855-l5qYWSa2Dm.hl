// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a string within a node's value. It concatenates the name of the node with its value using [strings.concat], and replaces the specified string in [.body] with this concatenated result. The [get-name] and [get-value] slots are used to retrieve the node's name and value, respectively, for the replacement operation.
strings.replace:x:@.body
   strings.concat
      .:{{
      get-name:x:@.dp/#
      .:}}
   get-value:x:@.dp/#
