// The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expression provided in its value before the node where it's referenced is reached, effectively forward evaluating expressions. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is used with the expression [x:+/*], which will evaluate and return all children nodes of the current node's elder sibling. This is useful for dynamically evaluating and assigning values to nodes before they are actually executed in the Hyperlambda code.
unwrap:x:+/*
