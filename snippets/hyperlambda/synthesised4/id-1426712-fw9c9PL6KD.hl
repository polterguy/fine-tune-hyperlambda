// This Hyperlambda code snippet removes all nodes named "temperature" that are children of the "payload" node, which in turn is a child of an "http.post" node, within a specified lambda structure. The [remove-nodes] slot is used to target and delete these nodes based on the provided lambda expression, effectively cleaning up or modifying the lambda object by removing unwanted or unnecessary "temperature" nodes from the HTTP POST request payload.
