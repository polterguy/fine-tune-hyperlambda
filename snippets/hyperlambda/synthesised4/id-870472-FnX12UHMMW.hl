// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-name] slot to change the name of all nodes within the hierarchy starting from [hyper2lambda] that have the name [data.update] to [mysql.update]. This operation is useful for refactoring or adapting code to use a different database adapter, ensuring that all relevant nodes are updated to reflect the new naming convention.
