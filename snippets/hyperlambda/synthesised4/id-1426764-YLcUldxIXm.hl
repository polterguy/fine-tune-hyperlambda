/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [case] node is an unsigned integer and sets the value of the [type] node to "long". 
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Declares a node with an integer value.
 * 2. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [type] node.
 * 3. [.] - Provides the static value "long" to be set as the value of the [type] node.
