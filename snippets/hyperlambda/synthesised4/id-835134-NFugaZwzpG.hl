/*
 * The code checks if a "description" node exists within the children of the current node being iterated by reference. If it exists, it unwraps the children of the next sibling node and adds a "description" node to the ".prop" node, setting its value to the description found in the current node. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if the condition is true.
 * 2. [exists] - Evaluates if a "description" node exists in the specified path.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Executes the block if the condition is true.
 * 4. [unwrap] - Evaluates and unwraps the children of the next sibling node.
 * 5. [add] - Adds a new node to the ".prop" node.
 * 6. [.] - Represents a static value.
 * 7. [description] - Sets the value of the new node to the description found.
