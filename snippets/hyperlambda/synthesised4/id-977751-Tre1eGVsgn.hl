/*
 * The Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to retrieve a paginated and ordered subset of records from a database table named "products". The [data.read] slot is used to select records, ordering them by the "price" column in descending order. The [offset] slot skips the first 5 records, and the [limit] slot restricts the result set to 5 records. This approach is useful for implementing pagination in database queries. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.read] - Initiates a database read operation.
 * 2. [table] - Specifies the table name to read from, which is "products".
 * 3. [order] - Indicates the column to order the results by, which is "price".
 * 4. [direction] - Sets the order direction to descending.
 * 5. [offset] - Skips the first 5 records in the result set.
 * 6. [limit] - Limits the result set to 5 records.
