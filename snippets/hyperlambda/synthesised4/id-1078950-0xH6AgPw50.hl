// 1. `@.value` - This iterator starts with an `@`, which indicates that it will find the first node with the name "value" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. The `@` operator is used to search for nodes by name, and the `.` following it specifies that the search should begin from the current node's context. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to retrieve or manipulate the value of a node named "value" that is related to the current node, such as when you are working within a loop or a conditional block and need to access a specific sibling or ancestor node's value.
