// The code uses the [time] slot to create a time span, which is then subtracted from another time value using the [math.subtract] slot. The [time] slot can take arguments like [days], [hours], [minutes], [seconds], or [milliseconds] to define the time span. The [math.subtract] slot performs the subtraction operation, allowing for time manipulation by reducing the specified time span from a given time value.
