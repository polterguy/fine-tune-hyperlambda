/*
 * The code snippet uses the [set-name] slot to change the names of nodes referenced by its expression. It targets nodes within a specific hierarchy and sets their names to the value retrieved from a child node named [type]. The [get-value] slot is used to obtain the value of the [type] node, which is then used as the new name for the nodes specified by the [set-name] expression. The process involves iterating through nodes and dynamically renaming them based on their [type] child node's value. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the names of nodes referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [type] node to use as the new name.
