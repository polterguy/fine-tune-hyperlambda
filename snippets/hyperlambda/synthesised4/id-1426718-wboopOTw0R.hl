/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to determine the type of a node's value. It first declares a node [.foo] with an integer value of 57. Then, it uses the [type] slot with an expression pointing to the previous node to retrieve the type of the [.foo] node's value. The result of the [type] invocation will be the type name of the value, which is "int" in this case.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type of the previous node's value, which is "int".
