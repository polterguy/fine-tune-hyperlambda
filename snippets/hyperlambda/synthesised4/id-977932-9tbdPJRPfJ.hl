// This Hyperlambda code dynamically adds nodes to the [.result] node. It creates a child node with the name derived from the result of [get-name], and a child node [val] whose value is set by retrieving the value of the node referenced by [.dp]. The [.dp] node is typically used in loops or dynamic slot executions to reference the current node being processed.
