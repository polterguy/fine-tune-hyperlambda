/*
 * This Hyperlambda code performs a division operation where it first subtracts the value of the [max_tokens] node from 32768 and then divides the result by 2. The [math.subtract] slot is used to calculate the difference, and the [math.divide] slot is used to perform the division. The code effectively reduces the [max_tokens] value by half after subtracting it from 32768. 
 * 
 * 1. [math.divide] - Divides the result of the subtraction by 2.
 * 2. [math.subtract] - Subtracts the value of [max_tokens] from 32768.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [max_tokens] node.
