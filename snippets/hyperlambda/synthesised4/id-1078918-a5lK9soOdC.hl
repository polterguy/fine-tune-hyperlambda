/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. The `@` symbol is used to find a node by name, and it searches for the first occurrence of [.arguments] starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It allows you to access every direct child node under [.arguments].
 * 
 * 3. `submit_button` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [submit_button]. It selects nodes with the name [submit_button] from the children of [.arguments].
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used to access the [submit_button] node within an HTTP endpoint's arguments, allowing you to manipulate or evaluate the state of a form submission button.
 * - It could be used in a validation routine to check if the submit button's state or value meets certain criteria before proceeding with further processing.
