// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [Type] node, which is a child of the node referenced by [.dp], is equal to the string "boolean". The [eq] slot is used for equality comparison, and it evaluates to true if the two arguments provided are exactly the same. The first argument retrieves the value of the [Type] node using the [get-value] slot with an expression, while the second argument is the static string "boolean".
