 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node named `.sql` that is found in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and the `.` before `sql` specifies that it is a direct child of the current node. This expression is useful for accessing SQL-related data or commands stored in a node named `.sql`. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a SQL query or command stored in a `.sql` node for execution or manipulation.
 * - Retrieving configuration or connection details for a database operation stored in a `.sql` node.
