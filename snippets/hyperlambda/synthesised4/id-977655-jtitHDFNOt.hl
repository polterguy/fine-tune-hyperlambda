// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "chat_logs" table. It retrieves the count of all records in the table, using the [columns] slot to specify the SQL column operation "count(*)" and aliasing it as "count". The [limit] slot is set to 1, indicating that only one record should be returned, which in this context will be the count of records in the table. The [database-type] slot specifies that the database being queried is SQLite.
