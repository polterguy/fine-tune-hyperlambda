/*
 * 1. `@data.select` - This iterator searches for the first node named "data.select" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate a node with a known name within a complex structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node found by the previous iterator. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "data.select" node. This is useful when you want to perform operations on all child nodes of a specific parent node, such as iterating over them or modifying their values.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting and processing all child nodes of a "data.select" node in a data processing pipeline.
 * - Iterating over configuration settings or parameters stored as child nodes under a "data.select" node to apply specific logic or transformations.
