// This Hyperlambda code checks if the maximum number of requests for a model has been reached. It uses [neq] to ensure the [max_requests] is not -1, and [mte] to compare [no_requests] and [max_requests]. If both conditions are true, it throws a public exception with a status of 500, indicating the limit has been reached.
