// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using the [data.read] slot with a SQLite database. It specifies a left join between the "notes" and "clients" tables, using "client_id" as an alias for the join condition. The query selects distinct columns using a functor, and the [where] clause is prepared for additional conditions. Key slots include [database-type] for specifying the database, [join] for table joining, and [columns] for selecting specific data.
