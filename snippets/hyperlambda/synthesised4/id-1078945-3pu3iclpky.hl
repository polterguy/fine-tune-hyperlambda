/*
 * 1. `@.exe`: This iterator starts by locating the first node named `.exe` within the current context. It searches for the node in the current hierarchy, starting from the current node and moving upwards or sideways until it finds the first occurrence of a node with the name `.exe`.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found `.exe` node. It allows you to access every direct child node under the `.exe` node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `signal`: This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes named `signal` from the children nodes of `.exe`. It effectively narrows down the selection to nodes specifically named `signal`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to retrieve all `signal` nodes that are direct children of an `.exe` node. For instance, in a system monitoring application, this could be used to gather all signal-related data or events associated with a specific executable process.
 * - Another use case could be in a configuration management system where you need to extract specific signal configurations or statuses associated with a particular executable or process.
