// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [strings.replace] slot in Hyperlambda to replace occurrences of a placeholder within a string. It targets a node specified by the expression [@.body] and replaces the placeholder "{{email}}" with the value retrieved from the [.arguments] node's [email] child. This allows dynamic substitution of email addresses in a given text body.
strings.replace:x:@.body
   .:{{email}}
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/email
