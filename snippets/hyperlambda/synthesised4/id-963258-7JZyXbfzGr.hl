// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to convert the value of a node referenced by an expression to a specified type using the [convert] slot. The [convert] slot is used to change the type of the value of the node pointed to by the expression [x:@.data] to an integer, as specified by the [type] argument. The conversion will succeed if the original value can be converted to the specified type; otherwise, it will throw an exception.
convert:x:@.data
   type:int
