// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each node in the result set of [data.read], sending an email to the address specified in each node. It uses [for-each] to loop through the nodes, [mail.smtp.send] to send the email, and constructs the email message with a [subject] and [entity] containing the email content. The recipient's email address is dynamically retrieved using an expression pointing to the [email] node within each iterated node.
