// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, it evaluates the expression of the node immediately following it, effectively "unwrapping" the value. The result is that the value of the node is evaluated and assigned before the instruction pointer reaches it. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions in lambda objects.
