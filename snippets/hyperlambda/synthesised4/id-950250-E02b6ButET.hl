// The code iterates through each match found in a set of strings using [for-each], unwrapping the contents of each match, and then adds these unwrapped nodes to a [dates] node. The [for-each] slot iterates over each match, [unwrap] evaluates the contents of the match, and [add] appends the evaluated result to the [dates] node.
