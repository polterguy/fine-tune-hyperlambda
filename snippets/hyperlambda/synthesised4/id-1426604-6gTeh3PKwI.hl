// This Hyperlambda code checks if there are any nodes under the path [.body/*/requestBody/*/content/*/*/schema/*/properties]. If any nodes exist at this path, the [exists] slot will return true; otherwise, it will return false. This is useful for verifying the presence of specific properties in a schema within a request body.
