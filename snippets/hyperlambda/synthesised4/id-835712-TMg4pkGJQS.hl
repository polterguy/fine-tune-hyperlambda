// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of nodes within a specific path to a concatenated string. It uses [set-name] to target nodes under [data.read] and [columns], specifically those named [aggregate_functor]. The new name is constructed using [strings.concat], combining the value of [aggregate_function] and [aggregate_column] from the [.arguments] node, formatted as a function call with parentheses.
set-name:x:./*/data.read/*/columns/*/aggregate_functor
   strings.concat
      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/aggregate_function
      .:(
      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/aggregate_column
