/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint, which contains all the input parameters passed to the function.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or endpoint individually.
 * 
 * 3. `database`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `database` among the children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to specifically access the `database` argument, which might contain configuration or connection details for a database operation.
