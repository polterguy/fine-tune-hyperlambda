// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied with the expression "x:+/*/*", which evaluates the nodes based on their position in the hierarchy. The expression starts with "x:+" indicating to move to the elder sibling, then "/*/*" retrieves all children of the current node's children. This effectively evaluates the specified nodes before reaching the [unwrap] node, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions within the lambda object.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
