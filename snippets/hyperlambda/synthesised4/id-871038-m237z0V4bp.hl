// This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if both the [foreignTable] and [foreignField] nodes within the [.arguments] node have non-null values. The [and] slot ensures that both conditions must be true for the overall evaluation to be true. The [not-null] slots evaluate their expressions to confirm that the specified nodes exist and have values.
