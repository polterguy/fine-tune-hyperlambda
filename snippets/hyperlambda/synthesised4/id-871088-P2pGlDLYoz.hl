// The code snippet demonstrates a loop that continues as long as two conditions are met: the existence of a node at a specific path and a token count exceeding a maximum value. Within the loop, it removes a node and updates a JSON value. The [while] slot iterates the block, [and] checks both conditions, [exists] verifies node presence, [mt] compares token counts, [remove-nodes] deletes a node, and [set-value] updates the JSON using [lambda2json].
