/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses a [switch] statement to evaluate the value of the [grade] node. It contains multiple [case] nodes, each corresponding to a different grade, and logs a message indicating the performance level associated with that grade. If the grade is not recognized, the [default] case logs an "Unknown grade" message. 
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Evaluates the value of the [grade] node.
 * 2. [case:A] - Logs "Excellent" if the grade is A.
 * 3. [case:B] - Logs "Good" if the grade is B.
 * 4. [case:C] - Logs "Average" if the grade is C.
 * 5. [case:D] - Logs "Poor" with a warning if the grade is D.
 * 6. [case:F] - Logs "Fail" as an error if the grade is F.
 * 7. [default] - Logs "Unknown grade" if none of the cases match.
