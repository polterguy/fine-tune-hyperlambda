// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else-if] slot to evaluate a condition. It checks if the value of the [src] node is equal to 2 using the [eq] slot. If true, it executes the lambda block, which sets the value of the [result] node to "ERROR" using the [set-value] slot. The [else-if] slot is used for conditional branching, allowing for alternative execution paths if previous conditions are false.
