// The code sets the value of the [.title2] node to the first non-null value obtained from evaluating the children nodes of [get-first-value]. It first attempts to retrieve the value from a specific path in the HTTP POST response, and if that yields no result, it defaults to an empty value. This ensures [.title2] is always assigned a value, even if the primary source is unavailable.
