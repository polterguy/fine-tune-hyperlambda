/*
 * This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the first node with the name "alt" that is a child of the node referenced by the [.dp] node, using the [get-value] slot. The expression uses a combination of iterators to navigate the node structure and extract the desired value.
 * 
 * 1. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node its expression is pointing to.
 * 2. [x:"@.dp/#/*/\\@alt/[0,1]"] - The expression navigates to the [.dp] node, de-references its value, retrieves all its children, filters for nodes named "alt", and selects the first one.
