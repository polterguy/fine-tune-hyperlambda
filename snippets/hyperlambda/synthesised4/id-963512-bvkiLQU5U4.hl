// This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database named "chinook" and executes a SQL query to select media types and their aggregate counts from the MediaType table, joining with the Track table. It filters results based on a provided filter, groups by MediaTypeId, and orders the results by count in descending order. The results are returned as nodes.
