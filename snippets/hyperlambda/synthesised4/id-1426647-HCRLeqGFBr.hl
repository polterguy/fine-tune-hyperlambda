/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to set the value of a node by concatenating strings and node values. It uses the [set-value] slot to assign a concatenated string to the node referenced by its expression. The concatenation is achieved using the [strings.concat] slot, which combines a series of strings and values retrieved from other nodes. The code retrieves the name of a node and its ancestor's name, concatenating these with static strings to form a new value.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates a list of strings and node values into a single string.
 * 3. [.] - A static string value "--/execute/=" used as part of the concatenation.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a node, specifically the name of an ancestor node.
 * 5. [get-name] - Retrieves the name of the node referenced by its expression.
