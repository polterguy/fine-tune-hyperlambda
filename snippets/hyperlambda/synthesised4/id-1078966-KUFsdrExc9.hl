/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access all argument nodes that are directly under the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `feedback-channel` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [feedback-channel] from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically access the [feedback-channel] node among the arguments.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda endpoint or function to retrieve the value of a [feedback-channel] argument. This might be useful in scenarios where the endpoint needs to process or route feedback based on the specified channel.
