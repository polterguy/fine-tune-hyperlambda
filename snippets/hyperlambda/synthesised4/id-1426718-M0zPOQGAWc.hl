// The code snippet demonstrates how to handle a specific case labeled "vb" within a switch-case structure. When the "vb" case is matched, it performs two actions: it sets a node named [.handle] to a boolean value of true, indicating that the case has been handled, and it appends the string "Programming language: VB.NET" to the existing value of a node named [.file-meta] using string concatenation. This effectively updates the metadata to include information about the programming language being VB.NET.
case:vb
   set-value:x:@.handle
      .:bool:true
   set-value:x:@.file-meta
      strings.concat
         get-value:x:@.file-meta
         .:"Programming language: VB.NET"
