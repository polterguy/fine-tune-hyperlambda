/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if the value of [.number-of-trials] is greater than 40 using the [gt] slot. If the condition is true, it sets the value of [.verdict] to "You are worthy!" using the [set-value] slot. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Evaluates a condition and executes its lambda object if the condition is true.
 * 2. [gt] - Compares two values and returns true if the first is greater than the second.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node it points to.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 5. [set-value] - Sets the value of a specified node.
