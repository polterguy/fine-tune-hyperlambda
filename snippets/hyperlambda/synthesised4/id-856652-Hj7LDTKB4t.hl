// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to update the value of nodes found at the path [.buffer/*/url/*/verb/*/description] with the value retrieved from the path [.dp/#/*/description] using the [get-value] slot. This operation effectively synchronizes the description values from one location in the data structure to another.
set-value:x:@.buffer/*/url/*/verb/*/description
   get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/description
