// This Hyperlambda code uses a [switch] statement to determine the value of [total-score] based on the value of [plan]. If [plan] is "silver", it adds 10 to [base-score]; if [plan] is "gold", it adds 25 to [base-score]. The [set-value] slot updates [total-score] with the result of the [math.add] operation.
