// The [unwrap] slot in this Hyperlambda code is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. The expression "x:+/*/*" will be evaluated, and the result will be used as the value of the node where [unwrap] is applied. This allows for the forward evaluation of expressions inside a lambda object, enabling dynamic manipulation of node values before execution.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
