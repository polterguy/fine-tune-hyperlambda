// This Hyperlambda code uses the [not] slot to logically invert the result of an [and] condition. The [and] slot checks two conditions: whether the HTTP POST response status code is "more than or equal" to 200 using [mte], and whether it is "less than" 300 using [lt]. The [not] slot will return true only if the combined [and] condition is false, effectively checking if the status code is outside the range of 200 to 299.
