/*
 * 1. `@.no-invocation`: This iterator starts by looking for a node named "no-invocation" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for the first node with the specified name. In this case, it will look for a node named "no-invocation" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to check if a node named "no-invocation" exists in the current context, which might be relevant in scenarios where certain operations should only be performed if a specific node is present or absent.
