// The Hyperlambda code uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a SignalR signal to all connections associated with the session specified by the expression [x:@.session]. The signal includes an argument [function_waiting] with a boolean value of true, indicating that a function is waiting or ready. This allows real-time communication with clients connected to the specified session. The [args] node contains the data to be sent in JSON format.
