// This Hyperlambda code uses the [and] slot to evaluate three conditions: [exists], [not-null], and [neq]. The [exists] slot checks if there are any nodes at the specified path, [not-null] checks if any of these nodes have a value, and [neq] compares the value of these nodes to a given value. All conditions must be true for the [and] slot to evaluate to true.
