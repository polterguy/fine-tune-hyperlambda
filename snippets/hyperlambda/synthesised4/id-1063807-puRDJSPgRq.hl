// 1. `-`: This iterator retrieves the previous node or the node above the current node in the Hyperlambda hierarchy. It is used to navigate to the immediate elder sibling of the current node. This can be useful when you need to access or manipulate the node that precedes the current node in the structure, allowing for operations that depend on the context or value of the previous node.
