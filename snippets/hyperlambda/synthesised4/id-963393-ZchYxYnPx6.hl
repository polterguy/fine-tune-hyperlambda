// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates a database transaction using [data.transaction.create] to delete users with a 'pending' status. It simulates a failure with [throw], causing the transaction to roll back since [data.transaction.commit] is not reached. The [try] slot is used to handle potential exceptions.
try
   data.transaction.create
      data.execute:"delete from users where status = 'pending'"
      throw:Simulated failure
