/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [set-value] slot to update the value of the [.result] node by trimming any leading or trailing whitespace from its current value using the [strings.trim] slot. The [strings.trim] slot removes specified characters from both ends of a string, and in this case, it defaults to trimming whitespace characters. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.trim] - Trims leading and trailing whitespace from the string value of the node specified in its expression.
