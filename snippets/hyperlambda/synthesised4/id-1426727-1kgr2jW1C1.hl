// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied to the current node's next sibling, as indicated by the expression "+/**", which means it will evaluate all the children of the next sibling node. This allows for the pre-evaluation of expressions, making it useful for scenarios where you want to forward evaluate expressions before executing the lambda object.
unwrap:x:+/**
