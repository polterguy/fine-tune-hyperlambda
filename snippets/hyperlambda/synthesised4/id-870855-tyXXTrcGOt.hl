// The Hyperlambda code snippet replaces occurrences of a placeholder string "{{name}}" within the node specified by the expression [.body] with the actual value obtained from the [.arguments] node's [name] child. The [strings.replace] slot is used for this substitution, where the first argument is the placeholder to look for, and the second argument is the value to replace it with, which is dynamically retrieved using [get-value].
strings.replace:x:@.body
   .:{{name}}
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/name
