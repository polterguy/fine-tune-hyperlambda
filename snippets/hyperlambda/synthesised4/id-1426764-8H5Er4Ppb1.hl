/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot to perform a conditional check on a bigint value. The [case] slot is used to compare a given value against multiple cases, executing the corresponding block of code when a match is found. This is particularly useful for handling multiple conditions based on a single value, similar to a switch-case statement in other programming languages. Below is a breakdown of the slots used in the example:
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Initiates a case statement to evaluate a bigint value.
 * 2. [bigint] - Represents the value being evaluated in the case statement.
