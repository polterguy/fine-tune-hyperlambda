// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [crypto.hash.sha256] slot to compute the SHA256 hash of the value of the node directly above it. The [crypto.hash.sha256] slot is a convenience overload that specifies the SHA256 algorithm for hashing, and the expression "x:-" indicates that it takes the value of the previous node in the hierarchy as input for hashing.
crypto.hash.sha256:x:-
