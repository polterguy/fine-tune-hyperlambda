/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet concatenates a string to form a detailed response message. It uses [set-value] to change the value of the [.new-prompt] node, appending various components. The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate the current value of [.new-prompt] with a static string "Response from '", the value from [execute] node's [workflow] child, a JSON formatted string, and the result from [lambda2json]. The concatenation includes line breaks and backticks for formatting purposes. Below is a breakdown of the slots used:
 * 
 * 1. [set-value]: Changes the value of [.new-prompt] by concatenating new strings.
 * 2. [strings.concat]: Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 3. [get-value]: Retrieves the current value of [.new-prompt].
 * 4. [get-value]: Retrieves the value from [execute] node's [workflow] child.
 * 5. [get-value]: Retrieves the result from [lambda2json].
 * 6. [.]: Static string components for formatting the response message.
