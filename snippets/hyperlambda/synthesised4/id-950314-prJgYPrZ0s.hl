// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a loop using the [while] slot, which continues executing as long as the condition specified by [neq] is true. The loop checks if the value of [.progress] is not equal to 100, and if so, it logs a message "Processing..." and increments the [.progress] value by 1 using [math.increment]. The loop will terminate once [.progress] reaches 100.
