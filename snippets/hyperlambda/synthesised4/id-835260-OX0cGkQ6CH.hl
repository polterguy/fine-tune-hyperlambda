// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node it's referenced in is reached, allowing for forward evaluation. In this example, [unwrap] is used to evaluate the expression [x:+/*], which will process all sibling nodes of the current node, ensuring their values are resolved before proceeding. This is useful for dynamic evaluations in Hyperlambda.
unwrap:x:+/*
