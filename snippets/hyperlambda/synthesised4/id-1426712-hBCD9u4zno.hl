/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the node referenced by [.outgoing] to the first non-null value obtained from either the [webhook_outgoing] argument or a configuration value retrieved using [config.get]. The [get-first-value] slot evaluates its children sequentially and returns the first non-null result, which is then used by [set-value] to update the [.outgoing] node. The code is useful for determining a priority source for the [.outgoing] value, defaulting to a configuration setting if no argument is provided. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of [.outgoing] with the result from [get-first-value].
 * 2. [get-first-value] - Evaluates its children nodes and returns the first non-null value.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [webhook_outgoing] argument.
 * 4. [config.get] - Fetches a configuration value from the specified path.
