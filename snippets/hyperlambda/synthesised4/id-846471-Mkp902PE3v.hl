// The code retrieves all nodes that are children of the [offset] node within the [.arguments] node. This is achieved using the [get-nodes] slot, which evaluates the expression to locate the specified nodes. The expression uses the "@" iterator to find the [offset] node and the "/*" iterator to select all its children.
