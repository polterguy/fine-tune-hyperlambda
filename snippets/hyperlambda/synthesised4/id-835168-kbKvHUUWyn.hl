// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to insert a record into a "users_roles" table. It uses the [data.create] slot to specify the table and the [values] node to define the data to be inserted. The [user] field is dynamically populated with the email of the authenticated user by referencing the [auth.token.verify] slot, while the [role] field is statically set to "guest".
data.create
   table:users_roles
   values
      user:x:@auth.token.verify/*/email
      role:guest
