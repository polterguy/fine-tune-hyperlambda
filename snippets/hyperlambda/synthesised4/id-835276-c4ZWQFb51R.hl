// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes. It adds nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot, which points to the children of the node referenced by [.dp], to the node path specified by the [add] slot's expression. This effectively merges the children nodes of [.dp] into the target node path.
