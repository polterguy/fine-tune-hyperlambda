// The [convert] slot in Hyperlambda is used to convert the value of an expression from its original type to a specified type. The type is provided as an argument to the slot. This slot can also be used to base64 encode and decode values by specifying "base64" or "from-base64" as the type argument. The conversion will only succeed if the value supports conversion to the specified type, otherwise, it will throw an exception.
