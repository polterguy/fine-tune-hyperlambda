// This Hyperlambda code uses the [validators.regex] slot to validate that the [username] node within the [.arguments] node matches a specific regular expression pattern. The pattern ensures that the username consists of 3 to 16 characters, allowing only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens. If the username does not conform to this pattern, an exception will be thrown.
