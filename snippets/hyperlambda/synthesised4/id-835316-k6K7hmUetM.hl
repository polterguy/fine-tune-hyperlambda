// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node. It retrieves the value from the node specified by [get-value] and assigns it to the node specified by [set-value]. The [set-value] slot targets the [.prompt] node, while the [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the [.only-prompt] node.
set-value:x:@.prompt
   get-value:x:@.only-prompt
