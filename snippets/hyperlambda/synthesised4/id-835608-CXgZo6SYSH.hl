// This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL read operation on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "Order Details" table. It includes left joins with the "Orders" and "Products" tables using the "OrderID" and "ProductID" fields respectively. The query selects a count of rows and applies a limit of one record. The [where] clause is present but not specified, indicating potential conditions for filtering results.
