/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named [.arguments] starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda execution context, which contains the parameters passed to a slot or an endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any parameter nodes that are direct children of the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `order` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [order] among the children of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access a specific argument or parameter named "order" that was passed to the slot or endpoint.
