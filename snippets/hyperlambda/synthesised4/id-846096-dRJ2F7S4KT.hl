// The [else] slot is used to execute a block of code if all preceding [if] and [else-if] conditions evaluate to false. In this example, the [set-value] slot is used to change the value of the [.result] node, using [strings.replace] to replace occurrences of the [[clear_button]] placeholder in the [.result] node with the string "false". This ensures that if no other conditions are met, the [.result] node is updated accordingly.
