// The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expression provided in its value before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this case, it will evaluate the expression `x:+/*`, which means it will forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied. This is useful for dynamically evaluating expressions within a lambda object before execution.
unwrap:x:+/*
