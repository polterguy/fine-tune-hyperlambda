/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "result" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it should search for a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate the value of a node named "result" within the current execution context. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to fetch the value of a "result" node after performing some calculations or operations, allowing you to use or display the result in subsequent logic.
