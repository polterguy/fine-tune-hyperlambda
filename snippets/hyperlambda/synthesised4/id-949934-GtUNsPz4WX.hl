// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [eval] slot to execute a lambda object directly provided as its child. It sets the value of the [.res] node to the string "Inline" by using the [set-value] slot within the [eval] block. This illustrates how [eval] can execute inline lambda objects, allowing for dynamic execution of code within the Hyperlambda script.
