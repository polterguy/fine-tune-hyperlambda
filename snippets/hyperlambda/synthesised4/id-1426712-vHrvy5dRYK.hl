// This Hyperlambda code uses the [not-null] slot to check if there is at least one node under the [.arguments] node with the name "data" that has a non-null value. If such a node exists, the [not-null] slot will evaluate to true, otherwise, it will evaluate to false. This is useful for validating that a required argument named "data" has been provided and is not empty before proceeding with further operations.
