// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by its expression value. It targets the [signal] node within a specific path, ensuring that all descendant nodes are explicitly evaluated. The path includes nodes like [magic.ai.crawl-site], [.onafter], and [.auto_destruct], indicating a structured hierarchy for a specific operation or event.
