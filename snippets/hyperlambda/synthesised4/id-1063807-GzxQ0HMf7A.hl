/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator looks for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda, as `.arguments` is a conventional node name for holding input parameters.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any parameters or data that might be stored as children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `database`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `database` among the children of `.arguments`. It is used to specifically access a parameter or data node named `database`, which might hold information such as a database connection string, database name, or other related configuration data.
