/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is before the current node in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node, which in this case is the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `distinct_column` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "distinct_column". It is used to specifically access the argument or node named "distinct_column" among the children of the "arguments" node.
