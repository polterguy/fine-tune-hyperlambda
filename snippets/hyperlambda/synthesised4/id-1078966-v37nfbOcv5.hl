/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (the next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda structure) of the current node. It is useful when you need to access the next node in a sequence or list.
 * 
 * 2. `/**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the current node, including the node itself, using a "breadth-first" algorithm. It is useful for accessing all nodes within a subtree, allowing for operations like searching or processing all elements within a specific section of the Hyperlambda graph.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - You might use this expression to navigate from a specific node to its next sibling and then gather all nodes within that sibling's subtree. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to apply transformations or extract data from a specific section of a Hyperlambda structure, such as processing all configuration settings or data entries that are organized hierarchically.
