// The [set-value] slot in Hyperlambda changes the value of a node referenced by its expression. In this example, it sets the value of the node pointed to by [@.dp/#] to a specified value. The [@.dp/#] expression references the current node being iterated over, allowing for dynamic updates within a loop or similar construct.
set-value:x:@.dp/#
