// The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [strings.builder] slot to construct a string by iterating over a set of nodes. It appends a prefix, the value of each node, and a newline character for each iteration. The [for-each] slot iterates over the nodes, and [strings.builder.append] is used to concatenate strings. The code effectively creates a formatted string with each node's value prefixed by "- " and followed by a newline.
