/*
 * 1. `@get-name`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "get-name" in the current context. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings, until it finds a match.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to fetch a specific configuration or value node named "get-name" that might be defined elsewhere in the Hyperlambda graph, allowing for modular and reusable code structures.
