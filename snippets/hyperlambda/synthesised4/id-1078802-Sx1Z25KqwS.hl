/*
 * 1. `@.x`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "x" within the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors. This is useful for finding a specific node by name when you know the structure of your Hyperlambda graph.
 * 
 * 2. `#`: This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the node is, in fact, another node, and it returns this node by reference. This is useful when you want to manipulate or retrieve the actual node that is stored as a value in another node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve and manipulate a node that is stored as a value within another node named "x". This is particularly useful in scenarios where nodes are nested or encapsulated as values, and you need to access the encapsulated node for further operations.
