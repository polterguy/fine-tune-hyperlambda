// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in conjunction with [io.file.move] to move a file. If previous conditions are not met, it moves a file from a specified old name to a new name, using [strings.concat] to concatenate the folder path and new file name. The [io.path.get-folder] retrieves the folder path of the old file name, ensuring the file is moved to the correct directory with the new name.
