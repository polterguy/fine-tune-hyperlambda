/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.dp` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for the node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for accessing a specific node that holds a reference or data needed for further processing.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the `.dp` node, treating it as a node itself. This is crucial when the value of a node is another node or a reference to another node, allowing you to work directly with the referenced node rather than its value as a string or other primitive type.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node obtained from the previous step. It is used to access the entire set of child nodes, which might contain multiple nodes of interest for further operations.
 * 
 * 4. `id` - This iterator filters the children nodes obtained from the previous step, returning only those nodes with the name `id`. This is useful when you need to perform operations specifically on nodes named `id`, such as retrieving their values or performing further processing.
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression might include scenarios where you need to gather or manipulate all `id` nodes within a specific data structure, such as collecting identifiers from a list of items or processing each `id` for further operations like validation or transformation.
