// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [neq] slot to compare the result of an HTTP GET request with the integer value 200. It checks if the status code returned from the HTTP GET request is not equal to 200, which typically indicates that the request was unsuccessful or did not return the expected result. The [neq] slot evaluates two arguments and returns true if they are not the same.
