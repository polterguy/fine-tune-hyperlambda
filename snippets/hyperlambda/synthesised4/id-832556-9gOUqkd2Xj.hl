 * This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database and reads from the "CustomerCustomerDemo" table.
 * It selects a distinct column, using an alias to rename it, and applies a "where" condition with an "and"
 * logical operator, although the specific conditions are not defined. The use of "distinct_functor" suggests
 * a focus on unique values in the selected column.
