// 1. `-`: This iterator retrieves the previous sibling of the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. It is used to navigate to the node that is directly above the current node, allowing you to access or manipulate its value or children. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to compare or aggregate data from adjacent nodes, or when you need to traverse the structure in a specific order.
