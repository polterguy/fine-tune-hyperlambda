/*
 * 1. `@lambda2json`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "lambda2json" from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and it will stop at the first match it finds. This is useful when you need to access a specific node directly by its name, especially if you know that the node exists and is unique within the current context. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Converting a Hyperlambda structure to a JSON format by accessing a node responsible for this transformation.
 * - Retrieving configuration or data stored under the "lambda2json" node for further processing or evaluation.
