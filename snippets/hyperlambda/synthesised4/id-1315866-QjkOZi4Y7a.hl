// The expression `unwrap:x:+/*/*/*/content` is used to evaluate and retrieve the values of all [content] nodes that are descendants of the node located three levels below the current node. The `+` iterator moves to the elder sibling of the current node, and the `/*/*/*/content` part navigates to the [content] nodes. This expression is useful for dynamically accessing and processing content data that is nested within a specific structure, allowing for flexible manipulation of hierarchical data in Hyperlambda.
