// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else-if] slot to check if the value of the [fruit] node is "strawberry". If the condition is true, it sets the value of the [category] node to "Berry". The [else-if] slot is used for conditional branching, allowing execution of the associated lambda block only if the preceding conditions are false and its own condition is true.
