// 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name, which in this case is "sql". It searches through the current node's siblings and ancestors to find the first occurrence of a node named "sql". This is useful for accessing specific nodes in a Hyperlambda graph when you know the node's name but not its exact location in the hierarchy.
