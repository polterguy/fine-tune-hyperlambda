// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that a specified argument, [group_column], is one of the predefined valid values. If the [group_column] is not one of the listed campaign-related fields, an exception is thrown. This validation is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that only allowed columns are used for grouping operations in SQL queries.
