// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement to perform conditional branching based on the value of a node. The [case] slot is used to define specific conditions to match against the value of the node being evaluated, allowing for different code execution paths depending on the matched case. The [switch] statement provides a structured way to handle multiple potential values for a node, improving code readability and maintainability.
