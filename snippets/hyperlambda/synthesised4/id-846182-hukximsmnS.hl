// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. When none of the preceding conditional branches (like [if] or [else-if]) evaluate to true, the [else] block is executed. In this example, the [add] slot is used within the [else] block to append a node with a name [primary] and a boolean value of false to the children of the [.tmp] node. This ensures that a default action is taken when no other conditions are met.
