/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes to a destination node. In this example, the [add] slot targets the [.urls] node as the destination. It then adds a new unnamed node with a value that is an expression pointing to the value of the [.url] node. This operation effectively appends the value of [.url] as a new child node under [.urls]. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - This slot appends nodes to the specified destination node.
 * 2. [.] - This unnamed node serves as a container for the node being added.
 * 3. [.:x:@.url] - This expression retrieves the value of the [.url] node to be added as a new child node under [.urls].
