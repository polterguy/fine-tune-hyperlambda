// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a block of code if previous conditions are not met. Within the [else] block, it uses [set-value] to change the value of the [.result] node by replacing occurrences of the string "[[search]]" with "false" using the [strings.replace] slot. This operation is performed only if none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions evaluate to true.
