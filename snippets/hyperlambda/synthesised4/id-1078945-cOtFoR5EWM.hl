 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before in its hierarchy that matches the given name. In this case, it looks for the first node named `tmp` in the current context.
 *    
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to access a specific node named `tmp` in a Hyperlambda structure, which might contain temporary data or configurations that need to be accessed or modified.
