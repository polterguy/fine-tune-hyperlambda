// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] slot to evaluate multiple conditions. It checks if an email address ends with '%gmail.com' using the [email.like] slot, which acts as a wildcard pattern matcher. The [and] slot will only evaluate to true if all its child conditions are true, making it useful for combining multiple logical checks.
