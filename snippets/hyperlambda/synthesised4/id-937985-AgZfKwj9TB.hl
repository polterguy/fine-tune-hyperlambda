// This Hyperlambda code snippet creates an information log entry using the [log.info] slot. It logs a message and associates it with a timestamp, both of which are retrieved from the [.log] node's children. The [log.info] slot is used for logging informational messages, and the children nodes provide additional metadata for the log entry.
log.info:x:@.log/*/message
   timestamp:x:@.log/*/timestamp
