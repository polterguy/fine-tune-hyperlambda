 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] from the current context. It's typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It's used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of [.arguments].
 * 
 * 3. `foreignField` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [foreignField] among the children of [.arguments]. It's used to specifically access the value of the [foreignField] argument if it exists.
