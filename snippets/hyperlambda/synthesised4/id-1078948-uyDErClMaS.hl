/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to navigate up the hierarchy to find the "arguments" node, which typically contains the parameters or arguments passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "arguments" node. It is used to access all the nodes that are direct children of "arguments", which usually represent individual arguments or parameters.
 * 
 * 3. `skip-auth` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "skip-auth". It is used to specifically find the "skip-auth" argument within the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to check if an "skip-auth" argument has been provided, which might be used to determine whether to bypass authentication processes in a function or endpoint.
