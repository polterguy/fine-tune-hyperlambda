/*
 * 1. `@http.post`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "http.post" in the current context. The `@` symbol is used to find a node by its name, and it will return the first match it encounters. This is useful in scenarios where you need to access or manipulate HTTP POST request data or configurations within a Hyperlambda script. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing the configuration or data related to an HTTP POST request in a web application.
 * - Modifying or inspecting the data being sent in an HTTP POST request before processing it further.
