// Performs an HTTP GET request to a URL constructed using [strings.concat] and automatically converts the response to a lambda object if the [convert] argument is set to true. [http.get] takes a URL as its value, and [strings.concat] is used to dynamically build this URL. The [convert] argument ensures the response is transformed into a structured format.
http.get:x:@strings.concat
