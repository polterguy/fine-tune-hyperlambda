// This Hyperlambda code counts the number of nodes resulting from a previous [strings.split] operation. It uses the [get-count] slot to determine how many nodes are present in the node set returned by the [strings.split] operation. The expression `@strings.split/*` points to all child nodes of the [strings.split] node, and [get-count] returns the total count of these nodes.
