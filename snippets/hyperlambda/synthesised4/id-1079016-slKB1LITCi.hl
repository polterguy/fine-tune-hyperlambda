/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node named "new-prompt" that is in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name. The `.` before `new-prompt` specifies that the search is limited to the current node's context, meaning it will not traverse siblings or children but will look for a direct match at the current level or higher up in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve a configuration or data node named "new-prompt" that is expected to be defined at the current level of the node hierarchy. This might be useful in scenarios where a specific node needs to be accessed for further processing or evaluation.
