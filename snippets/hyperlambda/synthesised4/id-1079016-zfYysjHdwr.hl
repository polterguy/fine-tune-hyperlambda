/*
 * 1. `@lambda2json` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "lambda2json" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to find a node named "lambda2json" to convert a Hyperlambda structure into a JSON format.
 * - It might be part of a larger process where the conversion of Hyperlambda to JSON is a required step, such as preparing data for an API response or logging.
