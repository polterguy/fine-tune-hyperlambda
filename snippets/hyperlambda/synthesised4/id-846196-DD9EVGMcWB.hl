/*
 * The code snippet adds a node structure under the [session] node. It creates a nested node with a [role] set to "assistant" and a [content] node whose value is dynamically set to the value of the [result] node. This is useful for organizing session data with specific roles and content. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts a new node structure into the [session] node.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the root of the new node structure being added.
 * 3. [.] - Represents a child node under the root node.
 * 4. [role] - Sets the role of the node to "assistant".
 * 5. [content] - Sets the content of the node to the value of the [result] node.
