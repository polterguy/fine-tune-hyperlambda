// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node is reached, allowing forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, it unwraps nodes using the expression [x:+/*/*], which evaluates the expression to retrieve nodes and their children, effectively processing nodes before reaching the destination node.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
