/*
 * 1. `@.words` - This iterator searches for the first node named "words" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for locating a specific node within a nested structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator. In this case, it will return all child nodes of the "words" node. This is useful for accessing or processing all elements within a specific parent node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * 
 * - This expression could be used to gather all words or elements under a "words" node in a document or data structure, which might be useful for text processing or analysis tasks.
 * - It could also be used in a scenario where you need to iterate over a list of words or items stored under a specific node to perform operations such as counting, filtering, or transforming these items.
