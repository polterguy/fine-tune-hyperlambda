// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to create a database transaction that deletes records from the "temp_data" table where the "created_at" date is less than January 1, 2020. The transaction is explicitly rolled back, ensuring that no records are actually deleted. The slots used are [data.transaction.create] to start a transaction, [data.delete] to specify the deletion operation, and [data.transaction.rollback] to cancel the transaction.
data.transaction.create
   data.delete
      table:temp_data
      where
         and
            created_at.lt:date:"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000"
   data.transaction.rollback
