// The Hyperlambda code defines a signal named [magic.http.scrape-url] which scrapes a URL for content. It retrieves the URL from a reference node and uses a boolean flag [semantics] set to true to possibly indicate semantic processing of the scraped content. The code is structured to dynamically extract and process web content based on the provided URL.
signal:magic.http.scrape-url
