/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the conversion of a JSON string into a lambda object using the [json2lambda] slot, and then converting it back to a JSON string using the [lambda2json] slot. The initial JSON string is provided as a value to the [.json] node, and the [json2lambda] slot processes this string to create a lambda object. Subsequently, the [lambda2json] slot takes this lambda object and converts it back into a JSON string. This process is useful for scenarios where JSON data needs to be manipulated or processed using lambda structures before being converted back to JSON format. 
 * 
 * 1. [.json] - Contains the JSON string to be converted.
 * 2. [json2lambda] - Converts the JSON string into a lambda object.
 * 3. [lambda2json] - Converts the lambda object back into a JSON string.
