/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It is useful when you need to locate a specific node by name within a complex node structure.
 * 2. `0` - This iterator retrieves the first child of the node found by the previous iterator. It is useful when you want to access the first element in a list or collection of nodes under a specific parent node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a specific configuration or setting within a structured data format where "hyper2lambda" is a known key or identifier.
 * - Retrieving the first item in a list of nodes under a specific category or grouping identified by "hyper2lambda".
