// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node is reached, allowing forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate the expression, resulting in the destination node having the value of the source node before it is reached. This is useful for preparing values in advance, especially when invoking lambda objects with expressions.
