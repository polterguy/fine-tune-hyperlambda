/*
 * This Hyperlambda code iterates over nodes from [data.read] and checks user roles against node-specific authorization requirements. If the user has the "root" role or no specific authorization is required, the node is added to [models]. Otherwise, it splits the authorization string, trims it, and checks if the user has any of the required roles, adding the node to [models] if conditions are met. The code uses slots like [for-each], [exists], [add], and [strings.split] to manage node access based on user roles.
 * 
 * 1. [for-each] - Iterates over nodes from [data.read].
 * 2. [or] - Checks if the user has the "root" role or if no specific authorization is required.
 * 3. [exists] - Verifies if the "root" role exists in the user's roles.
 * 4. [null] - Checks if the authorization node is null.
 * 5. [eq] - Compares the authorization node to an empty string.
 * 6. [add] - Adds the node to [models] if conditions are met.
 * 7. [strings.split] - Splits the authorization string by commas.
 * 8. [strings.trim] - Trims whitespace from split authorization strings.
 * 9. [and] - Checks if the user has any required roles and if the node type doesn't already exist in [models].
 * 10. [not-exists] - Ensures the node type isn't already in [models].
 * 11. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes to add to [models].
