/*
 * 1. `@.model`: This iterator searches for the first node named "model" within the current context, starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. 
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve configuration or settings stored in a "model" node that is defined higher up in the hierarchy.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to access a shared resource or configuration that is defined at a higher level in a nested structure.
