// This Hyperlambda code checks if a session argument exists, is not null, and is not an empty string. It uses the [and] slot to combine three conditions: [exists] to verify the presence of the session argument, [not-null] to ensure it has a non-null value, and [neq] to confirm it is not an empty string.
