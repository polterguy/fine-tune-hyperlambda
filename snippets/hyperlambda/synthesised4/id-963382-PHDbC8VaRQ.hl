// This Hyperlambda code deletes a record from the "users" table in a MySQL database where the "id" field equals 42. The [mysql.delete] slot specifies the table and the [where] clause defines the condition for deletion using the [and] slot to combine conditions, with [id.eq] ensuring the "id" matches the integer value 42.
mysql.delete
   table:users
