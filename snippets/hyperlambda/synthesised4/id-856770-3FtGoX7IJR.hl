// This Hyperlambda code snippet connects to a database and executes a SQL query to select specific columns from the "ml_training_snippets" table. It filters records based on the "type" and "id" parameters, ensuring the "embedding" column is null, and orders the results by "id", limiting the output to 20 records. The parameters "type" and "id" are dynamically set from the arguments.
data.select:"\nselect id, prompt, completion\n   from ml_training_snippets\n   where type = @type and id > @id and embedding is null order by id limit 20"
   type:x:@.arguments/*/type
   id:x:@.id
