/*
 * 1. `@.dp`: This iterator retrieves the first node named `.dp` from the current context. The `@` symbol is used to find the first node with the specified name, which in this case is `.dp`. This is useful when you want to access a specific node by its name within the current execution context.
 * 
 * 2. `#`: This iterator de-references the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the `.dp` node is another node, and it returns this node by reference. This is particularly useful when you need to modify the original node rather than working with a copy of it.
