// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each dynamically created slot using [for-each] and modifies each slot's [execute] node by setting its value to the current node's value and adding session nodes to it. It then executes the modified slot and checks if any nodes exist in the [execute] result, returning them if they do. The slots used are: [for-each], [set-value], [get-value], [add], [get-nodes], [execute], [if], [exists], and [return-nodes].
