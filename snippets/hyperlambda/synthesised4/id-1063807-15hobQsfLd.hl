/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator looks for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and traversing upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda file or endpoint, where input parameters are stored.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any parameter nodes that are direct children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `database` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `database` among the children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to specifically access the `database` argument, which might contain configuration or connection details for a database operation.
