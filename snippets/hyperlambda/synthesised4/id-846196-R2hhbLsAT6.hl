// The [type] slot returns the Hyperlambda type name of a specified value. In the example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer type and a value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to retrieve the type of the node's value, which will result in "int". This is useful for dynamically checking or verifying the data type of a node's value within a Hyperlambda script.
