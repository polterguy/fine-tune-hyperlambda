/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It's typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It allows you to access each argument passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `summarize` - This iterator filters the children nodes to find the first node with the name "summarize". It is used to specifically target the "summarize" argument within the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression is useful in a scenario where you need to access and manipulate the value of a specific argument named "summarize" that is passed to a Hyperlambda function or endpoint. For instance, it could be used to retrieve a text or data that needs to be summarized or processed further.
