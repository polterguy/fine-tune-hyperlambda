/*
 * 1. `@execute` - This iterator searches for the first node named "execute" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and their children, until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate data related to an "execute" operation, which might be a dynamically executed slot or a file execution.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "execute" node. It is used to access any data or nodes that are directly under the "execute" node, which might include arguments, results, or other relevant information.
 * 
 * 3. `result` - This iterator filters the children nodes of the "execute" node to find a node named "result". It is used to specifically target the outcome or output of the "execute" operation, assuming that the result of the execution is stored in a node named "result".
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This final iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "result" node. It is used to access detailed information or data points that are part of the result, which might include individual values, status codes, messages, or any other relevant data produced by the execution.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the detailed results of a dynamically executed slot or file, where the results are stored in a structured format under a "result" node.
 * - Accessing specific data points or values returned by an execution process for further processing, logging, or decision-making in a workflow.
