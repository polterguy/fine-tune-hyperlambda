// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses a [case] slot to check if a condition matches "wednesday". If it does, it sets the value of the [.activity] node to "Coding" using the [set-value] slot. This is typically used within a [switch] block to handle specific cases based on the evaluated condition.
case:wednesday
   set-value:x:@.activity
      .:Coding
