/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [lambda2hyper] slot to convert a lambda object located at [.session] into a Hyperlambda string representation. This can be useful for persisting the lambda object to a file or transmitting it over a network. 
 * 
 * 1. [lambda2hyper] - Converts the specified lambda object into a Hyperlambda string.
 * 2. [x:@.session/*] - Specifies the lambda object to be converted, in this case, all children of the [.session] node.
