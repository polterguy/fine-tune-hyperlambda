// The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [return-nodes] slot to return a set of nodes from a dynamically created slot or a context that supports returning nodes. It returns a [config] node with two child nodes: [retry] with an integer value of 3, and [timeout] with an integer value of 30. This structure is useful for returning configuration settings or structured data from a slot.
