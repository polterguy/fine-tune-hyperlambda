// The provided Hyperlambda code throws an exception with a custom message "Result too large, try to limit your result". It sets the HTTP status code to 400, indicating a client error, and marks the exception as public, allowing it to be propagated to the client even in release builds. The [throw] slot is used to generate this exception, with additional parameters [status] and [public] to control the HTTP response and visibility of the exception.
throw:Result too large, try to limit your result
   status:int:400
   public:bool:true
