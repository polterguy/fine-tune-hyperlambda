/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "result" in the current context. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate a specific node named "result" that might be a sibling or an ancestor of the current node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to fetch the value of a "result" node that holds the outcome of a computation or operation, allowing further processing or decision-making based on that result.
