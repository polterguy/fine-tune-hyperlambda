/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an HTTP endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any nodes that are direct children of `.arguments`.
 * 
 * 3. `webhook_outgoing` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `webhook_outgoing` among the children of `.arguments`. It is used to specifically access the `webhook_outgoing` node, which might contain data related to an outgoing webhook configuration or payload.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing the configuration or payload data for an outgoing webhook in an HTTP endpoint to process or modify it before sending the webhook.
 * - Validating or logging the outgoing webhook data by accessing its specific node in the arguments.
