// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name. This is useful when you want to retrieve a specific node within the current hierarchy, particularly when you know the exact name of the node you are interested in. The `.` before `sql` specifies that it should start the search from the current node's level or context. This is often used when working with SQL queries or commands stored within a node named "sql".
