// This Hyperlambda code connects to the "chinook" SQLite database and executes a SQL query to aggregate records for each artist. It selects the artist's name and the count of albums, grouping by artist ID, ordering by the count in descending order, and limiting the results to 25 records. The results are then returned as nodes.
