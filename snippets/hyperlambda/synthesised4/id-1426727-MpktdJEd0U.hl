// This Hyperlambda code checks if a specific node value does not exist in two different node sets and if it starts with a given URL. It uses [not-exists] to ensure the node value is absent in both [@.done] and [@.urls] node sets, and [strings.starts-with] to verify if the node value begins with the specified URL from the [.arguments] node.
