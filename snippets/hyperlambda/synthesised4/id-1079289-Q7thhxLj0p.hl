/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before in its hierarchy that matches the given name, which in this case is "sql". It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors up in the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is an ancestor of the current node, particularly when dealing with nested structures.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a SQL query or command stored in a node named "sql" somewhere up in the hierarchy, and you need to access it for execution or manipulation.
