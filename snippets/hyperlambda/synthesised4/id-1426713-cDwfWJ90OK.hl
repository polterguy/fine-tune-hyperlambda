/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve all nodes that are children of the [db_time] node, which is itself a child of the [result] node. The expression "@.result/*/db_time" specifies the path to the [db_time] node, starting from the current context. The [get-nodes] slot will return a node set containing all the nodes found at the specified path. 
 * 
 * 1. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes specified by the expression.
 * 2. [@.result/*/db_time] - Expression pointing to the [db_time] node under the [result] node.
