/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" within the current context. It starts from the current node and traverses upwards in the hierarchy if necessary to find the "arguments" node. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument node that is a direct child of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `subject` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "subject" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically access the "subject" argument if it exists.
