// The code uses the [strings.mixin] slot to embed the result of a [math.add] operation within a string. It calculates the sum of two integers, 2 and 2, and inserts the result into the string "The result is", resulting in "The result is 4". The [return] slot is used to output the result of the addition.
strings.mixin:@"The result is {{
math.add
