 * 1. `@load-file` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "load-file" in the current context. It is used to access a specific node within a Hyperlambda structure, often to load or reference a file node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda script to locate and interact with a node responsible for loading a file, possibly to execute or manipulate the file's content.
