// The code uses a [switch] statement to determine the MIME type based on the file extension. It checks for specific cases such as ".html", ".json", and ".txt", setting the [mime-type] node accordingly. If none of these cases match, the [default] case assigns a generic MIME type of "application/octet-stream". This ensures that the correct MIME type is set for known file extensions, while providing a fallback for unknown types.
