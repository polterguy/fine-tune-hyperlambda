// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the "name" node, which is a child of the node currently referenced by [.dp]. The [.dp] node is typically used in loops or iterators to reference the current node being processed. The expression navigates from [.dp] to its value, then to its children, and finally selects the "name" node to extract its value.
