/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is useful when you need to access nodes from the top level of your Hyperlambda structure, regardless of where the current execution context is within the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children of the root node. This is useful when you want to perform operations on or analyze all top-level nodes within your Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 3. `return` - This iterator filters the previous result set to return only nodes with the name "return". It is useful for identifying or operating on specific nodes that are intended to return values or results, often used in the context of dynamic slots or endpoint responses.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to gather all "return" nodes at the top level of a Hyperlambda file or dynamic slot, which can be useful for debugging or ensuring that all expected return paths are correctly defined.
 * - It can be used in a validation routine to ensure that a Hyperlambda script or slot has the necessary return statements, which might be crucial for the correct operation of the script.
