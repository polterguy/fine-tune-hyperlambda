// The code snippet demonstrates how to dynamically add nodes to a destination node using the [add] slot. It targets the [.session] node as the destination and appends a new node structure. Within this structure, a [.role] node is set to "user", and a [.content] node is populated with the value obtained from the [completion] node, which is referenced by the [.dp] node. This allows for dynamic modifications of the node graph based on the current execution context.
