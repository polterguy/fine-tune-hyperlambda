// The code snippet updates the value of a node named [shifted] within the [schedule] node by adding a time offset to a base value. It uses [math.add] to sum the value of [base] and a time span created with [time], which adds 1 day and 4 hours to the base value. The [set-value] slot assigns this computed result to the [shifted] node.
