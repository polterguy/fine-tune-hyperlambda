// This Hyperlambda code constructs a URL by concatenating a base URL with a URL-encoded query parameter. It uses [set-value] to assign the result to [.url], [strings.concat] to combine the base URL with the encoded query, and [strings.url-encode] to ensure the query parameter is safely encoded for URLs.
