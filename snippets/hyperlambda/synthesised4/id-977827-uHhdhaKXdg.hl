// This Hyperlambda code appends the value of the currently iterated node to the [full-content] node, followed by a newline character. It uses [strings.concat] to concatenate the existing value of [full-content] with the value of the current node, ensuring each addition is separated by a newline. The [set-value] slot then updates [full-content] with this new concatenated string.
