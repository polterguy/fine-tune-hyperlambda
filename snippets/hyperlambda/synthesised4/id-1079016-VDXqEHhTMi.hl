/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "result" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by its name. It will find the first occurrence of a node named "result" in the current hierarchy, starting from the current node and moving upwards if necessary.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieve the value of a result node after a computation or operation has been performed, such as the result of a mathematical operation or a processed data value.
 * - Access a result node to check its value for conditional logic, such as determining if a process was successful based on the result value.
