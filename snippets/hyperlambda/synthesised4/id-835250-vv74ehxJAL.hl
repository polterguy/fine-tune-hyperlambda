// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node it references is reached, allowing for forward evaluation. In this example, the expression [x:+/*/*] is unwrapped, meaning all nodes matching the expression will be evaluated before the [unwrap] node is processed. This is useful for pre-evaluating expressions in a lambda object.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
