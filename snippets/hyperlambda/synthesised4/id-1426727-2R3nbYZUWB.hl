// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is used with an expression to evaluate a node's value. The expression "+/**" indicates that it will evaluate the current node's elder sibling and all its descendants. This allows for the forward evaluation of expressions, making it useful when invoking lambda objects with expressions, as it ensures the expressions are evaluated before the lambda object is executed.
unwrap:x:+/**
