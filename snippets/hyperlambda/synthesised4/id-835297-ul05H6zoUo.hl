// The [case] slot is used within a [switch] statement to define a specific condition to match against the evaluated value of the [switch] node. If the value of the [switch] node matches the value of a [case] node, the corresponding block of code under that [case] is executed. The value of the [case] node can be of any type, including float, and must match the evaluated value of the [switch] node for the associated code block to run.
