// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [convert] slot to change the type of a node's value. It converts the value of the [recaptcha] node, which is located within the [data.read] node, to a decimal type. The [convert] slot takes an expression pointing to the target node and a [type] argument specifying the desired type conversion.
convert:x:@data.read/*/*/recaptcha
   type:decimal
