// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type name of a node's value. In the example provided, a node named [.foo] is declared with an integer value of 57. The [type] slot is then used with an expression pointing to the node above it, which retrieves the type name of the [.foo] node's value, resulting in the type name being "int". This is useful for dynamically determining the data type of a node's value within a Hyperlambda script.
