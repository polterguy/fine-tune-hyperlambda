// This Hyperlambda code uses the [auth.ticket.verify] slot to ensure that the currently authenticated user belongs to either the "root" or "admin" roles. If the user does not belong to any of these specified roles, an exception will be thrown, effectively preventing unauthorized access. This slot is typically used to secure endpoints by verifying user roles within an authenticated context.
