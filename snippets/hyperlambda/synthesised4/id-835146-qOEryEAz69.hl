// This Hyperlambda code checks if the node [embedding_vss] exists and has a value within the current node referenced by [.dp]. If the condition is true, it sets the value of [embedding_vss] to boolean true. The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, and [not-null] ensures the presence of a value before proceeding. The [set-value] slot modifies the node's value if the condition is met.
