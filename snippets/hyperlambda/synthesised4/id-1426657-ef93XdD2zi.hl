/*
 * This Hyperlambda code counts the number of nodes resulting from a [strings.split] operation. It first splits a string into multiple nodes based on a specified delimiter, and then uses [get-count] to determine how many nodes were created as a result of the split operation. 
 * 
 * 1. [get-count] - Returns the number of nodes its expression is pointing to, which in this case is the result of the [strings.split] operation.
 * 2. [strings.split] - Splits a string into multiple nodes based on a specified delimiter.
