 * // 2. [x:@.model/*/max_context_tokens] - This expression points to the node whose value will be set.
 * // 3. [get-value] - This slot retrieves the value of a node.
 * // 4. [x:@math.divide] - This expression points to the result of a [math.divide] operation, which is used as the new value for the specified node.
