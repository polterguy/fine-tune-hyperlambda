// The code checks if there are any child nodes under the node referenced by [.dp] using [exists]. If such nodes exist, it sets the value of [.warning] to a specific warning message using [set-value]. This message indicates that complex objects are present, and manual editing of expressions may be required.

         .:Warning, some of your actions, and/or arguments, are returning complex objects, and we cannot automatically create candidate expressions for these. You will have to manually edit some of your expressions if you want to reference these nodes in your actions.
