// This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.url-decode] slot to URL decode the second element of a node set obtained from a [strings.split] operation. The expression `@strings.split/1` is used to reference the second node in the result of the [strings.split] operation, and the [strings.url-decode] slot then decodes the URL-encoded string found at that node.
