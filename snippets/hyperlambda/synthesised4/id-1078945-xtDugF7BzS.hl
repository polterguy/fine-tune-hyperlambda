/*
 * 1. `..`: This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is useful when you need to access or manipulate the root node or its descendants from anywhere within the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it will retrieve all children of the root node.
 * 
 * 3. `.invoke`: This iterator retrieves nodes with the name ".invoke" from the previous result set. It is used to filter out nodes that are specifically named ".invoke".
 * 
 * 4. `*`: Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. Here, it will retrieve all children of the ".invoke" nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `while`: This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "while" from the previous result set. It is used to filter out nodes that are specifically named "while".
 * 
 * 6. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It will retrieve all children of the "while" nodes.
 * 
 * 7. `.lambda`: This iterator retrieves nodes with the name ".lambda" from the previous result set. It is used to filter out nodes that are specifically named ".lambda".
 * 
 * 8. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It will retrieve all children of the ".lambda" nodes.
 * 
 * 9. `http.post`: This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "http.post" from the previous result set. It is used to filter out nodes that are specifically named "http.post".
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression might include finding all HTTP POST requests that are made within lambda expressions inside while loops, which are themselves invoked from the root node. This could be useful for analyzing or modifying HTTP POST requests in a specific context within a Hyperlambda application.
