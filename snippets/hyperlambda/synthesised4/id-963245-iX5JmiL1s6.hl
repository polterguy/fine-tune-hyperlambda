// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each child node of [.data] using [for-each], and for each iteration, it retrieves all child nodes of the current node (using [get-nodes]) and appends them to the [.result] node using [add]. The [.dp] node holds a reference to the currently iterated node, allowing the code to dynamically manipulate and aggregate data into the [.result] node.
