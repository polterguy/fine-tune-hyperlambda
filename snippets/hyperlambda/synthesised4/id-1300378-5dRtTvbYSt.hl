// This Hyperlambda code is designed to read data from a SQLite database, specifically from the "Customers" table. The [data.read] slot is used to perform the read operation, and it specifies the database type as SQLite through the [database-type] node. The [table] node indicates that the operation targets the "Customers" table. Under the [columns] node, a list of columns from the "Customers" table is specified, including CustomerID, CompanyName, ContactName, and several others, which will be retrieved by the query. The [where] node is present but does not specify any conditions, implying that all records from the specified columns will be fetched without any filtering. Finally, the [return-nodes] slot is used to return the nodes resulting from the [data.read] operation, effectively outputting the retrieved data. This setup is useful for retrieving comprehensive customer information from a database without applying any filters.
