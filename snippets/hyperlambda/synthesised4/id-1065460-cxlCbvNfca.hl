/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name in the current context. In this case, it looks for the first node named `.arguments` in the current node hierarchy. This is useful for accessing specific nodes when you know their names and want to retrieve them directly without traversing the entire node structure.
 * 2. `.arguments` - This is the name of the node being targeted by the `@` iterator. It is typically used in Hyperlambda to define or access the arguments passed to a slot or an HTTP endpoint. This node usually contains the parameters or data that the slot or endpoint needs to process.
