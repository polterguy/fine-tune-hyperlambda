// The code snippet uses the [lambda2hyper] slot to convert a lambda object into a Hyperlambda string. The expression [x:@http.post] indicates that the conversion is applied to the lambda object resulting from an HTTP POST request. This allows the Hyperlambda representation of the HTTP POST request to be transferred or persisted.
lambda2hyper:x:@http.post
