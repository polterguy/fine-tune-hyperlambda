// This Hyperlambda code updates a record in the "ml_training_snippets" table by setting the "embedding" field to a specified value. It uses the [data.update] slot with a [values] argument to define the new value for the "embedding" field, and a [where] clause to ensure the update is applied only to the record with a matching "id". The [id.eq] condition ensures that only the intended record, identified by its "id", is updated.
