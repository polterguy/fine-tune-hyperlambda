// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate multiple strings into a single string. It combines the static strings "magic.db.", ".databases", and the value retrieved from the [get-value] slot pointing to the [.db-type] node. The result is a concatenated string that dynamically incorporates the value of [.db-type] between the static parts.
strings.concat
   .:magic.db.
   get-value:x:@.db-type
   .:.databases
