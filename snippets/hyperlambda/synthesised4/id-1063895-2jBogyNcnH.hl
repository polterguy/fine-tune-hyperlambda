/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by finding the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. This is often used to access the arguments passed into a Hyperlambda slot or function, as [.arguments] is a conventional node name for holding input parameters.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each individual argument node within the [.arguments] node. This is useful when you want to perform operations on or examine each argument provided to a slot or function.
 * 
 * 3. `columnType`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [columnType] from the previous result set, which is the children of [.arguments]. This is typically used to access a specific argument or parameter by name, in this case, the [columnType] argument, which might represent the type of a column in a database or data structure.
