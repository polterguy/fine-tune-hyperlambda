// This Hyperlambda code uses the [add] slot to append nodes to a destination node. It retrieves nodes from the expression [get-nodes:x:@data.select/*] and adds them to the children of the node referenced by [@.video-collection]. The [add] slot evaluates its children, allowing dynamic node addition.
