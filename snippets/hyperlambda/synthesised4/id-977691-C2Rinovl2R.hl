// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform an inner join between two tables, `cloudlets` and `clusters`, using the `join` slot. The join condition is specified using the `on` slot, where it checks for equality between the `cluster` column in the `cloudlets` table and the `id` column in the `clusters` table. This setup is useful for combining data from these tables based on matching values in the specified columns.
join:clusters

         cloudlets.cluster.eq:clusters.id
