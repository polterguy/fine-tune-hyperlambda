// The code uses the [validators.default] slot to ensure that if the [vectorize] node does not exist within the [.arguments] node collection, it is appended with a default value of false. If the node exists but has a null value, it sets its value to false. This ensures that the [vectorize] node always has a boolean value of false unless explicitly provided otherwise.
