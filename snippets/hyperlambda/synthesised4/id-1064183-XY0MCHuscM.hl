 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by searching for the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or a slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of [.arguments].
 * 
 * 3. `group_column` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [group_column]. It is used to specifically target the [group_column] node among the children of [.arguments].
