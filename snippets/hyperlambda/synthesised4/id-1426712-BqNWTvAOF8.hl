/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to set the value of nodes by converting the concatenated string values of their children nodes into a specified type. It uses the [set-x] slot to change the value of nodes referenced by the expression [./*/remove-nodes] to the result of a conversion operation. The conversion is performed by the [convert] slot, which takes the concatenated string values of the nodes as input through the [strings.concat] slot, and converts them into the type specified by the [type:x] declaration. This operation is useful for dynamically setting node values based on the concatenation and conversion of their children's values.
 * 
 * 1. [set-x] - Sets the value of nodes specified by the expression.
 * 2. [convert] - Converts the concatenated string values into a specified type.
 * 3. [strings.concat] - Concatenates the string values of the nodes.
 * 4. [type:x] - Specifies the type to which the concatenated string should be converted.
