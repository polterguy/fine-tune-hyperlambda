// This Hyperlambda code checks if a string does not start with "http://" or "https://". It uses the [and] slot to combine two [not] conditions, each using [strings.starts-with] to verify the absence of these prefixes in the specified string. The expression "@.dp/#/*/\@src/[0,1]" points to the string being evaluated.
