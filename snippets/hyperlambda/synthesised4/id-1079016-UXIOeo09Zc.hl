/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument individually.
 * 
 * 3. `prompt` - This iterator filters the children nodes of "arguments" to find the node named "prompt". It is used to specifically access the "prompt" argument from the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to retrieve the value of a "prompt" argument that has been passed to it. This is useful in scenarios where you need to process or manipulate the "prompt" argument within the function.
