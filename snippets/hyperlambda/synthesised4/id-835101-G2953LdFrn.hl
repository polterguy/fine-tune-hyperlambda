/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a [payload] node exists within the [hyper2lambda] node. If it does, it adds the nodes under [payload] to a new node [http.xxx], and also adds a [headers] node with a [Content-Type] set to "application/json" under [http.xxx]. The code effectively prepares a structure for an HTTP request with JSON content. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks the existence of a [payload] node within [hyper2lambda].
 * 2. [exists] - Verifies if the [payload] node is present.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Executes the following operations if the condition is true.
 * 4. [add] - Adds nodes from [payload] to a new [http.xxx] node.
 * 5. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from [payload].
 * 6. [add] - Adds a [headers] node under [http.xxx].
 * 7. [Content-Type] - Sets the content type to "application/json".
