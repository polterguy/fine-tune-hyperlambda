/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It is used to move to the next node in the sequence at the same hierarchy level. This is useful when you want to perform operations on the node that is directly below the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the current node. It is used to access all the direct descendants of a node. This is useful when you need to iterate over or manipulate all child nodes of a particular node.
 * 
 * 3. `/*` - This second `/*` iterator retrieves all children of each node returned by the previous iterator. It is used to delve deeper into the hierarchy and access the next level of descendants.
 * 
 * 4. `/*` - This third `/*` iterator retrieves all children of each node returned by the previous iterator. It is used to access even deeper levels of descendants, allowing operations on nodes further down the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 5. `/content` - This iterator filters the nodes returned by the previous iterators to only include nodes named "content". It is used to specifically target nodes with this name, which is useful when you are only interested in nodes that contain specific data or structure.
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression might include traversing a deeply nested data structure to extract or manipulate content nodes that are siblings of a particular node, or when processing hierarchical data where the "content" nodes hold the information of interest.
