// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, `tasks` and `users`, using the `user_id` column as the joining key. The join is aliased as `user_id` for clarity in the resulting dataset. The `on` condition specifies that the `user_id` from the `tasks` table must match the `user_id` from the `users` table.
