// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot to handle different datetime scenarios. It evaluates a datetime value and executes specific logic based on the matched case. The [case] slot allows for conditional branching based on the value of a datetime object, enabling the execution of different code paths depending on the datetime value. This is useful for executing specific logic based on different datetime conditions.
