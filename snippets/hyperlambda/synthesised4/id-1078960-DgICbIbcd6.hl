/*
 * 1. `@.filter-on-url`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "filter-on-url" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it should start the search from the current node's parent. This is useful when you want to apply a filter or perform an operation based on a specific node named "filter-on-url" that is expected to be a sibling or a direct child of the current node's parent.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to dynamically filter or process data based on a URL parameter or configuration setting that is represented by the "filter-on-url" node. For example, in a web application, it might be used to apply different logic or retrieve specific data depending on the URL path or query parameters.
