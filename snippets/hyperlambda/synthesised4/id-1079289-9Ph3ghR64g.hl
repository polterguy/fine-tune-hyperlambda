/*
 * This expression is a lambda expression used in Hyperlambda to navigate and retrieve specific nodes within a node structure. Here's a breakdown of each part of the expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@.columns`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "columns" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol is used to find nodes by name, and the `.` indicates that it starts the search from the current node's context.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "columns" node. The `*` symbol is used to access all direct children of a node.
 * 
 * Potential Use Cases:
 * - This expression can be used to iterate over all column definitions in a data structure, such as when dynamically generating a table or processing a list of columns in a database schema.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to apply operations or transformations to each column node within a "columns" parent node, such as formatting or validation tasks.
