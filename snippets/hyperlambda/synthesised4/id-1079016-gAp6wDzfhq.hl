/*
 * 1. `@.only-prompt`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "only-prompt" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node with the specified name, and the `.` indicates that it starts the search from the current node. This iterator is useful for directly accessing a specific node by name within the current context. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve a configuration or setting node named "only-prompt" within a larger Hyperlambda script, allowing for easy access and manipulation of its value or children nodes.
