/*
 * 1. `@.dp`: This iterator retrieves the first node named [.dp] within the current context. The `@` symbol is used to find a node by its name, and `.dp` specifies the exact name of the node to be retrieved. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that has been passed by reference, often used in loops or dynamic slot executions.
 * 
 * 2. `#`: This iterator de-references the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the [.dp] node is another node itself, allowing you to access or modify the original node directly. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to manipulate the node's value or its children directly, such as updating a node's value in a loop or when working with complex data structures.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression is commonly used in [for-each] loops where [.dp] represents the current node being iterated over. By de-referencing its value with `#`, you can directly modify or inspect the node's contents during each iteration.
