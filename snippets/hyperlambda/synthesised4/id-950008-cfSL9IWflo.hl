// This Hyperlambda code checks if a file path contains the string "/magic.startup/" and ends with ".hl". If both conditions are true, it executes the file using [io.file.execute]. The [if] slot evaluates the conditions using [and], which combines [strings.contains] and [strings.ends-with] to ensure both conditions are met before executing the lambda object. The [io.file.execute] slot is then used to execute the file specified by the path.
