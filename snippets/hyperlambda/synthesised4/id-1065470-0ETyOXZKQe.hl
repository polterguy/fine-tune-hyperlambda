// 1. `@.no` - This iterator searches for the first node named "no" starting from the current node and traversing upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first ancestor node with the name "no". This is useful when you need to access a specific ancestor node without knowing its exact position in the hierarchy, allowing you to dynamically reference nodes based on their names rather than their positions.
