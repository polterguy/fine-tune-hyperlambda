/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses logical conditions to evaluate nodes. It checks if the value of a node named "Default" is not equal to a given value, and combines this with checks on another node named "Extra" to see if it equals "auto_increment" or "DEFAULT_GENERATED". The [or] slot ensures that if any of these conditions are true, the entire expression evaluates to true. The [and] slot ensures both conditions inside it must be true for it to evaluate to true. The [not] slot negates the result of its child condition. 
 * 
 * 1. [or] - Evaluates to true if any of its child conditions are true.
 * 2. [and] - Requires all its child conditions to be true.
 * 3. [not] - Negates the boolean result of its child condition.
 * 4. [eq] - Checks for equality between two values.
 * 5. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a specified node.
