// This Hyperlambda code updates the value of the [max_context_tokens] node within the [.model] node by setting it to the result of a division operation. The [set-value] slot is used to change the value, while the [get-value] slot retrieves the result from a previously executed [math.divide] operation.
set-value:x:@.model/*/max_context_tokens
