/*
 * 1. `.`: This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the node hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node. It is useful for accessing all direct children nodes without filtering by name.
 * 
 * 3. `signal`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "signal" from the previously selected nodes. It is used to specifically target nodes with this name.
 * 
 * 4. `=`: This iterator filters nodes based on their value. In this case, it selects nodes with a value of "magic.ai.crawl-site" from the previously selected nodes. It is used to match nodes with a specific value.
 * 
 * 5. `*`: Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node. It is used to access all direct children of the nodes that matched the previous criteria.
 * 
 * 6. `type`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "type" from the previously selected nodes. It is used to specifically target nodes with this name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a web crawling or data extraction scenario where you need to identify and process specific signals related to the "magic.ai.crawl-site" within a larger data structure, and then further filter or manipulate data based on the "type" of those signals.
 * - It could also be useful in a logging or monitoring system where specific types of signals need to be extracted and analyzed for further processing or alerting.
