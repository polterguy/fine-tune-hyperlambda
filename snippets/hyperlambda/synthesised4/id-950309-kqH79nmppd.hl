// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [health] node is equal to "good" using the [eq] slot. If the condition is true, it executes the [.lambda] block, which sets the value of the [status] node to "OK". The [if] slot is used for conditional execution based on the result of the [eq] comparison.
