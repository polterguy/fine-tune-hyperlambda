// This Hyperlambda code uses the [data.select] slot to execute a SQL query on a database. It selects the "prompt" and the maximum "completion" from the "ml_requests" table, filtering records where "user_id" matches the provided argument, and both "questionnaire" and "context" are equal to 1. The results are grouped by the "prompt" field. The [user_id] argument is dynamically passed to the query from the [.arguments] node.
data.select:@"
select prompt, max(completion) as completion
   from ml_requests
   where user_id = @user_id and questionnaire = 1 and context = 1
   group by prompt"
   user_id:x:@.arguments/*/user_id
