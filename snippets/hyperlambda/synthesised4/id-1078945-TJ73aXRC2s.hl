 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator searches for the first node named `.session` within the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and their children, until it finds a node with the specified name. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving session data in a web application to access user-specific information.
 * - Accessing configuration or state information stored in a session node during a process execution.
