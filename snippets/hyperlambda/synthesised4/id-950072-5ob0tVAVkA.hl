// The code uses the [get-first-value] slot to return the first non-null value from a sequence of [get-value] slots. Each [get-value] slot attempts to retrieve a value from a specific index within the [.data] node, and [get-first-value] will stop and return the value from the first [get-value] that is not null. This is useful for providing default values or ensuring only a single value is returned.
