 * 1. `.` - Retrieves the parent node of the current node.
 * 2. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the parent node.
 * 3. `http.post` - Filters and returns all nodes named [http.post] among the parent's children.
 * 4. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of each [http.post] node.
 * 5. `payload` - Filters and returns all nodes named [payload] among the children of [http.post].
 * 6. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of each [payload] node.
 * 7. `messages` - Filters and returns all nodes named [messages] among the children of [payload].
 * 
 * The overall effect is to find all [messages] nodes that are children of [payload] nodes, which are themselves children of [http.post] nodes, where [http.post] nodes are siblings of the current node (i.e., children of the current node's parent).
