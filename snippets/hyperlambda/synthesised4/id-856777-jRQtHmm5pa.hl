// This Hyperlambda code uses the [and] slot to evaluate multiple conditions. It checks if a specific node does not exist in two different paths using [not-exists], and if the value of the current node, referenced by [.dp], starts with a given URL using [strings.starts-with]. If all conditions are true, the [and] slot will evaluate to true.
