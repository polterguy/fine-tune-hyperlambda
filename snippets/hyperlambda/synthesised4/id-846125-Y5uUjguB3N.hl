// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses logical conditions to evaluate an HTTP response status code. The [not] slot inverts the result of the [and] condition. The [and] slot checks if the HTTP status code is more than or equal to 200 using [mte] and less than 300 using [lt]. If both conditions are true, the [not] slot will return false, indicating the status code is within the 200-299 range, typically indicating a successful HTTP response.
