// The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [pgsql.create] slot to insert a new record into a PostgreSQL database. It specifies the table name as "users" and provides the values for the fields "name" and "email". The slot generates the necessary SQL statement to perform the insertion, ensuring protection against SQL injection by using parameterized queries. The values for "name" and "email" are passed as parameters, which are then used in the SQL statement.
pgsql.create
   table:users
   values
      name:Alice Smith
      email:alice@example.com
