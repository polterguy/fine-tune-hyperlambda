// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [convert] slot to change the type of the value obtained from a [strings.substring] operation. It specifies the conversion to a type defined by the [type] argument. Here, the conversion is to a type 'x', which might represent a custom type or a placeholder for demonstration purposes. The [convert] slot facilitates type conversion, ensuring compatibility with the desired type specification.
