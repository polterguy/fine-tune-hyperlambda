// This code snippet uses the [get-first-value] slot to retrieve the first non-null value from its children. It first attempts to get the value from the [placeholder] node within [.arguments]. If this value is null, it defaults to the static string "Ask me anything ...". This is useful for setting default values when a specific argument is not provided.
