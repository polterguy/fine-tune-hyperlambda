// This Hyperlambda code snippet updates the value of nodes referenced by the expression [@.scan/0/*/completion] using the [set-value] slot. It utilizes the [strings.mixin] slot to incorporate the result of a dynamic expression into the string, where the expression is derived from the [prompt] node located at [@.arguments/*/prompt]. This effectively allows for dynamic string manipulation based on the provided prompt argument.
