/*
 * 1. `@.snippets`: This iterator searches for the first node named "snippets" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "snippets" node it encounters. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is not a direct child but exists somewhere in the ancestor hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the node returned by the previous iterator. In this context, it will return all child nodes of the "snippets" node. This is useful when you want to perform operations on all children of a specific node, such as processing or transforming data contained within those children nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to gather all code snippets or data segments under a specific "snippets" node for further processing or analysis, such as compiling a list of code examples or aggregating data for a report.
