// The code snippet demonstrates how to convert a lambda object to a JSON string and set it as the value of a node. The [set-value] slot changes the value of the [.json] node to the result of the [lambda2json] slot, which converts the children nodes of [execute] into a JSON formatted string. This process allows for the serialization of a lambda structure into a JSON representation.
