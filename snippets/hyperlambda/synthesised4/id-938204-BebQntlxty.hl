// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else-if] slot in Hyperlambda. It checks if the value of the [number] node is equal to 6 using the [eq] slot. If the condition is true, it executes the [.lambda] block, which sets the value of the [output] node to "Six". The [else-if] slot is used for conditional branching, allowing execution of the [.lambda] block only if the preceding conditions are false and the current condition is true.
