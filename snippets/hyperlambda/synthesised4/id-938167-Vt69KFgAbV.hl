// This Hyperlambda code uses the [crypto.hash.sha384] slot to generate a SHA-384 hash of the data referenced by [.data]. The hash is returned in a "fingerprint" format, which is a human-readable representation of the cryptographic hash, suitable for use as a key reference in databases or for network transmission.
