/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator looks for the first node named "result" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It stops as soon as it finds the first match. This is useful when you need to retrieve a specific node that is expected to be an ancestor or a sibling in the current context, such as when you want to access a result node that holds a computed value or status from a previous operation or calculation. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to quickly access a result node that contains the outcome of a computation or a process, allowing subsequent operations to utilize this result without needing to traverse the entire node structure manually.
