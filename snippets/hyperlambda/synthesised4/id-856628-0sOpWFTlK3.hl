// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the name of all nodes referenced by the expression [@if/./*/data.execute] to "mssql.execute-batch". The [set-name] slot is used to rename nodes, and in this case, it targets nodes that are children of any node under an [if] node, specifically those named [data.execute].
set-name:x:@if/./*/data.execute
   .:mssql.execute-batch
