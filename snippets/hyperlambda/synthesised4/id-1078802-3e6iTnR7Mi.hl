/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name that appears before it in the hierarchy. In this case, it looks for a node named "response". It will search through the current node's siblings and, if necessary, move up the hierarchy to find the node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression is useful when you need to access or manipulate a specific node named "response" that is located somewhere above or at the same level as the current node in the hierarchy. For example, you might use this to update the value of a "response" node after processing some data or to check the status of a response in a larger workflow.
