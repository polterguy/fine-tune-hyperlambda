// The code snippet demonstrates a [while] loop that continues executing as long as the value of [.no] is less than 20. Within each iteration, it logs a message "Howdy from while" and increments the value of [.no] by 1 using [math.increment]. This loop effectively logs the message 20 times, starting from the initial value of [.no].
