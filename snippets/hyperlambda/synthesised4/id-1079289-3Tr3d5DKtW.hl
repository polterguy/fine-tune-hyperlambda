/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" that is an ancestor of the current node. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors up in the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate SQL-related data or configuration that is defined in a parent node, ensuring that you are always referencing the correct context for SQL operations.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a Hyperlambda graph that includes SQL configuration or queries defined at a higher level, and you need to access this information from a nested context to execute a database operation or to modify the SQL settings dynamically.
