// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to construct a SQL query using the [data.read] slot to read from a SQLite database. It specifies a left join between the "Treatments" and "Patients" tables, using "PatientID" as an alias. The query selects an aggregated column, aliases it as "result", and applies a "group by" clause on a specified column. The [where] clause is prepared for additional conditions to filter the results.
