// The code demonstrates the use of the [invoke] slot to execute a lambda object with arguments. It passes a "name" argument with the value "World" to the lambda, which likely manipulates or uses this argument in its execution. The [invoke] slot allows for argument passing and node returning, similar to dynamic slot invocations.
invoke:x:@.lambda
   name:World
