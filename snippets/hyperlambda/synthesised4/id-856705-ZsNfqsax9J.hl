// This Hyperlambda code replaces all newline characters in the value of the [.anchor] node with spaces. The [set-value] slot updates the [.anchor] node's value by using the [strings.replace] slot to perform the replacement operation. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the string to be replaced ("\n"), and the second is the replacement string (" ").
set-value:x:@.anchor
   strings.replace:x:@.anchor
      .:"\n"
