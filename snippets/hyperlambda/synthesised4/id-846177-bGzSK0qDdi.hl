// This code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda, which executes its child nodes if all preceding [if] and [else-if] conditions evaluate to false. Here, it uses the [add] slot to insert a node with the name [automatic] and a boolean value of false into the children of the nodes referenced by the expression [@.tmp/*].

   add:x:@.tmp/*
