/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a session argument exists, is not null, and is not an empty string. It uses [and] to ensure all conditions are true, [exists] to verify the presence of the session node, [not-null] to ensure it has a value, and [neq] to confirm the value is not an empty string.
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Ensures all conditions are true.
 * 2. [exists] - Checks if the session node exists.
 * 3. [not-null] - Verifies the session node has a value.
 * 4. [neq] - Confirms the session value is not an empty string.
