// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator looks for the first node named "sql" within the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node itself, until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful for retrieving configuration or query nodes that are named "sql" and are located somewhere in the hierarchy above the current node.
