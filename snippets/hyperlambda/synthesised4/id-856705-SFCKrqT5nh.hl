// This Hyperlambda code snippet decodes a URL-encoded string and assigns the result to a node. The [set-value] slot sets the value of the [.url] node to the decoded string obtained from the [strings.url-decode] slot. The [strings.url-decode] slot decodes the URL-encoded string found at the second position (index 1) of the result from the [strings.split] operation.
set-value:x:@.url
