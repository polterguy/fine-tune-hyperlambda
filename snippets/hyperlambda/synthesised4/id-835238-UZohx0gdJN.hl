// The code uses the [get-count] slot to return the number of nodes resulting from the [csv2lambda] conversion, which transforms a CSV string into a lambda object. The expression [x:@csv2lambda/*] points to all child nodes of the [csv2lambda] node, effectively counting how many nodes were generated during the CSV to lambda conversion process.
