// The code uses [strings.regex-replace] to remove all occurrences of a pattern matching numbers with commas from a specified node's value. The slot [strings.regex-replace] takes a regular expression as its first argument to identify the pattern and a replacement string as its second argument to replace the matched patterns. Here, the pattern "\\([0-9,]+\\)" is used to find numbers with commas, and it is replaced with an empty string, effectively removing it.
