/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by selecting the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a lambda function or an HTTP endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any nodes that are directly under the `.arguments` node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `prompt` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find the first node named `prompt`. It is used to specifically select a node with this name from the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a lambda function or an HTTP endpoint to retrieve the value of a `prompt` argument that has been passed in. This is useful in scenarios where the function or endpoint needs to process or respond to a specific prompt provided by the user or another system.
