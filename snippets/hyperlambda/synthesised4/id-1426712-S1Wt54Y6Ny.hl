// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot in Hyperlambda to determine and return the type of a node's value. In this example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer type and a value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to retrieve the type of the node's value, which will be "int" in this case. This is useful for dynamically checking and verifying the data types of node values within a Hyperlambda script.
