/*
 * The code snippet converts a lambda object to a JSON string and assigns it to the [.json] node. The [lambda2json] slot takes the result of the [execute] slot, which is assumed to be a lambda object, and transforms it into a JSON string. The [set-value] slot then updates the [.json] node with this JSON string. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the [.json] node.
 * 2. [lambda2json] - Converts a lambda object to a JSON string.
 * 3. [execute] - Assumed to provide the lambda object to be converted.
