// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a conditional check using [if] to compare two node values. It uses [lt] to determine if the value of [.lhs] is less than [.rhs]. If true, it sets [.result] to -1 using [set-value]. The snippet is typically used within a sorting context to establish order between two elements.
