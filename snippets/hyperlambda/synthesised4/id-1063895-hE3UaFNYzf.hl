// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it should search for a node with the specified name, and the `.` before `sql` means it should start the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you want to directly access a specific node by its name within the current scope, often used to retrieve a specific configuration or command node related to SQL operations.
