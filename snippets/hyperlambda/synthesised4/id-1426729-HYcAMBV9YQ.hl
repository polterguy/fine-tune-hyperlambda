// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [get-first-value] slot to retrieve the first non-null value from a series of potential values. It first attempts to get the value of a node named [title], then [description], and if both are null, it defaults to the static string "Page". This is useful for setting a default value when multiple potential sources might provide a value, ensuring only one non-null value is returned.
