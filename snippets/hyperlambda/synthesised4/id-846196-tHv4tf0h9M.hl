// This Hyperlambda code uses the [else] slot to execute a block of code when previous conditions are not met. It sets the value of the [prompt] node to the value retrieved from the [only-prompt] node using [set-value] and [get-value]. The [else] slot ensures this operation occurs only if preceding conditions are false.
