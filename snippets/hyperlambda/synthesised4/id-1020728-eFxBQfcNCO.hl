// 1. `@.final-message`: This iterator searches for the first node named "final-message" starting from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, and the `.` indicates that it will start the search from the current node's level. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name within the current context or hierarchy.
