// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to delete records from a Microsoft SQL Server database using the [mssql.delete] slot. It specifies the [table] as "projects" and uses a [where] clause with an [and] condition to filter records where the [status] field is equal to "archived". This ensures that only records with a status of "archived" are deleted from the "projects" table.
