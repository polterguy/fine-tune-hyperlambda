/*
 * 1. `@.fk`: This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which means it will look for the first node with the name "fk" in the current context. The `.` following the `@` indicates that it will start its search from the current node's parent. This is useful when you want to reference a sibling node or a node that is at the same level in the hierarchy as the current node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve a foreign key value in a database-related context, where "fk" is a sibling node containing the foreign key information needed for further processing or validation.
