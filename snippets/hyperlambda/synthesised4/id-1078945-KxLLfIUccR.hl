/*
 * 1. `@.iterations`: This iterator finds the first node with the name "iterations" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts searching from the current node's position and moves upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node named "iterations". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve a counter or loop control variable named "iterations" that is defined in a parent or sibling node, which might be used to control the number of times a loop executes or to track the number of iterations completed in a process.
