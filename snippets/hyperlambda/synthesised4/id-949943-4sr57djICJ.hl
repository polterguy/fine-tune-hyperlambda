// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [if] slot in Hyperlambda to evaluate a condition. When the condition evaluates to true, the [set-value] slot is executed to change the value of the [.dest] node to "condition met". This illustrates a basic conditional execution where the [if] slot checks a boolean condition and executes its associated lambda block if the condition is satisfied.

   .:bool:true
   .lambda
      set-value:x:@.dest
