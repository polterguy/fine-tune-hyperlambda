// This Hyperlambda code connects to the "chinook" SQLite database and selects distinct customer details for those listening to rock music. It performs multiple inner joins across tables like Customer, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, and Genre to filter records where the genre name is "Rock". The results are ordered by the customer's email and returned as nodes.
