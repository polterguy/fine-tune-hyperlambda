// 1. `@.fields`: This iterator searches for the first node named "fields" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "fields" node it encounters. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name that is located somewhere above the current node in the hierarchy, and you are certain there is only one such node or you only need the first occurrence.
