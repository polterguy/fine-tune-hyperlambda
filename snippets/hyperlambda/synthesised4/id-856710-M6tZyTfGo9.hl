// The `log.timeshift` slot is used to adjust the timestamps of log entries. In this example, it targets log entries with the content "User successfully authenticated", allowing for the modification of their timestamps to reflect a different time, which can be useful for aligning logs across different systems or correcting time discrepancies.
log.timeshift:User successfully authenticated
