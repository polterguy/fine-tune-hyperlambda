/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy. It is used to locate the [.arguments] node, which typically contains input parameters or arguments for a function or endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access the individual argument nodes that are direct children of the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "session" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically target the "session" node among the arguments, which might contain session-related data or identifiers.
