/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to navigate to the topmost node in the current context, which is useful when you need to access or modify nodes at the root level or when you want to ensure that your operations start from a known point in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it will retrieve all children nodes of the root node. This is useful for iterating over or accessing all direct descendants of the root node.
 * 
 * 3. `return` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "return" from the previous result set. It is used to specifically target nodes named "return" among the children of the root node, which could be useful for operations that need to handle return values or outputs in a Hyperlambda script.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to find and process all "return" nodes at the root level of a Hyperlambda script, perhaps to modify their values or to perform some validation or logging on return values.
