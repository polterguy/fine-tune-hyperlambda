/*
 * This Hyperlambda code adds nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot to a specific location. The [get-nodes] slot fetches nodes from the path specified in its expression, and the [add] slot inserts these nodes into the path specified in its expression. The code effectively moves nodes from one part of the graph to another, specifically from [signal/*/snippets/*] to [../*/return/*/references]. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts nodes into the specified location in the graph.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the specified path in its expression.
