/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the HTTP response headers based on the file type. It uses a [switch] statement to determine the Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers for different file types, such as PDF, ZIP, and TXT. If the file type doesn't match any specified case, it defaults to application/octet-stream with a generic filename. The [response.headers.set] slot is used to configure these headers for each case.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Evaluates the file type to determine the appropriate response headers.
 * 2. [case:pdf] - Sets headers for PDF files with application/pdf and a filename of "document.pdf".
 * 3. [case:zip] - Configures headers for ZIP files with application/zip and a filename of "archive.zip".
 * 4. [case:txt] - Sets headers for TXT files with text/plain and a filename of "notes.txt".
 * 5. [default] - Applies default headers for unspecified file types with application/octet-stream and a filename of "file.bin".
 * 6. [response.headers.set] - Sets the Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers for each file type.
