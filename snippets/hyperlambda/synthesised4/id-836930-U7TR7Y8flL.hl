// This Hyperlambda code sets an HTTP response header to control caching behavior. The [response.headers.set] slot is used to specify the "Cache-Control" header with a value of "public, max-age=300", which instructs clients and intermediate caches to store the response for 300 seconds before revalidating it. This is useful for optimizing performance and reducing server load by allowing cached responses to be reused.
