// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] statement to define a specific case condition. When the [switch] statement is evaluated, it checks each [case] condition sequentially. If a [case] condition matches the value being evaluated by the [switch], the code within that [case] block is executed. This allows for efficient branching based on multiple potential values of a single expression, similar to switch-case constructs in other programming languages.
