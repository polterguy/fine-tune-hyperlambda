/*
 * 1. `@lambda2html`: This iterator searches for the first node named "lambda2html" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks through its siblings and ancestors to find a node with this specific name. 
 * 
 * Use case: This expression could be used to locate a node that is responsible for converting lambda expressions to HTML, perhaps as part of a templating or rendering system where lambda expressions are transformed into HTML content for web pages.
