// This Hyperlambda code snippet extracts a substring from the value of the [.file-data] node. It starts the substring at index 1 and calculates the length of the substring by subtracting 2 from the total length of the [.file-data] string. The [strings.substring] slot is used to achieve this, with the starting index and the calculated length provided as arguments.
strings.substring:x:@.file-data
