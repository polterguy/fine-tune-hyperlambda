/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "session" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings. This is useful for accessing session-related data that might be stored in a node named "session" within the current context or any parent context. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing session variables or data in a web application to maintain state across different requests.
 * - Retrieving user-specific information stored in a session node for personalized processing or decision-making.
