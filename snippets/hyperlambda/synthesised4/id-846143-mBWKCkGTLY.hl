/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [case] slot to handle different scenarios based on the value of the "User-Agent" HTTP header. The [switch] slot is used to evaluate the "User-Agent" value, and depending on its content, different actions are executed within each [case] block. The [default] slot provides a fallback action if none of the specified cases match the "User-Agent" value. This structure allows for flexible handling of HTTP requests based on the client's user agent string.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Evaluates the "User-Agent" HTTP header to determine which case to execute.
 * 2. [case] - Defines specific actions for different "User-Agent" values.
 * 3. [default] - Provides a fallback action if no cases match the "User-Agent" value.
