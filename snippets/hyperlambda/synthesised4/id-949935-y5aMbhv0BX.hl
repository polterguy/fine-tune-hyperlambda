// This Hyperlambda code evaluates if an applicant is eligible for approval based on two conditions: their age must be 21 or older, and their country must be the USA. If both conditions are met, it sets the eligibility status to "Approved". The [if] slot checks these conditions using [and] to ensure both are true, with [mte] comparing age and [eq] checking the country.
