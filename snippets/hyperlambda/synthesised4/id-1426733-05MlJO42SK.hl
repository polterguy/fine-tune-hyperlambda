/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type name of a node's value. The code sets a node [.foo] with an integer value of 57, and then uses the [type] slot to obtain the type of the node's value, which will be "int".
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type name of the value of the node above it, which is "int".
