// This Hyperlambda code checks if a given string does not start with either "http://" or "https://". It uses the [and] slot to combine two [not] conditions, each using [strings.starts-with] to evaluate the string. If both conditions are true, it indicates the string does not start with the specified prefixes. The expression "@.dp/#/*/\@src/[0,1]" is used to reference the string being evaluated.
