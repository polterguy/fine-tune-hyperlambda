// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to update records in a SQLite database table named "CustomerDemographics" using the [data.update] slot. The [database-type] slot specifies the database type as SQLite, while the [table] slot indicates the target table. The [values] slot is intended to hold the columns and their new values for the update operation. The [where] clause, combined with [and], is used to specify conditions for selecting which records to update, ensuring that only specific records are modified.
