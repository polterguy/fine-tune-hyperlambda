// The code snippet demonstrates a [while] loop that continues executing as long as the value of [.sum] is less than 100. Within the loop, it updates [.sum] by adding the current value of [.no] to it, and then increments [.no] by 1. The loop effectively accumulates the sum of sequential numbers starting from the initial value of [.no] until [.sum] reaches or exceeds 100.
