// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate a complex lambda expression, which navigates through multiple levels of child nodes to retrieve the 'name' node. The [unwrap] slot ensures that the expression is evaluated before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing the 'name' node's value to be utilized in subsequent operations.
