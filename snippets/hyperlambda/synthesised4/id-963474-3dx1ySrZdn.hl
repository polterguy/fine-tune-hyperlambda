// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [return-nodes] slot in Hyperlambda to return a set of nodes from a dynamically created slot or a context that allows returning nodes. It returns three nodes: [name] with the value "Jane Doe", [age] with an integer value of 35, and [country] with the value "Norway". This is useful for returning structured data from a slot.
