 * 1. `@` - This iterator is used to find the first node with the specified name. In this case, it looks for the first node named `.sql` within the current context. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors up in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve a SQL query or command stored in a node named `.sql` within a Hyperlambda graph, which might be used for executing a database operation or for logging purposes.
