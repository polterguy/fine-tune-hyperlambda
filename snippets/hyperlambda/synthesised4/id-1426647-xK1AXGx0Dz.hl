/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.x] to a concatenated string. The concatenation is performed using the [strings.concat] slot, which combines the value of the current node (referenced by [@]) with the value retrieved from the node named [node-name]. The result is then set as the new value for the node referenced by [@.x].
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates a list of strings into one string.
 * 3. [@] - Refers to the current node's value.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node its expression is pointing to.
 * 5. [@.node-name] - Expression pointing to the node named [node-name] to retrieve its value.
