/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. This is often used to access the arguments node in Hyperlambda, which typically contains input parameters for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are directly under [.arguments].
 * 
 * 3. `group_column` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named [group_column] from the previously retrieved children of [.arguments]. This is typically used to access a specific argument named [group_column] that is expected to be passed into the function or endpoint.
