/*
 * 1. `@.finish_reason`: This iterator looks for the first node named `finish_reason` that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to determine the reason for the completion of a process or task, by fetching the `finish_reason` node's value from the current context.
