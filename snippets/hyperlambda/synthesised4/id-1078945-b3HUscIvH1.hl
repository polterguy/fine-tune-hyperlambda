/*
 * 1. `@.invoke`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "invoke" that is encountered in the hierarchy, starting from the current node and moving upwards. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. This is useful for accessing a specific node named "invoke" that might be part of a larger structure, such as when you need to access or modify parameters or settings related to an invocation process within a Hyperlambda script. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or parameters related to a function call or operation encapsulated within an "invoke" node.
 * - Modifying or retrieving data associated with an "invoke" operation in a dynamic script execution environment.
