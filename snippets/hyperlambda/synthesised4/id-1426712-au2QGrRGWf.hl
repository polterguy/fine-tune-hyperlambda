// This Hyperlambda code sends a signal to a specified session using the [sockets.signal] slot. It transmits a JSON object containing an error status, an integer status code of 500, and a message indicating that there have been too many function invocations, suggesting to configure the type to handle more invocations or change the prompt. The signal is intended to notify subscribers of an error condition in the system. The slots used in this code are: [sockets.signal] to send the signal, [args] to specify the arguments for the signal, [error] to indicate an error condition, [status] to provide the status code, and [message] to convey the error message.
