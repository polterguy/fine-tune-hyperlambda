 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] and [get-value] slots to manipulate node values. 
 * // It retrieves the content of a specific node within an HTTP POST response and assigns it to a different node.
 * // The [set-value] slot changes the value of the node specified by its expression, while the [get-value] slot retrieves the value of a node specified by its expression.
 * // 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * // 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression.
