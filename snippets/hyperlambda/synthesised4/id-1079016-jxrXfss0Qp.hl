/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "result" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, and the `.` indicates that it will search within the current context or scope. 
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is useful when you need to retrieve the value of a node named "result" that is expected to be in the current context, such as when checking the outcome of a computation or operation that stores its result in a node named "result".
