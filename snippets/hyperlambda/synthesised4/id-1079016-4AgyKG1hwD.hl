/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It is often used to access the root node of the arguments passed into a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `references` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "references". It is used to specifically target nodes with this name among the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access a specific "references" node within the arguments of a Hyperlambda slot or function. It is useful when you need to manipulate or retrieve data from a node specifically named "references" that is passed as part of the arguments.
