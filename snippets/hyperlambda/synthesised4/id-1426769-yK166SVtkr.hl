 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append a new node to a collection of nodes. The [add] slot takes an expression pointing to a node set as its main argument, and adds the specified children nodes to this node set. In this example, a new node with a value derived from the [type] node is added to the collection located at [.tmp]. The [type] node's value is retrieved using an expression, and this value is then used as the value for the new node being added.
 * // 
 * // 1. [add:x:@.tmp/*] - This slot appends a new node to the collection of nodes located at [.tmp].
 * // 2. [hl:x:@.type] - This node retrieves the value from the [type] node and uses it as the value for the new node being added.
