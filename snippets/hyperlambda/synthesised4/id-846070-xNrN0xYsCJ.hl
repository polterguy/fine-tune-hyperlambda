// The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of a node specified by its expression. In this example, the expression navigates through the node hierarchy to find the first child node of the [src] node, which is a child of the current node's value, and returns its value. The expression uses complex navigation to pinpoint the exact node from which to extract the value.
