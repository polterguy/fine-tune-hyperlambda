/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you want to navigate upwards in the hierarchy to access or manipulate the parent node's data or structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is commonly used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing you to iterate over or manipulate them.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes named "data.read". It is used to specifically target nodes with this name, which might represent a specific operation or data structure in the context.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Similar to the previous `*`, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.read" nodes. It allows you to access further nested structures or data within the "data.read" nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `columns` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes named "columns". It is used to focus on nodes that likely represent a collection or definition of columns, possibly in a data table or similar structure.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "columns" nodes. It is used to access individual column definitions or data within the "columns" node.
 * 
 * 7. `distinct_functor` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes named "distinct_functor". It is used to specifically target nodes that might represent a function or operation related to ensuring distinct or unique values, possibly in a data processing context.
