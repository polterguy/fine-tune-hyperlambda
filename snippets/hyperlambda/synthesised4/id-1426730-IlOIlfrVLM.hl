/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type of a node's value. The [type] slot is used to return the Hyperlambda type name of a specified value. In this example, a node named [.foo] is declared with an integer value of 57. The [type] slot is then invoked with an expression pointing to the node above it, which returns the type of the [.foo] node's value, which is "int". 
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value.
 * 2. [type] - Returns the type of the node's value.
