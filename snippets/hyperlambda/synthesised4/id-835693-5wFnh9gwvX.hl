// The Hyperlambda code performs a SQL read operation on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "documents" table. It includes a left join with the "clients" table, aliased as "client_id", based on matching "client_id" fields. The query selects a distinct count of a functor, aliasing the result as "count". A "where" clause is prepared for additional conditions, though none are specified in the provided code.
