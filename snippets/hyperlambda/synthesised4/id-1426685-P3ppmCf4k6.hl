/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet evaluates whether the type of a node specified in the arguments is equal to a given type. The [and] slot ensures that all conditions within it must be true for the overall expression to evaluate to true. The [type.eq] slot checks if the type of the node matches the specified type. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Ensures that all conditions within it must be true.
 * 2. [type.eq] - Checks if the type of a node matches the specified type.
 * 3. [x:@.arguments/*/type] - Specifies the node whose type is being checked.
