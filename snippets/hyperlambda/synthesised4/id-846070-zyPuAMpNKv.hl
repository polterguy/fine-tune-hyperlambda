// The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of a node specified by its expression. In this example, it navigates through a complex path using various iterators to reach the desired node. The expression starts by referencing the [.dp] node, then de-references its value using [#], retrieves all children nodes with [*], filters by name with [\\@src], and finally selects a subset of nodes with [0,1].
get-value:x:"@.dp/#/*/\\@src/[0,1]"
