/*
 * 1. `@.crawl-delay`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "crawl-delay" that is a sibling or a direct ancestor of the current node. It starts its search from the current node's position in the hierarchy and moves upwards or sideways to find the specified node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to fetch a configuration or setting related to web crawling, such as a delay value that specifies how long a crawler should wait before making another request to the server. This could be useful in web scraping or SEO tools to respect the server's load and avoid being blocked.
