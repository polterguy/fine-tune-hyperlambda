/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node with the specified name, and the dot `.` signifies that it should look in the current node's context or hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node found in the previous step. It expands the search to include every direct child node under `.arguments`.
 * 
 * 3. `max` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `max` from the children nodes retrieved in the previous step. It effectively narrows down the search to nodes specifically named `max` under the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * This expression is useful for retrieving a node named `max` that is a child of the `.arguments` node, which could be part of a larger structure where `.arguments` holds various parameters or settings, and `max` represents a specific parameter or value of interest.
