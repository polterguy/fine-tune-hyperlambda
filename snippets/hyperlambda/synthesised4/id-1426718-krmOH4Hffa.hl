// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and retrieve the value of a node located at a specific path in a node structure. The expression "x:+/*/*/message" navigates to the desired node, and [unwrap] ensures that the value is evaluated before the node is reached, allowing for dynamic evaluation of expressions within the node graph.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/message
