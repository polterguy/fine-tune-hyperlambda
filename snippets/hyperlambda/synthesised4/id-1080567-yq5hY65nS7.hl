/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with this specific name. The `.` before `sql` indicates that it is looking for a node at the current level or above, not among siblings or descendants. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve a SQL query or command stored in a node named "sql" within a Hyperlambda graph. This might be useful in scenarios where you are dynamically constructing or executing SQL commands and need to access the SQL statement at runtime.
 * - It could also be used in a validation or debugging process to ensure that a SQL node exists and contains the expected value before proceeding with database operations.
