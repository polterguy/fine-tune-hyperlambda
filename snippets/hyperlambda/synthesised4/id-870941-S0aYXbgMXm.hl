// The code checks if the user has a "root" role using [auth.ticket.in-role]. If true, it performs several operations: it adds nodes from [execute-file] to an [output] node, calculates the time difference between the current date and a stored time using [math.subtract], and sends a signal [sockets.signal] to "magic.workflows.action" with the role "root", including the calculated time and output as arguments.
