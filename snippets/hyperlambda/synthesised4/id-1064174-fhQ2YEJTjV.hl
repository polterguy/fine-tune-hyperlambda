/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda structure, which often contains parameters or input data for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "arguments" node. It allows you to access any parameter or data node that is a direct child of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `/offset` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "offset" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically access the "offset" parameter or data within the arguments, which might be used for operations like pagination or data slicing.
