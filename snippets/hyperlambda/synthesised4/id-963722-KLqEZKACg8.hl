// The code snippet demonstrates the creation of an RSA keypair using the [crypto.rsa.create-key] slot with a specified key strength of 2048 bits. This operation generates a public and private key pair suitable for cryptographic services, with the strength parameter determining the security level of the keys. The default strength is 2048 bits, which balances security and performance for general use.
