/*
 * 1. `@.extra-tokens`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "extra-tokens" that is a sibling or a child of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that the search is for a node with a specific name. The `.` before "extra-tokens" implies that the search starts from the current node's context. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve a node named "extra-tokens" that might contain additional data or configuration settings relevant to the current context, such as extra parameters or metadata needed for further processing.
