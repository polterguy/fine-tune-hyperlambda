// This Hyperlambda code snippet converts a lambda object into a Hyperlambda string using the [lambda2hyper] slot. The expression [x:@http.post] indicates that it targets the [http.post] node, converting its structure into a Hyperlambda textual representation. This is useful for transferring or persisting the lambda structure as a string.
