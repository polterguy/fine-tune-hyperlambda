// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a PostgreSQL database using the [data.read] slot. It specifies the table "fishes" and selects the columns "species" and "habitat". The [where] clause filters records to include only those with a "habitat" value of "Freshwater". The [limit] slot restricts the result set to 5 records. This setup allows for efficient querying of specific data subsets from a PostgreSQL database.
