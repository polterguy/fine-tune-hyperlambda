// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] slot in Hyperlambda to evaluate multiple conditions. Here, it checks if the [habitat] node has a value of "Freshwater". The [and] slot is typically used to ensure that all child conditions are true before executing the subsequent logic. In this case, the logic would proceed only if the [habitat] condition is met.
