// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of the substring "hansen" with "tjobing hansen" in the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.full-name]. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the substring to be replaced, and the second is the new substring that will replace the first one.
strings.replace:x:@.full-name
   .:hansen
   .:tjobing hansen
