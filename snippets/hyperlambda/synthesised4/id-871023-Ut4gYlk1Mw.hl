// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds nodes dynamically to the [headers] node. It uses the [add] slot to append nodes, where the destination is determined by the expression [x:+/*/headers], pointing to the [headers] node. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node under [headers], which are then added to the [headers] node. This allows for dynamic modification of HTTP headers based on arguments.
add:x:+/*/headers
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/headers/*
