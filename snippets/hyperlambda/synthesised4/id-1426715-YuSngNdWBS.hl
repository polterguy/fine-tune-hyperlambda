/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add a new node to an existing node set using the [add] slot. The [add] slot takes an expression pointing to a node and adds a new child node to it. In this example, the [add] slot is used to add a new node with the name [model_size] and the integer value 16384 as a child to the node pointed to by the expression [x:@.model]. The purpose of this operation is to dynamically extend the node structure by adding additional information or attributes to an existing node.
 * // 1. [case:gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613] - Root node of the Hyperlambda snippet, possibly indicating a specific case or context.
 * // 2. [add:x:@.model] - Adds a new child node to the node pointed to by the expression [x:@.model].
 * // 3. [.] - Represents the new child node to be added.
 * // 4. [model_size:int:16384] - The new child node being added, with the name [model_size], type [int], and value 16384.
