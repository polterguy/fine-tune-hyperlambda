/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet checks for equality between two nodes' values. It compares the value of the [prompt] node within the [data.read] node's children against the value of the [prompt] node within the current node being iterated by reference, denoted by [.dp]. If both values are identical, the [eq] slot will return true, indicating that the two prompt values are equal.
 * // 1. [eq] - Checks for equality between two values.
 * // 2. [get-value:x:@data.read/*/*/prompt] - Retrieves the value of the [prompt] node within the [data.read] node's children.
 * // 3. [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/prompt] - Retrieves the value of the [prompt] node within the current node being iterated by reference.
