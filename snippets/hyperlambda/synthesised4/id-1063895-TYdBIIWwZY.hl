/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot, especially in a Hyperlambda context where arguments are often encapsulated within an `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any node that is a direct child of `.arguments`, regardless of its name.
 * 
 * 3. `databaseType` - This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes named `databaseType`. It is used to specifically target and retrieve the node that holds the value for `databaseType`, which is likely an argument or configuration parameter within the `.arguments` node. 
 * 
 * This expression is used to access the value of a specific argument named `databaseType` within a Hyperlambda structure, typically to determine the type of database being referenced or used in the context.
