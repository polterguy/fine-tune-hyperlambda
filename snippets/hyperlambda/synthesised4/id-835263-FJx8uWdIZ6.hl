// The code snippet demonstrates how to dynamically add nodes into a destination node using the [add] slot. It retrieves nodes from a sorted list using [get-nodes] and appends them to the children of the current node's elder sibling. The [add] slot's primary argument specifies the destination, and it evaluates its children before adding them to the destination's children collection.
