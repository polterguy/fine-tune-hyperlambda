/*
 * 1. `@auth.token.verify` - This iterator starts by locating the first node named `auth.token.verify` in the current hierarchy. It searches for this node starting from the current node and moving upwards and sideways in the hierarchy until it finds a match. This is useful for accessing a specific node that might be part of a larger structure related to authentication or token verification.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `auth.token.verify` node. It is useful when you need to process or evaluate all child nodes under a specific parent node, especially when the structure or number of children is dynamic or unknown.
 * 
 * 3. `email` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find the node named `email`. It is used to specifically target and work with the `email` node, which might contain an email address or related information necessary for further processing or validation.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in an authentication system to verify if a token contains a valid email address, which is often required for user identification or authorization processes.
 * - It could also be used in a logging or monitoring system to extract and log the email address associated with a particular token verification event.
