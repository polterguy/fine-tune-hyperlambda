/*
 * 1. `@data` - This iterator searches for the first node named "data" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node with the name "data". This is useful when you want to reference a specific node by name without traversing the entire node structure manually.
 * 
 * 2. `create` - This part of the expression is not an iterator but rather the name of the node or slot that is being referenced. In this context, it suggests that the expression is looking for a node named "create" that is a child of the "data" node. This is useful for accessing specific child nodes or slots under a known parent node.
