// 1. `@whitelist` - This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context that has the name "whitelist". It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a match. This is useful for accessing configuration or settings nodes that are named "whitelist" and are located somewhere in the hierarchy above the current node. A potential use case could be checking if a certain value or node is part of a predefined list of allowed items or configurations.
