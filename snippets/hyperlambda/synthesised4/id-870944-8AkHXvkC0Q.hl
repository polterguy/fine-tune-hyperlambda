/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert nodes into a specified location within a node structure. The code adds a new node structure containing [url], [title], and [snippets] nodes to the node set referenced by the expression in the [add] slot. The [url] and [title] nodes are populated using values retrieved from a referenced node, while [snippets] is added as an empty node.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts nodes into the specified location within the node structure.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the node structure to be added.
 * 3. [url] - Retrieves and sets the URL value from a referenced node.
 * 4. [title] - Retrieves and sets the title value from a referenced node.
 * 5. [snippets] - Adds an empty node named "snippets".
