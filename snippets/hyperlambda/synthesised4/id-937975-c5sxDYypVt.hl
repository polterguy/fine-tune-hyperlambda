// The code demonstrates the use of the [if] slot in Hyperlambda to conditionally execute a block of code. It checks if a boolean condition evaluates to false, and if so, it sets the value of the [.dest] node to "yup!". The [if] slot requires two arguments: a condition and a [.lambda] block, which is executed only if the condition is true.
if
   .:bool:false
   .lambda
      set-value:x:@.dest
         .:yup!
