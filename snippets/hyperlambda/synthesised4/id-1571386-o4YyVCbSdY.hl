 * 1. The first iterator "+" retrieves the next sibling node (the node immediately following the current node at the same indentation level).
 * 2. The second iterator "*" retrieves all children nodes of the next sibling node.
 * 3. The third iterator "*" retrieves all children nodes of each child node found in the previous step.
 * 
 * The overall effect is to return all grandchildren (children of children) of the next sibling node of the current node.
