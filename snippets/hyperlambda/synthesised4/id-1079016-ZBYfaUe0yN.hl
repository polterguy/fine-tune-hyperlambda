/*
 * 1. `@.fixed`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "fixed" that is found before the current node in its hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it should start the search from the current node's parent. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node and has a known name. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a configuration or settings node named "fixed" that you need to reference from various points in your Hyperlambda code, ensuring consistent access to its data.
