// This Hyperlambda code connects to a MySQL database named "sales_db" and retrieves the latest 10 transactions ordered by transaction date in descending order. It uses the [data.connect] slot to establish the connection and [data.select] to execute the SQL query. The results of the query are then added to a node named [result] using the [add] slot.
data.connect:sales_db
   database-type:mysql
   data.select:select * from transactions order by transaction_date desc limit 10
      database-type:mysql
   add:x:@.result
