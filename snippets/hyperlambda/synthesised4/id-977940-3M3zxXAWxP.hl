// The [unwrap] slot in this Hyperlambda code is used to evaluate expressions before the node is reached. It takes an expression as its value, which in this case is "+/*/**", and evaluates it to produce a result. The expression "+/*/**" is a complex lambda expression that traverses nodes, and the [unwrap] slot ensures that this traversal and evaluation happen before the node where [unwrap] is used is executed.
unwrap:x:+/*/**
