/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot, especially in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints where arguments are defined under an `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access all argument nodes that are direct children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `session`. It is used to specifically access the `session` argument, which might contain session-related data such as user session information or session tokens.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a session token or session-related data passed as an argument to a function or an HTTP endpoint.
 * - Retrieving user session information for authentication or authorization purposes within a dynamic slot or endpoint.
