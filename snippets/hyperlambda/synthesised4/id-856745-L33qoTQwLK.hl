// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [lt] slot to compare the token count of a text, obtained via [openai.tokenize], against a threshold of 5000. It returns true if the token count is less than 5000. [openai.tokenize] calculates the number of tokens the text at [.tmp] would consume from OpenAI endpoints. [lt] performs the comparison, ensuring the token count stays within the specified limit.
