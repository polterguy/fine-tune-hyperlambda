/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by its name, and the `.` indicates that it will start the search from the current node's parent. If the "sql" node is found, it returns this node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve a SQL query or command stored in a node named "sql" for execution or manipulation.
 * - It might be part of a larger expression to check or modify the contents of a SQL-related node within a Hyperlambda script.
