/*
 * 1. `@.function-result`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "function-result" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` before it specifies that the search should start from the current node's parent. This means it will look for a sibling node named "function-result" that is at the same level as the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve the result of a function execution that has been stored in a sibling node named "function-result". This might be useful in scenarios where you need to use or manipulate the outcome of a previously executed function within the same context.
