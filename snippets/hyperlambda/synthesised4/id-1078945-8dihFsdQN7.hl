/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by finding the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol is used to search for a node by name, and the dot before `arguments` indicates that it is a child node of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `.arguments` node. The asterisk (`*`) is used to select all children, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `/type`: This iterator filters the previously selected nodes to only include those with the name `type`. It narrows down the selection to nodes specifically named `type` among the children of `.arguments`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to extract the `type` information from a set of arguments passed to a function or endpoint. For example, it might be used in a validation process to ensure that the correct data types are being used for each argument.
 * - Another use case could be in a logging or debugging context, where you want to capture and log the types of arguments being processed to understand better how a system or application is being used.
