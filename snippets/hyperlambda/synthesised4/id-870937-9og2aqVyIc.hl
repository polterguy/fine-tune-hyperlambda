/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of [else], [set-name], [unwrap], and [add] slots in Hyperlambda. It changes the name of certain nodes, evaluates expressions to unwrap values, and appends nodes to a specified location. The [else] slot ensures that the enclosed operations occur when previous conditions are not met, while [set-name] and [get-name] are used to dynamically rename nodes. [unwrap] evaluates expressions before execution, and [add] appends nodes to a target node set.
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes the enclosed operations if previous conditions are false.
 * 2. [set-name] - Changes the name of nodes to the value obtained from [get-name].
 * 3. [get-name] - Retrieves the name of the node referenced in its expression.
 * 4. [unwrap] - Evaluates expressions before reaching the node.
 * 5. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified destination node set.
