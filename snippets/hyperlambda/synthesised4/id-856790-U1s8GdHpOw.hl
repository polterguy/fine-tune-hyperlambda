/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [remove-nodes] slot to remove specific child nodes from a node set. It targets nodes with a name of "db" and a value matching "master", "tempdb", "model", or "msdb" within a [signal] node structure. This is useful for cleaning up or filtering out specific database nodes in a Hyperlambda graph.
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Begins a conditional block for the "mssql" case.
 * 2. [remove-nodes] - Removes nodes with a "db" name and a value of "master" from the [signal] node.
 * 3. [remove-nodes] - Removes nodes with a "db" name and a value of "tempdb" from the [signal] node.
 * 4. [remove-nodes] - Removes nodes with a "db" name and a value of "model" from the [signal] node.
 * 5. [remove-nodes] - Removes nodes with a "db" name and a value of "msdb" from the [signal] node.
