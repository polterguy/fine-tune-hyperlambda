// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to append a structured data node to a lambda object. It targets the children of the [lambda2hyper] node within the [.lambda] node. The appended data structure, named [timeshifts], contains multiple categories such as [logins], [access_denied], [openai_success], [openai_failure], and [lead_generated], each with a [name], [description], and an empty [items] node, presumably for tracking various events or metrics.
