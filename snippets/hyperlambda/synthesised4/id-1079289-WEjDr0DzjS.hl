/*
 * 1. `@.no` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no" that is an ancestor or a sibling of the current node in the hierarchy. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to check for the existence or retrieve the value of a node named "no" that is logically related to the current node, possibly indicating a negative condition or a flag in the context of the data structure.
