// 1. `@.database-type`: This iterator searches for the first node named "database-type" within the current node's hierarchy, starting from the current node and moving upwards. It is useful when you need to access a specific configuration or setting that is defined higher up in the node hierarchy, such as determining the type of database being used in an application.
