// This Hyperlambda code snippet takes an HTML string stored at [.tmp-prompt], converts it to Markdown using the [html2markdown] slot, and stores the result in [.snippets] as a new node with [prompt] and [completion] as its children. The [prompt] node contains the original HTML, and the [completion] node contains the converted Markdown.
