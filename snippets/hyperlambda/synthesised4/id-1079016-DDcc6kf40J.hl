/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves to the next node below the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the node immediately following the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. After moving to the elder sibling with the `+` iterator, this retrieves all child nodes of that sibling. It is useful for accessing or iterating over all children of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of each node in the previous result set. After retrieving the children of the elder sibling, this retrieves all children of those children, effectively accessing the grandchildren of the elder sibling.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to access and manipulate data in a hierarchical structure where you need to move to the next node and then perform operations on its descendants, such as processing a list of items and their sub-items in a configuration or data file.
