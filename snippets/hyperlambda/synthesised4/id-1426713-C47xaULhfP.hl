/*
 * The code snippet uses the [not] slot to negate the boolean value of the result obtained from the [get-value] slot. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression, which in this case is the [references] node under the [.arguments] node. The [not] slot then negates this boolean value, effectively inverting its truthiness. 
 * 
 * 1. [not] - Negates the boolean value of its child node.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [references] node under the [.arguments] node.
