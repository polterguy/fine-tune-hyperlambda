// This Hyperlambda code attempts to verify if the currently authenticated user has the "superuser" role using the [auth.ticket.verify] slot. If the verification is successful, it sets the value of the [result] node to "Superuser access granted" using the [set-value] slot. If the user does not have the required role, an exception will be thrown, and the [set-value] slot will not be executed.
