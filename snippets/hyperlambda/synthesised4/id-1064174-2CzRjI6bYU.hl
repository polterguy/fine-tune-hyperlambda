 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all children nodes of the parent node retrieved by the previous iterator.
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "data.read". It is used to specifically target nodes named "data.read" among the children of the parent node.
