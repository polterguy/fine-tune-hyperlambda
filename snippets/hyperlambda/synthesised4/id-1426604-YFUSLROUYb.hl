// This Hyperlambda code snippet is part of a conditional branching structure. It uses the [else] slot to set the value of the [scheme] node to "https" if none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are met. This ensures that the [scheme] node defaults to "https" when all other conditions are false. The [else] slot does not require a condition to be specified, and its actions are executed directly as its child nodes.
