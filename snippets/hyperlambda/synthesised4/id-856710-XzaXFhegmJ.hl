/*
 * The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add a node structure under a specified path using the [add] slot. It targets the [modules] node within the [lambda2hyper] node, which is a child of the [lambda] node. The added structure includes a [foo] node, which itself contains two child nodes: [loc] and [files]. These child nodes use expressions to reference values from the current context. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node structure under the specified path.
 * 2. [x:@.lambda/*/lambda2hyper/*/modules] - Expression targeting the [modules] node within the [lambda2hyper] node, which is a child of the [lambda] node.
 * 3. [.] - Represents the root of the new node structure being added.
 * 4. [foo] - A node under the root of the new structure.
 * 5. [loc:x:@.loc] - A child node of [foo] that references a value from the current context.
 * 6. [files:x:@.files] - Another child node of [foo] that references a value from the current context.
