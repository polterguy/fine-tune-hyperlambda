/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of a switch-case structure to evaluate a text embedding model. It checks the value of [model] and executes the corresponding case block, logging the model's name. The [switch] slot evaluates the [model] node, and the [case] slots define different model names to match against. If no match is found, the [default] slot logs a message indicating an unknown model.
 * 
 * 1. [model] - Declares the model name to be evaluated.
 * 2. [switch] - Initiates a switch-case structure based on the [model] node's value.
 * 3. [case] - Matches specific model names and executes the associated block.
 * 4. [log.info] - Logs the model name or an unknown model message.
 * 5. [default] - Executes if no [case] matches, logging an unknown model message.
