/*
 * This Hyperlambda code replaces every character in the string obtained from the [get-name] slot that is not found in the specified set of characters (lowercase letters, digits, and underscore) with an underscore. It effectively sanitizes the string to contain only allowed characters by replacing disallowed ones with underscores. The slots used are as follows: 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.replace-not-of] - Replaces characters not in the specified set with a given character.
 * 2. [get-name] - Retrieves the name of the current node.
