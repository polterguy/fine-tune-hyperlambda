// The code establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database using the [pgsql.connect] slot, first connecting to a generic "postgres" database to execute a SQL statement that creates a new database named "magic". It then connects to the newly created "magic" database and executes a SQL statement loaded from a file using the [io.file.load] slot. This sequence facilitates the creation and setup of a PostgreSQL database environment.
