/*
 * 1. `@.model`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "model" starting from the current node's context. It looks for a node named "model" among the siblings and ancestors of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "model" node. It returns every child node directly under the "model" node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access and manipulate all child nodes of a "model" node in a data structure, which might represent different attributes or properties of a model in a machine learning context.
 * - It could be used to iterate over configuration settings or parameters stored under a "model" node in a configuration file or data structure.
