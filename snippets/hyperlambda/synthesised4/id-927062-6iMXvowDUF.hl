// This Hyperlambda code uses the [validators.regex] slot to ensure that the value of the [name] node within the [.arguments] node matches a specific regular expression pattern. The pattern enforces that the name consists of 2 to 20 characters, which can include lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. If the value does not match this pattern, an exception will be thrown.
