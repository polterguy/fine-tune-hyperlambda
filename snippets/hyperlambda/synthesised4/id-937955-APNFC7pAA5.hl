// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] slot to evaluate a condition where the product_id is equal to 202. The [and] slot requires all its child conditions to be true for it to evaluate to true. Here, it checks if the product_id is exactly 202 using the [eq] slot, which performs an equality comparison.
