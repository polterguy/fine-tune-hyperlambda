// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] to the current node's children. It fetches nodes from the [.arguments] node, specifically [order] and [direction], and adds them as children to the node specified by the [add] slot's expression. This allows for dynamic modification of the node structure by incorporating specific argument nodes.
