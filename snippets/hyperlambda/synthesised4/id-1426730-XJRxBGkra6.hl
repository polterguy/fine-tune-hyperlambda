/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes to a specific location in a Hyperlambda graph. It uses the [add] slot to insert nodes at a position determined by the expression provided. The [get-nodes] slot is used to retrieve a list of nodes from a previously sorted list, and these nodes are then added to the specified location. The process involves manipulating the node structure by adding nodes from a sorted list to a new position, effectively modifying the graph's hierarchy.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts nodes at a specific location in the Hyperlambda graph.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from a previously sorted list to be added.
