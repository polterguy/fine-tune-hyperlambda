/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to access the arguments node, which typically contains parameters or data passed to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected "arguments" node. It is used to access any parameter nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `folder` - This iterator filters the previously selected nodes to only include those with the name "folder". It is used to specifically target the "folder" parameter within the arguments, allowing the expression to extract or manipulate its value.
