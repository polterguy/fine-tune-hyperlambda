/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It is used to navigate to the next node below the current one in the Hyperlambda structure. This can be useful when you want to access or manipulate the node immediately following the current node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. After moving to the elder sibling with the `+` iterator, the `*` iterator will gather all child nodes of that elder sibling. This is useful for operations that need to process or evaluate all children of a specific node.
