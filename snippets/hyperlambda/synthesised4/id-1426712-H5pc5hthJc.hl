// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [get-count] slot to count the number of child nodes under the [.session] node. The expression `x:@.session/*` points to all children of the [.session] node, and [get-count] returns the total number of these child nodes. This is useful for determining how many items or elements are present within a specific node in a Hyperlambda graph.
get-count:x:@.session/*
