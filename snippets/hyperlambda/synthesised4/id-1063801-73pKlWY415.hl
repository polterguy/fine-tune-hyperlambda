/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument individually.
 * 3. `message` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "message" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically access the "message" argument if it exists.
