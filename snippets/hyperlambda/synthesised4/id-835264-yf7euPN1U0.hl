// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes. It adds nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] from the [headers] node within [.arguments] to the [signal] node. The [add] slot takes the nodes from the [get-nodes] expression and appends them to the specified target node, which is [signal] in this case.
