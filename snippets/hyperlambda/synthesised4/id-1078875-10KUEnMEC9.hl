/*
 * 1. `@.folder`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "folder" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will stop as soon as it finds the first matching node. This is useful when you need to reference a specific ancestor node named "folder" in your Hyperlambda structure, perhaps to access its value or its children nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or settings stored in a parent "folder" node.
 * - Retrieving data or metadata associated with a "folder" node that is relevant to the current context.
