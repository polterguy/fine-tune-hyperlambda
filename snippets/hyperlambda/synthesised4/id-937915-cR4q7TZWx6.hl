// The code iterates over each file in a directory using [for-each] and deletes them with [io.file.delete]. The [for-each] slot iterates through the list of files returned by [io.file.list], and for each file, [io.file.delete] is invoked to remove it. The [.dp] node in [io.file.delete] refers to the current file being iterated, ensuring each file is deleted.
