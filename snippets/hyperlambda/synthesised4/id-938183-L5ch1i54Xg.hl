// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [convert] slot to change the type of a node's value. It converts the value of the current node to a "node" type. The [convert] slot takes an expression pointing to the node to be converted and a [type] argument specifying the desired type. This operation is useful for transforming data types within a Hyperlambda structure.
