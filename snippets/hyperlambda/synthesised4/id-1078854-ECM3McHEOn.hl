 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context with the specified name that follows the "@" symbol. In this case, it looks for the first node named "models" in the current context. It does not traverse siblings but looks for the node in the current hierarchy level or above.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving configuration settings or parameters stored under a node named "models".
 * - Accessing a specific data structure or collection of items labeled as "models" within a larger dataset or configuration.
