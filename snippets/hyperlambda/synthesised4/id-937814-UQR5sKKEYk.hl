// This Hyperlambda code uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node. It targets the node referenced by [.dp] and updates its value to "processed". The [set-value] slot is used to modify the value of nodes, and the expression [x:@.dp/#] ensures the node is accessed by reference, allowing the original node to be altered directly.
