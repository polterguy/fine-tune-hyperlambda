// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database and executes two SQL delete statements. The first statement deletes rows from the "vss_ml_training_snippets" table where the "rowid" matches the "id" from the "ml_training_snippets" table, filtered by the "type" and "uri" conditions. The second statement deletes rows directly from the "ml_training_snippets" table based on the same "type" and "uri" conditions. The "type" and "uri" values are dynamically retrieved from the arguments and a specified URI, respectively.
