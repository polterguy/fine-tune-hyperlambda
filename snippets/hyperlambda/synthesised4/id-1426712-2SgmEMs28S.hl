// This Hyperlambda code snippet evaluates a logical condition using the [or] slot. It checks two conditions: first, if the [stream] node within the [.arguments] node does not exist using [not-exists], and second, if the value of the [stream] node is equal to false using [eq]. The [or] slot will evaluate to true if either of these conditions is true, meaning that either the [stream] node is absent or its value is explicitly false. This logic is useful for determining if a stream is not available or is explicitly set to false.
