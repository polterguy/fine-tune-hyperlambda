// The code snippet demonstrates how to convert a lambda object into a Hyperlambda string using the [lambda2hyper] slot. It takes a lambda object, specified by the expression in its value, and transforms it into a Hyperlambda string representation. This can be useful for transferring Hyperlambda code to another server or for persisting it to disk. The example shows the conversion of a lambda object located at the [http.post] node.
