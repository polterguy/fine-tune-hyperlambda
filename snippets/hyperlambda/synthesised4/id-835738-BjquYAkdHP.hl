// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, [unwrap] is applied to the next sibling node, ensuring the value is evaluated and assigned before execution continues. This is particularly useful when dealing with expressions that need to be resolved in advance, allowing for dynamic value assignment and manipulation within the lambda object.
