// This Hyperlambda code creates a scheduled task named "sqlite.create-backup" that runs every day at 1 AM UTC. The task connects to a database, checks if a backup file exists, deletes it if it does, creates a new backup of the database, flushes cached connections, and logs the backup creation. The [tasks.create] slot is used to define the task, [data.connect] establishes the database connection, [if] checks for the file's existence, [io.file.delete] removes the existing backup, [sqlite.backup] creates a new backup, [sqlite.connections.flush] clears cached connections, and [log.info] logs the operation.
