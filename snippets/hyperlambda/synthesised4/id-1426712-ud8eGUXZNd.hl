/*
 * /*
 *  * This Hyperlambda code is a logical construct that evaluates multiple conditions using the [and] slot. It checks if a node named [data] exists within the children of the [.arguments] node, if this [data] node is not null, and if its value is not equal to an empty string. The [and] slot ensures that all these conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true.
 *  * 1. [and] - Combines multiple conditions and evaluates to true only if all conditions are true.
 *  * 2. [exists:x:@.arguments/*/data] - Checks if a node named [data] exists within the children of the [.arguments] node.
 *  * 3. [not-null:x:@.arguments/*/data] - Checks if the [data] node is not null.
 *  * 4. [neq:x:@.arguments/*/data] - Checks if the value of the [data] node is not equal to an empty string.
