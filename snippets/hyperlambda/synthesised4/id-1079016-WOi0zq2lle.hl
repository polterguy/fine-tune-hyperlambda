/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which means it will search for the first node with the name "result" in the current context. The `.` following the `@` indicates that it should look for this node starting from the current node's parent, moving upwards through the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for accessing a specific node named "result" that might be a sibling or a parent of the current node. 
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - Accessing a result node that contains the output of a previously executed operation.
 * - Retrieving a status or outcome stored in a node named "result" after a series of computations or logical operations.
