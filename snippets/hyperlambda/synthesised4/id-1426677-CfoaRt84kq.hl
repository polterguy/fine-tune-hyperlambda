/*
 * This Hyperlambda code creates a scheduled task that deletes a chatbot 7 days after its creation. It sends a signal to a feedback channel, sleeps for a short duration, calculates the future date for deletion, and constructs a task name. The task is created with a description and due date, and it performs several operations: deleting records from a database, deleting a file, logging the deletion, and finally deleting the task itself. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if the [.auto_destruct] node is true.
 * 2. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to a feedback channel with a message about creating a scheduled task.
 * 3. [sleep] - Pauses execution for 100 milliseconds.
 * 4. [math.add] - Calculates the date 7 days from now.
 * 5. [strings.concat] - Constructs a task name by concatenating strings.
 * 6. [unwrap] - Evaluates expressions to retrieve the task and type nodes.
 * 7. [tasks.create] - Creates a task with a description and due date.
 * 8. [.lambda] - Defines the operations to be executed by the task.
 * 9. [.type] - Retrieves the type of the chatbot.
 * 10. [data.connect] - Connects to a database and executes a SQL delete statement.
 * 11. [.task] - Retrieves the task name.
 * 12. [data.delete] - Deletes a record from the database.
 * 13. [strings.concat] - Constructs a file path for deletion.
 * 14. [io.file.delete] - Deletes a file at the specified path.
 * 15. [log.info] - Logs information about the deletion of the chatbot.
 * 16. [tasks.delete] - Deletes the task after execution.
