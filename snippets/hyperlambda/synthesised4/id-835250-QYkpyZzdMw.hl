// The code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes into a specific location within a node hierarchy. It uses the [add] slot to insert nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] into a destination specified by a complex lambda expression. The [get-nodes] slot fetches all child nodes of [result], and the [add] slot appends these nodes into the [snippets] node, which is located within a nested structure defined by the expression. This operation allows for dynamic modification of the node graph by adding existing nodes to a new location.
