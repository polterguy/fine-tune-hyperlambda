// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] slot with a comparison operator [field1.neq] to check if the value of 'field1' is not equal to 'xxx'. The [and] slot requires all its child conditions to be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. Here, it is used to combine multiple conditions, with [field1.neq] specifically checking for inequality.
and
   field1.neq:xxx
