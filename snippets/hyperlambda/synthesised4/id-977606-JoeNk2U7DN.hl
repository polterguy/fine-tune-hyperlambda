 * The provided Hyperlambda code iterates over the first five nodes resulting from splitting a string, unwraps each node to evaluate its expressions, and appends the evaluated result to a node named [.words]. 
 * 
 * 1. [for-each] - Iterates over the first five nodes from the result of a [strings.split] operation.
 * 2. [unwrap] - Evaluates expressions within each iterated node.
 * 3. [add] - Appends the evaluated result to the [.words] node.
 * 4. [.] - Represents the value of the currently iterated node.
