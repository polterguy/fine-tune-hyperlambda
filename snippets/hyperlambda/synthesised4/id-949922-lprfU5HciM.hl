// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates a try-catch block where an exception is thrown with a public visibility and a status code of 123. The [try] slot initiates the block, and the [throw] slot raises the exception. The [public] node ensures the exception is visible to the client, and the [status] node sets the HTTP status code to 123.
