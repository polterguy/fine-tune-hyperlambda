// The [get-first-value] slot returns the first non-null value from the nodes specified by its expression. In this case, it evaluates the nodes in the parent directory of the current node, filtering for nodes named [.src], and returns the first non-null value among them. This is useful for obtaining a default or fallback value when multiple potential sources are available.
