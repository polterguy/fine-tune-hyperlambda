/*
 * 1. `@crypto.rsa.create-key` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "crypto.rsa.create-key" in the current context. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name, especially when there are multiple nodes in the hierarchy and you want to pinpoint a particular one.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node. In this context, it will get all child nodes of the "crypto.rsa.create-key" node. This is useful for accessing all data or sub-nodes contained within a parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `public` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those with the name "public". It is used here to specifically access the "public" node among the children of "crypto.rsa.create-key", which might contain the public key data in an RSA key pair.
