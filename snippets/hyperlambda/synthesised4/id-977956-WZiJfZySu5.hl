// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes from one source to a destination node. The [add] slot targets the [.logs] node as the destination, and uses [get-nodes] to retrieve all child nodes of [data.read], appending them to [.logs]. This allows dynamic modification of the node structure by transferring nodes from one part of the hierarchy to another.
