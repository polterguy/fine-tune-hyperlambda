/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named ".arguments" from the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the dot before "arguments" specifies that it is looking for a node with this exact name. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the ".arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or slot, allowing further filtering or processing of these nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `foreignTable` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "foreignTable" among the children of ".arguments". It is used to specifically access the "foreignTable" argument, which might be used to specify a foreign table in a database operation or similar context.
