// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [if] slot to check if the value of the [.switch] node is true. If the condition evaluates to true, it executes the [.lambda] block, which logs an informational message indicating that [.switch] is enabled. The [eq] slot is used to compare the value of [.switch] to a boolean true.
