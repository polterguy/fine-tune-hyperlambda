// 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator looks for the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It starts from the current node and checks its siblings and ancestors until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful in scenarios where you need to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot, as it allows you to retrieve the node containing all the arguments for further processing.
