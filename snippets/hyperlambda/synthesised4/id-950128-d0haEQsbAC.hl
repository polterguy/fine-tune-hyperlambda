// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [math.subtract] slot to decrease the value of the [player-score] node by 10. The [get-value] slot retrieves the current value of [player-score], and the subtraction operation is performed with the static integer value 10. The result of this operation will be the new value of [player-score].
