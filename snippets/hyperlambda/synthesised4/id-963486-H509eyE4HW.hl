/*
 * The code checks if the [is_hashed] argument is true, and if so, sets the [password] node's value to the value of the [password] argument. This is achieved using the [if] slot to evaluate the condition and the [set-value] slot to assign the value. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Evaluates a condition to determine if the subsequent lambda should be executed.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [is_hashed] argument to be used as the condition.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 4. [set-value] - Assigns a new value to the [password] node.
 * 5. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [password] argument to assign it to the [password] node.
