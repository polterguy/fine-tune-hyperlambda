// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [yield] slot to return a message from a dynamic slot or function. The [yield] slot is used to return a single value or a node list, and in this case, it returns a message indicating that a role has been assigned, albeit in a simulated context. The [message] node under [yield] holds the string "Role assigned (simulated)".
yield
   message:Role assigned (simulated)
