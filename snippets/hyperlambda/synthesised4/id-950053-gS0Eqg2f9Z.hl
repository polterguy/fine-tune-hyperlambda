// This Hyperlambda code checks if the number of nodes returned by a [data.select] operation equals a specified limit. If true, it appends a notice to the [data.connect] node, indicating that the director might be associated with more companies. The [if] slot evaluates the condition, and the [eq] slot compares the count of nodes to the limit.
