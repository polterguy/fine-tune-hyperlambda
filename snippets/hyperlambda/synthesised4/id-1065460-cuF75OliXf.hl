// 1. `@.sql` - This iterator looks for the first node named "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name, and the `.` signifies that it starts the search from the current node's level in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to directly access a specific node by its name within the current scope, such as retrieving SQL query strings or configurations stored in a node named "sql".
