// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [sqlite.connections.flush] slot, which is used to clear cached schemas and connection pools in a SQLite database environment. This operation is typically performed to ensure that the latest database schema changes are recognized and that any stale connections are removed, allowing for fresh connections to be established with the updated database state. The [sqlite.connections.flush] slot is particularly useful in scenarios where database schema changes occur frequently, and you need to ensure that your application is working with the most current database structure and connections.
