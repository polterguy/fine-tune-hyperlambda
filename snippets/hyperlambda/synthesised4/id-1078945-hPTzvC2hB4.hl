/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves to the next node in the sequence at the same hierarchical level. This is useful when you want to access the node immediately following the current node in the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all direct descendants of the current node, allowing you to work with multiple child nodes simultaneously.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - The second `*` iterator again retrieves all children nodes of the nodes obtained from the previous step. This is useful for accessing the grandchildren of the original node.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - The third `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes obtained from the previous step, effectively accessing the great-grandchildren of the original node.
 * 
 * 5. `content` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "content". It is used to specifically target nodes named "content" among the great-grandchildren of the original node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to navigate a complex Hyperlambda structure where you need to access and manipulate data contained within nodes named "content" that are located three levels down from the elder sibling of the current node. This might be useful in scenarios where you are processing a document or data structure with multiple nested layers and need to extract or modify specific content nodes.
