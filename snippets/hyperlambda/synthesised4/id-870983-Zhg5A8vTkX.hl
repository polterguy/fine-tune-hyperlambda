// This Hyperlambda code adds two nodes, [tokens] and [chat], as children to the node referenced by the expression in [add]. The [tokens] node is assigned an integer value of 200000, and the [chat] node is assigned a boolean value of true. This operation dynamically modifies the graph by appending these nodes to the specified destination node.
