/*
 * 1. `@.exe`: This iterator searches for the first node named "exe" within the current node's hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards, looking for a node with the name "exe". This is useful when you want to retrieve a specific node that may be located at different levels in the hierarchy, such as finding a configuration or execution node in a complex structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Locating an execution command or script node within a configuration file.
 * - Retrieving a node that contains executable instructions or commands in a nested structure.
