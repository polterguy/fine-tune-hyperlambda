/*
 * 1. `@.exe` - This iterator searches for the first node named "exe" starting from the current context. It looks for a node with this exact name and returns it. This is useful when you need to access a specific node within the current context that is known to have a unique name.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator. In this case, it fetches all child nodes of the "exe" node. This is useful when you want to perform operations on or analyze all the children of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `join` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "join" from the previously retrieved children nodes. This is useful when you are interested in nodes with a specific name among the children of a node, allowing you to focus on particular nodes for further processing or evaluation.
