/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks for the "arguments" node among its ancestors or siblings.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It allows you to access each child node under "arguments".
 * 3. `group_column` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "group_column" among the children of the "arguments" node. This effectively selects the "group_column" node under "arguments", if it exists.
 * 
 * This expression is typically used to access a specific argument named "group_column" that is passed to a Hyperlambda function or endpoint. It ensures that the correct node is retrieved from the arguments provided, allowing the function to use its value for further processing.
