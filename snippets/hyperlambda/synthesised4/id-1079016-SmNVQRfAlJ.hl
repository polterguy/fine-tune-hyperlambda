/*
 * 1. `@execute` - This iterator searches for the first node named "execute" in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further traversal in the node hierarchy. A potential use case is when you want to access results from a specific execution block within a larger Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "execute" node. It allows you to access any direct descendants of the "execute" node, which could include various execution details or parameters.
 * 
 * 3. `result` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find the node named "result". It is used to specifically target the result node, which likely contains the outcome of the execution process.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This final iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "result" node. It is used to access detailed information or sub-results contained within the "result" node, which could be useful for further processing or analysis.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include extracting detailed results from a dynamic slot execution or an HTTP endpoint, where the "execute" node represents the execution context and the "result" node holds the outcome data.
