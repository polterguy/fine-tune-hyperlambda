/*
 * 1. `@.hook-url`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "hook-url" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you need to retrieve a specific configuration or URL that might be defined at a higher level in the node hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a webhook URL that is defined as a configuration parameter in a parent node.
 * - Accessing a URL needed for making HTTP requests, which is stored in a centralized location for easy updates.
