/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve the type of a node's value. The [type] slot is used to obtain the type name of the value of the node it references. In this example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to determine the type of this node's value, which is "int". The result of invoking [type] will be the type name of the value, which is "int" in this case.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type name of the value of the referenced node.
