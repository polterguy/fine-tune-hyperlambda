// 1. `@.model-id`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "model-id" that is an ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that the search is for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that the search should start from the current node and move upwards through its ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific configuration or identifier that is defined higher up in the hierarchy, such as retrieving a model identifier in a machine learning pipeline or configuration file.
