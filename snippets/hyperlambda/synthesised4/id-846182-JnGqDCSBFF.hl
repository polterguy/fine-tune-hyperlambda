// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to append a node with a boolean value to a specified node set. The [add] slot targets the children of the [.tmp] node, and adds a new node named [nullable] with a boolean value of true. This operation effectively introduces a new child node under [.tmp], indicating that the node is nullable.
