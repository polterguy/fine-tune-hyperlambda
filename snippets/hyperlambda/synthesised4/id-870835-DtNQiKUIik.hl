// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to import a public RSA key into the system using the [signal] slot. The [content] slot retrieves the public key from a previously created RSA key pair, [enabled] sets the key's status to active, and [username] associates the key with a specific user. This operation is crucial for managing cryptographic keys within an application, ensuring that only authorized users can access or use the keys for cryptographic operations.
