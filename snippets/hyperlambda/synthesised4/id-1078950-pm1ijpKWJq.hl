/*
 * 1. `@.next`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "next" that is at the same level or higher in the hierarchy relative to the current node. It does not traverse siblings but looks for a node named "next" among the current node's ancestors or itself.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve a configuration or setting node named "next" that is defined at a higher level in the hierarchy, which might be used to determine the next step in a process or workflow.
 * - It can also be used in scenarios where a node named "next" holds a value or reference needed for further processing or decision-making in a Hyperlambda script.
