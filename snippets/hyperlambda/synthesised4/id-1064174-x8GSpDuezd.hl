/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is used to locate the arguments node, which typically contains input parameters or configuration for a particular operation or function.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found `.arguments` node. It is used to access the individual argument nodes that are children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `direction` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `direction` among the children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to specifically target the `direction` argument, which might represent a parameter indicating a direction or orientation for a particular operation or function.
