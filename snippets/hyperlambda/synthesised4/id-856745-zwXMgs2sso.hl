// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [type] slot to determine the type of a node's value. The [.foo] node is declared with an integer type and a value of 57. The [type] slot is then used with an expression to retrieve the type of the node's value, which will return "int". This is useful for dynamically checking and handling data types within Hyperlambda scripts.
