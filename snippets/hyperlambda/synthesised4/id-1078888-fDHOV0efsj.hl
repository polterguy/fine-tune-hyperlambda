// 1. `@.found`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "found" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node's siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific node named "found" that might be located at various levels within the node structure. A potential use case could be checking if a particular node named "found" exists in the current execution context, which might indicate a successful search or operation in a larger workflow.
