// The Hyperlambda code reads data from the "ml_blocked_ips" table, applying a filter where the "ip_address" column must equal the value obtained from the HTTP request headers. The [data.read] slot is used to construct a SQL query with a [where] clause, utilizing the [and] and [eq] slots to define the condition based on the request's IP address.
