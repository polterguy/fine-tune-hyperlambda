// The provided Hyperlambda code uses the [remove-nodes] slot to delete specific nodes from a node graph. It targets nodes within a nested structure, specifically under [data.connect], [data.delete], [where], [and], and [or], and removes them. This operation is useful for dynamically modifying a node graph by eliminating unwanted nodes based on their hierarchical position.
