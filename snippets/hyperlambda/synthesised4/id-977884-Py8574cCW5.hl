// The [context] slot in Hyperlambda allows you to store an object with a specified name onto a stack, making it accessible throughout the execution of a Hyperlambda snippet. This stored context can be retrieved later using the [get-context] slot, enabling the sharing of data across different parts of the code without passing it directly as arguments. This feature is particularly useful for maintaining data accessibility across various slots and invoked Hyperlambda files during execution.
