// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "sql" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards, including siblings and their children, until it finds a node named "sql". This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is known to exist somewhere above the current node in the structure, particularly when dealing with SQL queries or commands stored in a node named "sql".
