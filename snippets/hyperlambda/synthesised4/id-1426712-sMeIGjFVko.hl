// The Hyperlambda code concatenates a static string "Formatting re-enabled\n\n" with the content of a specific node in a session object. It uses the [strings.concat] slot to combine these strings, where the content is retrieved from a node path that filters for a "developer" role within a session, and accesses the content of the first matching node.
strings.concat:x:@.session/**/role/=developer/[0,1]/./*/content
   .:"Formatting re-enabled\n\n"
   get-value:x:@.session/**/role/=developer/[0,1]/./*/content
