 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate up one level in the node hierarchy.
 * 2. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access every child node without filtering by name.
 * 3. `signal` - This filters the previously retrieved node set to only include nodes with the name "signal". It is used to specifically target nodes named "signal".
 * 4. `=` - This filters nodes based on their value. In this case, it retrieves nodes with the value "magic.ai.crawl-site". It is used to find nodes with a specific value.
 * 5. `*` - Again, this retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access every child node without filtering by name.
 * 6. `.onafter` - This retrieves the parent node of the current node and filters it to include only nodes named ".onafter". It is used to navigate to a specific sibling node.
 * 7. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access every child node without filtering by name.
 * 8. `.vectorize` - This filters the previously retrieved node set to only include nodes with the name ".vectorize". It is used to specifically target nodes named ".vectorize".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a scenario where you need to traverse a node structure to find and process nodes related to a specific AI crawling operation, specifically targeting nodes involved in vectorization processes after a signal event. 
 * - It could be useful in a system that processes AI tasks, where you need to ensure certain operations are performed on nodes that have been marked for vectorization after a crawling signal has been triggered.
