// Evaluates a logical condition using [or] to determine if either a [not] condition or a [get-value] condition is true. The [not] condition checks if the [exists] slot returns false for the presence of a [semantics] node within [.arguments]. If the [semantics] node does not exist, or if it exists and its value is truthy, the overall condition evaluates to true.
