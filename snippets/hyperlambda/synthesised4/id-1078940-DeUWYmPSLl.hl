/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "dp" that is located before the current node in its hierarchy. This is often used to access a specific node that is known to exist in the current context, typically used in loops or iterations where "dp" represents the data point or current item being processed.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the "dp" node is another node, and it retrieves this node by reference. This is useful when you want to manipulate or access the actual node rather than a copy of its value.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing for operations on multiple child nodes.
 * 
 * 4. `"{@.arguments/*/completion}"` - This part is a dynamic expression that evaluates to a string value. The expression inside the curly braces `{}` is evaluated first. It uses the `@` iterator to find the first node named "completion" within the children of the "arguments" node. The result of this evaluation is then used as a literal string to match against the names of the children nodes obtained by the `*` iterator. This allows for dynamic filtering of nodes based on the value of another node in the context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in scenarios where you need to dynamically select and process nodes based on a value provided at runtime, such as in a templating system or a dynamic configuration setup.
 * - It could be used in a data processing pipeline where the specific nodes to be processed are determined by a parameter or input value, allowing for flexible and adaptable workflows.
