// Retrieves all [name] nodes that are children of the node referenced by the value of the first [.dp] node it finds upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful for accessing specific fields or properties within a data structure that is passed by reference, allowing for dynamic data manipulation or retrieval based on the current context. Potential use cases include iterating over a collection of objects to extract specific attributes or fields, such as retrieving all user names from a list of user objects.
