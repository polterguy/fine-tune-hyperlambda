// 1. `@.fields`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "fields" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards, including the current node itself and its siblings. This is useful when you need to access a specific node named "fields" that is located somewhere above or at the same level as the current node in the Hyperlambda structure.
