// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a database read operation using the [data.read] slot. This operation is configured to interact with an SQLite database and specifically targets a table named "campaigns". The [columns] node specifies the selection of an aggregate function result, which is aliased as "result". The [where] node includes an [and] condition, although no specific conditions are detailed in this snippet. The [group] node indicates that the results will be grouped by a column named "group_column". Finally, the [return-nodes] slot is used to return all nodes resulting from the [data.read] operation. This setup is useful for executing complex SQL queries that involve aggregation and grouping, and then retrieving the results programmatically.
