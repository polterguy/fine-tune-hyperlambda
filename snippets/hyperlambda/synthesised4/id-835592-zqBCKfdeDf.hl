// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of a node by concatenating a string and a value. The [set-name] slot targets a specific node using its expression, and the [strings.concat] slot combines a static string with the value retrieved by [get-value]. The result of [strings.concat] becomes the new name for the targeted node.
