// 1. `@.fields`: This iterator looks for the first node named "fields" within the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards through its ancestors and siblings to find the first occurrence of a node with the name "fields". This is useful when you want to access or manipulate data specifically associated with a "fields" node in your Hyperlambda structure, such as retrieving configuration settings or field definitions related to a particular operation or data structure.
