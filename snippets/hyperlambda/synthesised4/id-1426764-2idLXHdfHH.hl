// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [switch] slot to perform conditional branching based on the value of a node. The [switch] slot evaluates the value of the [.val] node and executes the first matching [case] node. If no [case] node matches, the [default] node is executed. In the first example, the value of [.val] is "foo", so the [case:foo] node is executed, setting the [.result] node's value to "Success!". In the second example, the value of [.val] is "fooXX", which doesn't match any [case] node, so the [default] node is executed, setting the [.result] node's value to "Success!". The [default] node is optional and is used when no [case] nodes match. Each [case] node must have a value, while the [default] node cannot have a value. The [switch] node must have at least one [case] node, and different types can be used as values for the [case] nodes.
