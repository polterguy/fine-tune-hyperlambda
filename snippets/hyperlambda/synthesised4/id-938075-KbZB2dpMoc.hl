// The code demonstrates the use of the [fork] slot to execute a lambda object in a separate thread. It includes a [sleep] slot to pause execution for 300 milliseconds, followed by a [log.info] slot to log a message indicating the completion of the sleep period. This allows the main thread to continue executing without waiting for the forked task to complete.
