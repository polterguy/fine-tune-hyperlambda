// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node it's referenced in is reached, allowing for forward evaluation. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate the expression pointing to the next node, ensuring that its value is resolved before the [.dest] node is processed, effectively setting [.dest]'s value to the evaluated result.
