/*
 * 1. `@crypto.sign`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "crypto.sign" in the current context. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might not be a direct child or sibling of the current node but exists somewhere in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to access a node responsible for cryptographic signing operations, allowing you to retrieve or manipulate its children or value for tasks such as verifying digital signatures or signing data.
