/*
 * 1. `@.page-header`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "page-header" from the current context. It is used to locate a specific node within the current hierarchy. A potential use case is to find a section of a document or webpage that is labeled as "page-header".
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "page-header" node. It is used to access all elements that are directly under the "page-header" node. A potential use case is to gather all elements contained within the page header, such as titles, subtitles, or metadata.
 * 
 * 3. `h4`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "h4". It is used to specifically target elements that are headers of level 4 within the page header. A potential use case is to extract subheadings or specific header information from a webpage or document's header section.
