// The code snippet demonstrates a usage of the [case] slot in Hyperlambda to handle a specific integer value, in this case, 500. When this value is encountered, it triggers the [throw] slot to raise an exception with the message "500 Internal Server Error – Please try again later". This setup is typically used for error handling, allowing the system to respond to specific conditions with appropriate error messages.
case:int:500
   throw:500 Internal Server Error – Please try again later
