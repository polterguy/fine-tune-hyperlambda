/*
 * The expression `.:x:@.no` is a simple Hyperlambda expression that uses a single iterator. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@.no`: This is the iterator part of the expression. The `@` symbol is used to find the first node with the specified name, which in this case is `no`. The `.` before `no` indicates that the search starts from the current node's context, looking for a sibling or a child node named `no`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression:
 * - Retrieve the value of a node named `no` that is a sibling or a direct child of the current node. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to check or manipulate the value of a node that is conditionally present in the current scope.
