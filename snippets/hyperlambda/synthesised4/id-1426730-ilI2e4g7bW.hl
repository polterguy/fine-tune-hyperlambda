// This code snippet demonstrates the use of a [case] node within a [switch] statement in Hyperlambda. The [case:Allow] node is used to define a specific condition or value that, when matched by the [switch] expression, will trigger the execution of the associated block of code. This mechanism is similar to switch/case constructs in traditional programming languages, allowing for conditional execution based on matching values.
