// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes into a destination node specified by the expression in its primary argument. It retrieves nodes using the [get-nodes] slot, which points to all descendant nodes of the "article" element within the "body" of the HTML structure converted to a lambda object by [html2lambda]. The retrieved nodes are then added to the children of the [.content] node.
add:x:@.content
