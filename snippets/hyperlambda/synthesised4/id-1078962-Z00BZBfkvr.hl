/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you need to access or manipulate the parent node's properties or its siblings.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is often used to iterate over or access all children nodes of a particular node.
 * 3. `return` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "return". It is used when you want to specifically target nodes with this name.
 * 4. `*` - Similar to the previous `*`, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "return" nodes. It allows you to access or manipulate the children of these nodes.
 * 5. `meta` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "meta". It is used to specifically target nodes with this name, typically to access metadata or related information.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to navigate through a structured data set where you need to access metadata associated with a return value or result. For instance, in a logging or auditing system, you might want to extract metadata about the return values of certain operations for further analysis or reporting.
