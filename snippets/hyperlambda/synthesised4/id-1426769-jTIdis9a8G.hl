/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes into a destination node's children collection. The code adds nodes from a source node set to multiple destination nodes. Specifically, it takes all nodes from the [.tmp] node and appends them to each [return-nodes] child node of the [pgsql.connect] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - This slot is used to append nodes into the destination node's children collection.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves the nodes from the [.tmp] node to be added to the destination nodes.
 * 3. [../*/pgsql.connect/*/return-nodes] - The expression specifies the destination nodes, which are all [return-nodes] nodes that are children of any [pgsql.connect] node.
