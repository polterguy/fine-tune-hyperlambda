/*
 * 1. `@data.connect` - This iterator searches for the first node named "data.connect" in the current context. It starts from the current node and traverses upwards and sideways through siblings and ancestors to find the first occurrence of a node with this name. This is useful for locating a specific node in a complex hierarchy where the node's position is not fixed.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "data.connect" node, allowing you to work with or evaluate each child node individually.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes named "data.read" among the children of "data.connect". It is used to narrow down the node set to specific nodes of interest, in this case, nodes that are specifically named "data.read". This is useful when you need to perform operations or evaluations on nodes with a specific name within a larger set of nodes.
