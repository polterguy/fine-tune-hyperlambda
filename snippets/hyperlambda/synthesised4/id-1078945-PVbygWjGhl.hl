/*
 * 1. `@.channel`: This iterator searches for the first node named "channel" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "channel" node it encounters in the ancestor chain. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve configuration or context information stored in a "channel" node that is shared across multiple parts of a Hyperlambda graph.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to access a communication or data channel configuration that is defined at a higher level in the hierarchy, ensuring that you are using the correct context for operations like sending messages or data processing.
