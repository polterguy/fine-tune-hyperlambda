/*
 * 1. `@.below-threshold`: This iterator searches for the first node named "below-threshold" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its hierarchy. It will return the first match it finds. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located at a higher level in the hierarchy, such as when checking a condition or threshold value that affects multiple parts of the Hyperlambda structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a threshold value to compare against other values in a decision-making process.
 * - Accessing configuration settings or flags that are defined at a higher level in the hierarchy.
