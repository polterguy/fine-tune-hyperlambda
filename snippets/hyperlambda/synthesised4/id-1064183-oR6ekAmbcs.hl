/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda, especially in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is useful for iterating over or accessing all argument nodes provided to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `aggregate_column` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `aggregate_column` among the children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access a specific argument named `aggregate_column`, which might be used for operations like aggregating data in a collection.
