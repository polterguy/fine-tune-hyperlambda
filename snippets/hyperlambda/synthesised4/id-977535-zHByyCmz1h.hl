// This Hyperlambda code uses the [format] slot to format a number according to a specified pattern. The expression [x:-] indicates that the value to be formatted is located in the previous node. The [pattern] node specifies the format pattern "{0:N0}", which formats the number with thousands separators and no decimal places, using the invariant culture unless overridden by a [culture] argument.
format:x:-
   pattern:"{0:N0}"
