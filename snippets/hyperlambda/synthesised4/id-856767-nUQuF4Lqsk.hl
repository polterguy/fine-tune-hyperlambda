// The code snippet checks multiple conditions using the [and] slot to ensure all are true. It verifies if a node exists at a specific path with [exists], checks if a child node has a non-null value with [not-null], and compares the integer value of a node to see if it's greater than zero using [mt] after converting it with [convert].
