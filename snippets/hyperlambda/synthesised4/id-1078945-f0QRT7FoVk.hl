/*
 * 1. `@.cache-session`: This iterator searches for the first node named "cache-session" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first matching node it encounters. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located at different levels in the hierarchy, such as retrieving session data stored in a node named "cache-session".
 * 
 * 2. `0`: This iterator retrieves the first child of the node returned by the previous iterator. This is useful when you want to access the first element in a list or collection of nodes under the "cache-session" node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve the first item or value stored in a session cache, which might be useful in scenarios where you need to access session-specific data, such as user preferences or temporary data storage, during a web request or application session.
