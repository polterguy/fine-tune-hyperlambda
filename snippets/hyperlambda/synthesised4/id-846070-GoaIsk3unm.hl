// This code snippet constructs a URL by concatenating a base URL with a specific segment extracted from a data path. The [set-value] slot assigns the result to the [.url] node. The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate the base URL retrieved by [get-value] from [.base] with a segment extracted using a complex expression. The expression in [get-value] navigates through a data structure to find and concatenate the required segment, which is then combined with the base URL.
set-value:x:@.url
   strings.concat
      get-value:x:@.base
      get-value:x:"@.dp/#/*/\\@src/[0,1]"
