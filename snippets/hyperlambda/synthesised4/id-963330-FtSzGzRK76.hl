// The code demonstrates how to use the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a target substring within a string node with a replacement string. It retrieves the target and replacement strings using [get-value] from specified nodes and applies the replacement to the string located at [.phrase]. The result is a modified string where all instances of the target substring are replaced by the replacement string.
strings.replace:x:@.phrase
   get-value:x:@.target
   get-value:x:@.replacement
