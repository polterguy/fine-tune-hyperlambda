// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate the expression pointing to the next sibling node, ensuring that the [.dest] node is assigned the value of [.src] before it is reached. This is useful when invoking lambda objects with expressions, as it allows for pre-evaluation of expressions within the lambda object.
