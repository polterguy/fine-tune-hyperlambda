// This Hyperlambda snippet changes the name of nodes within a specific path in a data structure. It targets nodes under [data.connect], specifically within [data.read] and [group], and renames them based on the value of [group_column] provided in [.arguments]. The [set-name] slot is used for renaming, and [get-value] retrieves the new name from the arguments.
set-name:x:@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/group_column
