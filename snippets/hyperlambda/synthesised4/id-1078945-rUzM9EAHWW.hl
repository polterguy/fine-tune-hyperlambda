 * 1. `@.session` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" that is found before or at the current node in the hierarchy. It is useful for accessing session-related data or configurations stored in a node named "session".
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "session" node. It is useful for accessing all the data or configurations stored within the session node, such as user information, session tokens, or other session-specific data.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to access and manipulate session-related data in a web application, such as retrieving user information or session tokens for authentication or session management purposes.
