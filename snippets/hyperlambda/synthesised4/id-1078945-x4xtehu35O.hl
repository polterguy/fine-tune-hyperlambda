/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` within the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a slot or function.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access the individual argument nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `max_context_tokens`: This iterator filters the children nodes to find the one specifically named `max_context_tokens`. It is used to access the value of the `max_context_tokens` argument.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * 
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to retrieve the value of a `max_context_tokens` argument, which might be used to limit or configure the maximum number of tokens in a context, such as in a language model or text processing application.
 * - It could be used in a validation step to ensure that the `max_context_tokens` argument is provided and to retrieve its value for further processing or decision-making.
