/*
 * 1. `@.sql` - This iterator looks for the first node named "sql" at the current level of the hierarchy or any ancestor level. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy until it finds a node with the name "sql". This is useful when you need to access a SQL-related node that might be defined at a higher level in your Hyperlambda structure, such as a database query or command node that is reused across different parts of the code. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a SQL query or command node that is defined at a higher level in a configuration or setup section of the Hyperlambda code.
 * - Reusing a common SQL node across multiple operations or functions within the same Hyperlambda file.
