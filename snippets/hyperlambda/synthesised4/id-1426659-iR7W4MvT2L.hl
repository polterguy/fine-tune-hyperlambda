// The [unwrap] slot in this Hyperlambda code is used to evaluate an expression before the node where it's referenced is reached. The expression "x:+/*/*/*" is dynamically evaluated, allowing the code to forward evaluate expressions inside the lambda object before it is actually executed. This is useful for preparing or transforming data in advance of its use.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*
