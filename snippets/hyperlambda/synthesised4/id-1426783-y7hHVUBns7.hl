 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the [result] node is not null and its value is not equal to an empty string. If both conditions are true, the [and] slot evaluates to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Combines multiple conditions and evaluates to true only if all conditions are true.
 * 2. [not-null] - Checks if the [result] node is not null.
 * 3. [neq] - Checks if the value of the [result] node is not equal to an empty string.
