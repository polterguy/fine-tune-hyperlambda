// This Hyperlambda code snippet concatenates strings to form a SQL query. It uses [set-value] to change the value of the [.sql] node by invoking [strings.concat], which combines the current value of [.sql] with additional strings to construct a SQL statement that selects from the "Regions" table where "keyword_count" is greater than 0. The slots involved are: [set-value] for modifying node values, [strings.concat] for string concatenation, and [get-value] for retrieving the current value of [.sql].
