// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each child node of [.data] using [for-each], and for each iteration, it replaces occurrences of a string in [.result] with another string. The [set-value] slot updates the value of [.result] by calling [strings.replace], which replaces the string found in the [.what] node with the string in the [.with] node, both retrieved from the current node being iterated.
