 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches upwards in the hierarchy to find the node named "arguments".
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "arguments" node. It allows access to any direct children under the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `strength` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "strength" among the children of the "arguments" node. It selects nodes specifically named "strength" from the children nodes.
