/*
 * 1. `@.cont`: This iterator searches for the first node named "cont" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, looking at siblings and their children if necessary. This iterator is useful when you need to reference a specific node that has already been defined earlier in the structure, ensuring that you are working with the correct context or data segment. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or context information that is defined at the beginning of a Hyperlambda script.
 * - Retrieving a value or node that is used as a common reference point for subsequent operations or logic in the script.
