// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.channel] node to the first element obtained from splitting a string. The [set-value] slot changes the value of the [.channel] node, while the [get-value] slot retrieves the first element from the result of the [strings.split] operation. The [strings.split] slot is used to divide a string into parts, and the [0] index retrieves the first part of this split result.
