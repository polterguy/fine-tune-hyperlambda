// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.value] node by joining the values of all child nodes under [.ids] using a comma as a separator. The [set-value] slot is used to assign the concatenated string result from [strings.join] to [.value]. The [strings.join] slot takes each child node of [.ids] and combines them into a single string, separated by commas.
