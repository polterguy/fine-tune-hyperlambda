// 1. `@.lambda`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "lambda" that is before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches for a sibling node or a node higher up in the hierarchy with the specified name. This is useful when you want to reference a specific node that might be a sibling or an ancestor in the current execution context, allowing you to access or manipulate its value or children.
