/*
 * 1. `@.outgoing`: This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which means it will search for the first node with the name "outgoing" in the current context. The `@` iterator looks for a node by name starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy until it finds a match. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to retrieve or manipulate data related to "outgoing" messages or transactions in a system, assuming "outgoing" is a node that contains such information.
 * - It might be used in a logging or monitoring system to access and log outgoing requests or responses.
