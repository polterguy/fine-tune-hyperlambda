// This Hyperlambda code connects to the "auth" database and inserts a new record into the "users" table. It uses the [data.create] slot to specify the table and the [values] slot to define the fields and their values, which are dynamically retrieved from the [.arguments] node, specifically the "name" and "email" fields. This approach ensures that the values are securely passed as parameters, preventing SQL injection attacks.
