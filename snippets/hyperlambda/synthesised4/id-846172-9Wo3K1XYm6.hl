// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.connection] node by concatenating a static string "[generic|" with the value of the [database] node found within [.arguments], and appending a closing bracket "]". The [set-value] slot is used to assign this concatenated string to [.connection], while [strings.concat] combines the components into a single string.
