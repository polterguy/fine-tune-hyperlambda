// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node by loading a file's content and then replacing occurrences of the string "foo" with "bar" using [strings.replace]. The [set-value] slot targets the node referenced by [@io.file.load], and the [strings.replace] slot processes the file content to perform the string substitution.
set-value:x:@io.file.load
   strings.replace:x:@io.file.load
      .:foo
      .:bar
