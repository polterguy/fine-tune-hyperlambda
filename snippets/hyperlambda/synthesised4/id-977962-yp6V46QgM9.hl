// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a SQL table named "experiments" using the [data.read] slot. The [data.read] slot is used to execute a SQL SELECT statement, and the [table] argument specifies the name of the table to read from. By default, this will select all columns and limit the result set to 25 records unless otherwise specified.
data.read
   table:experiments
