// The code connects to a SQLite database and deletes records from the "address" table based on conditions dynamically added from the arguments. It uses [data.connect] to establish the connection, [add] to append conditions to the [where] clause, [data.delete] to perform the deletion, and [unwrap] to evaluate expressions. Finally, it returns the number of affected rows using [return].
