// This Hyperlambda code changes the names of nodes referenced by the expression [x:+/+/*/*] to a concatenated string. The new name is formed by concatenating the value of the node referenced by [@p] and the value of the node referenced by [@.no]. The [set-name] slot is used for renaming nodes, while [strings.concat] combines multiple string values into one.
