// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, it evaluates the expression [x:+/*/*] and replaces the node's value with the result of this evaluation. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions inside a lambda object before it is executed.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
