/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. In the context of a Hyperlambda expression, it moves to the next node below the current node in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the node that is directly below the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `+` - This second `+` iterator again retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. After moving to the next node with the first `+`, this iterator moves to the node directly below that one. This allows for sequential access to nodes that are siblings in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to navigate through a sequence of sibling nodes, accessing each one in turn. It might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or evaluate nodes in a linear sequence, such as iterating through a list of operations or data points that are organized as siblings in the Hyperlambda structure.
