// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [prefix] exists within [.arguments], is not null, and is not equal to an empty string. It uses [exists] to verify the presence of the node, [not-null] to ensure it has a value, and [neq] to confirm the value is not an empty string. If all conditions are true, the [and] slot evaluates to true.
