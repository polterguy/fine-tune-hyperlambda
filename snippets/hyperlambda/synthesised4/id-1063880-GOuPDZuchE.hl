// 1. `@http.get`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "http.get" in the current context. It is useful when you want to access or manipulate the first occurrence of a node with a specific name, in this case, "http.get". This is typically used to access HTTP GET request parameters or configurations in a Hyperlambda script.
