// The [throw] slot in Hyperlambda is used to raise exceptions with a specified message. By adding a [public] parameter set to "true", the exception can be propagated to the client, even in release builds, if no [.catch] block handles it. You can also specify a [status] code and a [field] to provide additional context about the error.
