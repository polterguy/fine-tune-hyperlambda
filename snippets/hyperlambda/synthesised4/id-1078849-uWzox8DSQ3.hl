/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is used to locate the `.arguments` node, which typically contains the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access all argument nodes that are direct children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `offset` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `offset`. It is used to locate a specific argument named `offset` among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a function or an endpoint to retrieve the value of an `offset` argument, which might be used for pagination or to determine a starting point in a list of items.
