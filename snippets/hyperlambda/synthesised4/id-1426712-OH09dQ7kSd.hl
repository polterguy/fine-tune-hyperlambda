/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to set a node's value to a concatenated string of node names, converted to a specific type. The code uses the [set-x] slot to change the value of nodes referenced by its expression, which is a concatenation of node names obtained through [strings.concat]. The resulting concatenated string is then converted to a specified type using the [convert] slot. The code effectively combines node names into a single string and converts it to a desired type, setting it as the value of the target node.
 * 
 * 1. [set-x] - Sets the value of nodes referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [convert] - Converts the concatenated string to a specified type.
 * 3. [strings.concat] - Concatenates node names into a single string.
