// The Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and resolve an expression that navigates through a node structure. The expression `x:+/*/*/*` is used to traverse the node hierarchy, starting from the next sibling node, and then navigating through multiple levels of child nodes. The [unwrap] slot ensures that the expression is evaluated before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing for dynamic resolution of node paths and values in the Hyperlambda graph.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*
