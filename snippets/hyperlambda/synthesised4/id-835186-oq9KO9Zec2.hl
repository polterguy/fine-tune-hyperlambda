// The code snippet uses the [strings.join] slot to concatenate text nodes found at a specific path within a node structure. It navigates through the nodes using a complex lambda expression and joins the text nodes with no separator, as indicated by the empty string argument. The path includes various iterators to traverse the node hierarchy and filter nodes by name and value.
