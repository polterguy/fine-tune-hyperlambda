/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator looks for the first node named `.dp` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. The `.dp` node is typically used in [for-each] loops to represent the currently iterated node. This iterator is useful for accessing the current node being processed in a loop or iteration context.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator, treating it as a node reference. It allows you to access or modify the original node's value directly, rather than working with a copy. This is particularly useful when you want to change the value of the node being iterated over in a [for-each] loop.
