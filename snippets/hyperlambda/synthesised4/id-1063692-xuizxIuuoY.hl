/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to locate the [.arguments] node, which typically contains input parameters or arguments for a function or process.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument or parameter that is passed to the function or process.
 * 
 * 3. `seed`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "seed" among the children of the [.arguments] node. It is used to specifically access the "seed" parameter, which might be used for operations like random number generation or as a unique identifier in a process.
