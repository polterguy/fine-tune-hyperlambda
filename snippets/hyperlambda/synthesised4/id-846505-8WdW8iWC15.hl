// The [and] slot in Hyperlambda is used for logical conjunction, requiring all of its child conditions to evaluate to true for the entire [and] block to be true. It short-circuits evaluation, meaning if any condition is false, it stops evaluating further conditions. This slot is useful for constructing complex logical expressions where multiple conditions must be met simultaneously.
