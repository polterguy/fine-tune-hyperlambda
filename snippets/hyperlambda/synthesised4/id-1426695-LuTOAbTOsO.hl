// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [convert] slot to change the type of a node's value. The [convert] slot is used to transform the value of a node from its original type to a specified type. In this example, the value of the [.foo] node, initially a string "57", is converted to an integer using the [convert] slot with a [type] argument set to "int". This operation is useful for ensuring that a node's value is in the desired format for further processing or calculations.
