// The code constructs a URL by concatenating a base URL with a specific part of a URL path extracted from a node. It uses [set-value] to assign the concatenated result to [.url], [strings.concat] to combine the base URL and the extracted path, and [get-value] to retrieve values from the specified nodes.
set-value:x:@.url
   strings.concat
      get-value:x:@.base
      get-value:x:"@.dp/#/./*/\\@href/[0,1]"
