// This Hyperlambda code checks if a specific file, "plan-purchased.html", does not exist in the "/etc/wl/" directory. The [not] slot is used to logically invert the result of the [io.file.exists] slot, which returns true if the file exists. Therefore, the overall expression evaluates to true if the file is absent.
not
