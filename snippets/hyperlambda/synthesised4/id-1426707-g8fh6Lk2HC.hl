 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet adds nodes to a specific location in a node graph. It uses the [add] slot to insert nodes after the "snippets" node found in the current context. The nodes to be added are retrieved using the [get-nodes] slot, which points to all children of the [.file-data] node. This is useful for dynamically expanding a node structure by appending additional nodes from a specified source.
 * // 1. [add] - Inserts nodes at a specified location in the node graph, after the "snippets" node.
 * // 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves all children nodes of the [.file-data] node to be added.
