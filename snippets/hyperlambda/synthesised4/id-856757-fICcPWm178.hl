// This Hyperlambda code constructs a URI by concatenating various components such as the request scheme, host, and a specific path, and appends a URL-encoded filename to it. The [set-value] slot assigns the resulting URI to the [.uri] node. The [strings.concat] slot is used to build the URI string, while [strings.url-encode] ensures the filename is safely encoded for URL usage. The [request.scheme] and [request.host] slots retrieve the current request's scheme and host respectively, forming the base of the URI.
