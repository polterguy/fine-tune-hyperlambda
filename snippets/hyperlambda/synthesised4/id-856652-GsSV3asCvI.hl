// This Hyperlambda code uses the [neq] slot to check if the type of a node, accessed through a lambda expression, is not equal to "internal". The [neq] slot evaluates the expression pointing to the node's type and compares it to the static string "internal". If the values are not the same, the [neq] condition returns true.
