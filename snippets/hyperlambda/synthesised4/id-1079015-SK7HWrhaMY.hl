/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for the first node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is often used to access a specific node that holds data or a reference point within the current execution context.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is a node itself, allowing access to this node by reference. This is useful when the value of a node is another node, and you want to manipulate or access the referenced node directly.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, which is useful when you need to iterate over or examine all child nodes of a particular node.
 * 
 * 4. `src` - This iterator filters the result set obtained from the previous iterator to include only nodes with the name "src". It is used to narrow down the node set to those specifically named "src", which is helpful when you are interested in nodes with this specific name among potentially many children.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a scenario where you have a data processing pipeline, and you need to access the "src" nodes within a dynamically referenced node structure. For example, in a data transformation task, you might use this expression to retrieve source data nodes that need to be processed or transformed.
 * - Another use case could be in a configuration management system where ".dp" holds configuration settings, and you need to access specific "src" nodes to apply or modify settings based on the source information they contain.
