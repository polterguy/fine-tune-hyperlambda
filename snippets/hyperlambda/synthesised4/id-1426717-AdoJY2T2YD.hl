// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. It executes a [set-value] operation to assign the value retrieved from a [get-value] operation on the [.context] node to the [.tmp] node. This action occurs only if preceding conditional slots, such as [if] or [else-if], evaluate to false, making [else] the default execution path. The [else] slot does not require a condition, and its actions are executed directly as its children nodes.
