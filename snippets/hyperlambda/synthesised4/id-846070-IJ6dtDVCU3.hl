// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot, which executes its child nodes if none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are true. Here, it uses [set-value] to change the value of the [url] node to the result of a [get-value] expression. The [get-value] expression retrieves a value from a specific node path, using a lambda expression to navigate the node structure.
