/*
 * 1. `@.session` - This iterator searches for the first node named "session" within the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful for accessing session-related data that might be stored in a node named "session".
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "session" node. It allows you to access all the data stored within the session node, which could include user-specific information, session variables, or other relevant data.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving all session variables or data for a user in a web application to manage user-specific settings or preferences.
 * - Accessing session-related information for logging or auditing purposes in an application.
