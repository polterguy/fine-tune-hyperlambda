// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specific string within another string. It takes a placeholder string [[button]] and replaces it with the first value obtained from the [get-value] slot, which retrieves the value of a node named [button] within the [.arguments] node. The [get-first-value] slot ensures that only the first value found is used for the replacement.
