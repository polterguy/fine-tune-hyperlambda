/*
 * The code uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a SignalR signal to all connections associated with the current session. It includes an [args] node with three arguments: [function_result], [invocation], and [file]. These arguments are dynamically populated using expressions that retrieve values from [config.get] and [execute] nodes, which are then transmitted as JSON to the subscribers. This allows for real-time communication with clients connected to the session, providing them with updated data or instructions based on the executed workflow and configuration settings. 
 * 
 * 1. [sockets.signal] - Sends a SignalR signal to all connections associated with the current session.
 * 2. [args] - Contains the arguments to be transmitted to the subscribers as JSON.
 * 3. [function_result] - Retrieves a value from [config.get] to be included in the signal.
 * 4. [invocation] - Retrieves a value from the [execute] node's [json] child to be included in the signal.
 * 5. [file] - Retrieves a value from the [execute] node's [workflow] child to be included in the signal.
