// 1. `@.private-key`: This iterator searches for the first node named "private-key" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and the `.` before "private-key" specifies that it is looking for this node in the current context or scope. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate the value of a specific node within the current execution context, such as accessing a private key stored in a node for cryptographic operations.
