// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" at the current level of the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings but only checks the current node and its children. This is useful when you want to directly access a specific node named "sql" that is expected to be at the current level in the node structure.
