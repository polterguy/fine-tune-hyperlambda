/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. It is used to access the [.arguments] node, which typically contains the arguments passed to a function or a slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument node individually within the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `aggregate_function` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [aggregate_function] from the previous result set. It is used to specifically target and retrieve the [aggregate_function] node among the children of the [.arguments] node.
