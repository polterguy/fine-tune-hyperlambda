// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [not] slot to negate the result of an [eq] comparison. The [eq] slot checks if the value retrieved from [.arguments/*/hyperlambda] is equal to the value of the child node [.]. If the values are equal, [eq] returns true, but the [not] slot negates this result, effectively returning false if the values are equal and true if they are not. This structure is useful for conditional logic where the opposite of a comparison result is needed.
