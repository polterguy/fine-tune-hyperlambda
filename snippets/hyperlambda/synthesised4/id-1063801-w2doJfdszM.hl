/*
 * 1. `@.reference` - This iterator searches for the first node named "reference" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node and its siblings.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "reference" node found by the previous iterator. It allows access to the entire set of child nodes under "reference".
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to return only the nodes named "session". It effectively narrows down the children of "reference" to those specifically named "session".
 * 
 * This expression is useful for navigating a hierarchical data structure to find a specific node named "session" that is a child of a node named "reference". It can be used in scenarios where you need to extract or manipulate data related to a "session" within a "reference" context.
