// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to add a new node to the current node's children. The new node has a name of [signal] and contains a child node named [referrer]. The value of the [referrer] node is set by referencing another node in the hierarchy using the expression [@.referrer]. This allows for dynamic referencing and modification of the node structure based on the current context.
