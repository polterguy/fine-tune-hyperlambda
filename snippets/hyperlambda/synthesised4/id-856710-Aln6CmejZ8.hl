// The code snippet demonstrates how to change the name of nodes using the [set-name] slot. It targets nodes based on a relative expression and assigns them a new name derived from a value obtained through a [get-value] operation. The [set-name] slot is used to rename nodes, while the [get-value] slot fetches a specific value from a node, which is then used as the new name for the targeted nodes.
