/*
 * 1. `@cache.get`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "cache.get" in the current context. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings, until it finds a match. This is useful when you want to access a specific node that may not be a direct child of the current node but exists somewhere in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a cached value that is stored in a node named "cache.get" to avoid recalculating or fetching data.
 * - Retrieving configuration or state information that is stored in a node with this specific name.
