// The [validators.enum] slot ensures that the value of the [aggregate_function] node is one of the predefined legal values: "min", "max", "sum", "avg", or "count". If the value does not match any of these options, an exception is thrown. This is useful for validating input against a set of allowed aggregate functions.
