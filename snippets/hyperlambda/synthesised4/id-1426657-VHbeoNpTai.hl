/*
 * This Hyperlambda code concatenates parts of a URL. It retrieves the first part of a split string, adds "://" to it, and then appends another part of the split string. The result is set as the value of the [.base] node.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.base] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings together.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@strings.split/@strings.split/0] - Retrieves the first part of a previously split string.
 * 4. [.:"://"] - Static string to be concatenated, representing the protocol separator in a URL.
 * 5. [get-value:x:@strings.split/0] - Retrieves another part of the split string.
