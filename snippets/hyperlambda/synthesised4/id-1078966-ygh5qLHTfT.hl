/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an HTTP endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. This is useful for accessing any arguments that are passed as children nodes under the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `feedback-channel` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `feedback-channel`. This is useful for accessing a specific argument or parameter named `feedback-channel` that might be passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to retrieve the value of a specific argument named `feedback-channel` that is passed to it. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to process or respond to feedback provided through a specific channel, such as logging feedback, sending it to a different service, or using it to modify the behavior of the application.
