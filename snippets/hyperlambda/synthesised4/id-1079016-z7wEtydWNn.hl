/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda`: This iterator searches for the first node named "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings, until it finds the first match. This is useful when you need to locate a specific node by name and you are unsure of its exact location in relation to the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all the children nodes of the "hyper2lambda" node. It is used when you want to access or manipulate all direct descendants of a particular node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to gather all the child nodes of a specific node named "hyper2lambda" for further processing or evaluation.
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you need to apply a transformation or extract data from all children of a node identified by the name "hyper2lambda".
