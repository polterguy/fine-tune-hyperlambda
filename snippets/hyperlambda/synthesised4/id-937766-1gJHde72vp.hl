// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [convert] slot to change the type of a node's value to a float. The [convert] slot takes an expression pointing to the node whose value you want to convert, and a [type] argument specifying the target type. In this example, the value of the node referenced by the expression is converted to a float type.
convert:x:-
   type:float
