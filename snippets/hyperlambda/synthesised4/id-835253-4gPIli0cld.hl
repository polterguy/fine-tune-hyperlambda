// This code snippet uses the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate a series of strings, including a static string and the value of a node referenced by a lambda expression. The result is a single string that begins with "Vectorizing: ", followed by the value of the [prompt] node, and ends with a double quote. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [prompt] node, which is part of the node currently iterated by reference through [.dp].
