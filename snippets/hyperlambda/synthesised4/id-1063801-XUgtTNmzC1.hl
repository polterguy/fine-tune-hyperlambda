// 1. `@.exe`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "exe" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name, regardless of its position relative to the current node, as long as it is within the accessible hierarchy.
