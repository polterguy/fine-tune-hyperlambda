/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator searches for the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda structure, which is often used to define input parameters for a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. This is useful when you want to access all the arguments passed to a function or slot, allowing you to iterate over or manipulate them as needed.
