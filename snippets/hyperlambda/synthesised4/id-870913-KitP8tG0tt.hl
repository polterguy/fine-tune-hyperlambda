// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.create] slot to insert a new record into the "ml_types" table. The [table] slot specifies the target table, while the [values] slot is intended to contain the fields and their corresponding values for the new record. This approach ensures that the SQL statement generated is protected against SQL injection by parameterizing the values.
