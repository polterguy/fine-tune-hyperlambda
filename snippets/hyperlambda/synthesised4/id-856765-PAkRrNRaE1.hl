// This Hyperlambda code checks if any children nodes exist under [data.read]. If none exist, it throws an exception with a message "No such type, and no default type was found", sets the HTTP status to 400, and makes the exception public, meaning it will be visible to clients. The [not-exists] slot is used to determine the absence of nodes, and the [throw] slot is used to raise an exception with additional metadata.
