// This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to perform a SQL read operation on a SQLite database, specifically targeting a table named "leads". The operation includes a left join with another table, "clients", using the "client_id" field as a common reference point. The join is aliased as "client_id" and the join condition is specified to match the "client_id" fields from both tables. The code also specifies columns to be aggregated, with the result being aliased as "result". A "where" clause is included, although it appears to be incomplete or a placeholder for additional conditions. The operation further includes a "group by" clause on a specified "group_column". Finally, the code returns the nodes resulting from the data read operation, effectively allowing for the retrieval of processed data from the database. This setup is useful for querying and aggregating data across related tables in a database, providing a structured way to handle complex SQL operations within Hyperlambda.
