/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda) of its previous result set. It is used to move from the current node to the next node in the sequence. This can be useful when you want to access a node that is structurally parallel to the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all the child nodes of the current node, allowing for operations on multiple nodes at once. This is useful when you need to process or evaluate all child nodes of a given parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `.sse` - This iterator filters the previous result set to include only nodes named `.sse`. It is used to narrow down the node set to nodes with a specific name, which is useful for targeting specific data or functionality encapsulated within nodes named `.sse`.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It allows further traversal into the node hierarchy, accessing all child nodes of the `.sse` nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `.session` - This iterator filters the previous result set to include only nodes named `.session`. It is used to further narrow down the node set to nodes with this specific name, which can be useful for accessing session-related data or operations encapsulated within nodes named `.session`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include accessing session data within a streaming server environment (indicated by `.sse` which might stand for Server-Sent Events), or processing session-specific operations in a structured data hierarchy.
