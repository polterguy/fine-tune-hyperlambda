/*
 * The code demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement with multiple [case] slots to handle different scenarios based on the value of a node. Each [case] slot checks for a specific value and executes its associated lambda if the condition is met. If none of the [case] conditions are satisfied, the [default] slot executes its lambda. This structure allows for organized and efficient conditional branching based on discrete values.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Initiates a switch statement to evaluate different cases.
 * 2. [case] - Checks for a specific value and executes its associated lambda if the condition is met.
 * 3. [default] - Executes its lambda if none of the [case] conditions are satisfied.
