/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing the root arguments node in a Hyperlambda execution context, typically used in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints to access input parameters.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node(s). In this context, it retrieves all children of the "arguments" node, which are typically the parameters passed to a slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `connectionString` - This iterator filters the previously selected nodes to only include those with the name "connectionString". It is used to specifically access the "connectionString" parameter within the arguments, which might be used for database connections or other configurations requiring a connection string.
