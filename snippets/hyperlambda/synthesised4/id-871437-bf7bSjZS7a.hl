// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from an SQLite database by joining two tables, "contacts" and "clients", using a left join on the "client_id". It selects an aggregated column, aliases it as "result", and limits the result set to one record. The [data.read] slot specifies the database type and table, while [join] and [columns] define the join condition and selected columns respectively.
