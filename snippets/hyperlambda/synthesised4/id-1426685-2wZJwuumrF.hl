/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read specific columns from a database table with a conditional filter. It connects to a database, selects the "greeting" and "recaptcha" columns from the "ml_types" table, and applies a "where" condition to filter the results based on the "type" argument provided. The condition checks for equality between the "type" column in the database and the "type" argument passed in. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.read] - Initiates a read operation from the database.
 * 2. [table] - Specifies the table "ml_types" from which to read data.
 * 3. [columns] - Lists the columns "greeting" and "recaptcha" to be retrieved.
 * 4. [where] - Begins the conditional filtering section.
 * 5. [and] - Logical operator indicating all conditions must be true.
 * 6. [type.eq] - Compares the "type" column in the table to the "type" argument, ensuring they are equal.
