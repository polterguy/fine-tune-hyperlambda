// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds nodes from the result of an [execute-file] invocation to a specified location. The [add] slot appends nodes to the path given in its expression, while [get-nodes] retrieves nodes from the [execute-file] result. The [execute-file] slot executes a file and returns its nodes, which are then added to the target location by [add].
