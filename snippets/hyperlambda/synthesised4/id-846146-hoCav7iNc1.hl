// This Hyperlambda snippet uses the [else] slot to execute a block of code when all preceding conditional checks have failed. In this case, it increments the value of the [.below-threshold] node by 1 using the [math.increment] slot. The [else] slot ensures that the increment operation occurs only if no prior conditions were met.
