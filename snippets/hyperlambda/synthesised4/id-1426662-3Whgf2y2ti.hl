/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code checks if the system has the capability to perform time-shifting operations on logs. If the capability exists, it adds various time-shift categories to a lambda object, each with a name, description, and an empty items list. It then logs specific events into the respective categories' items list, such as user authentication, access denial, successful and failed OpenAI API requests, and lead generation.
 * // 1. [if] - Checks if the system has the capability to time-shift logs.
 * // 2. [add] - Adds a structure for time-shift categories to a lambda object.
 * // 3. [timeshifts] - Root node for different time-shift categories.
 * // 4. [logins] - Category for successfully authenticated users.
 * // 5. [access_denied] - Category for access denied requests.
 * // 6. [openai_success] - Category for successful OpenAI API requests.
 * // 7. [openai_failure] - Category for failed OpenAI API requests.
 * // 8. [lead_generated] - Category for generated leads.
 * // 9. [add] - Adds log entries to the respective time-shift categories' items list.
 * // 10. [log.timeshift] - Logs specific events into the time-shift categories.
