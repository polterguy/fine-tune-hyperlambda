/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to set the value of a node named [.url] to the value obtained from a specific expression. The expression retrieves a value from a node structure, specifically from the first child node of a node named [src] within a certain context. The [else] block is executed only if preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions evaluate to false. The code effectively assigns a value to [.url] as a fallback operation when no other conditions are met.
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes its child nodes if no preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are true.
 * 2. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.url] node.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value from a specific node structure defined by the expression "@.dp/#/*/@src/[0,1]".
