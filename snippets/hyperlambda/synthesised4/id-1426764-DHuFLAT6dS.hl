// The [case] node is used within a [switch] block to define specific conditions that, when matched, execute the associated lambda object. The [case] node must have a value, which can be a constant or an expression, and it is compared against the evaluated value of the [switch] node. If a match is found, the corresponding [case] node is executed. If no [case] matches, and a [default] node is present, the [default] node is executed. The [switch] block is similar to a switch/case construct in traditional programming languages.
