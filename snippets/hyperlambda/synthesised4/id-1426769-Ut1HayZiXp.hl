 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot, which executes its child nodes if none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are met. In this example, if all previous conditional checks fail, it sets the value of the [type] node to "string" using the [set-value] slot. The [else] slot does not require a condition, and its child nodes are executed directly.
 * // 1. [else] - Executes its child nodes if no preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are true.
 * // 2. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [type] node to "string".
