// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using a left join between the "notes" and "clients" tables in a SQLite database. It specifies a distinct function as a column with an alias "count" and includes a placeholder for a "where" clause with logical conditions. The [data.read] slot initiates the query, [join] specifies the join type and conditions, [columns] defines the selected column with an alias, and [where] is prepared for additional filtering conditions.
