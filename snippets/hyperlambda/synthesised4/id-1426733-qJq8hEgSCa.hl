/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet modifies the value of a node by appending a formatted string to it. It uses the [set-value] slot to update the value of the node specified by the expression [@.dp/#/*/completion]. The new value is constructed using the [strings.concat] slot, which concatenates the current value of the node with two newline characters and a string that includes a URL. The URL is retrieved from the [.arguments/*/url] node using the [get-value] slot. This operation effectively appends a message to the existing node value, indicating that the information was sourced from a specific URL.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the node specified by the expression.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the current value of the node specified by the expression.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the URL from the [.arguments/*/url] node.
