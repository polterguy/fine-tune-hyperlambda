// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform SQL joins using the [data.read] slot with SQLite as the database type. It joins the "Order Details" table with the "Orders" and "Products" tables using left joins, specifying join conditions with the [on] and [and] slots. The [columns] slot selects distinct columns, and the [where] slot is prepared for additional filtering conditions. The [as] slot is used for aliasing joined tables.
