// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value associated with the key "magic:openai:key" from the application's configuration file, typically "appsettings.json". This key is likely used to store the OpenAI API key, which is necessary for integrating OpenAI services within the application. The [config.get] slot is used to access configuration settings, allowing the application to dynamically retrieve and utilize the API key without hardcoding it into the source code.
config.get:"magic:openai:key"
