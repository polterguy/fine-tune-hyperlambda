// This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL query to select all records from the "hyperlambda" table where the "code" column contains the string ".arguments", and both "is_static" and "synthesised" columns are equal to 0. The query uses parameters for pagination, with [@limit] and [@offset] being dynamically set from the [.arguments] node, allowing flexible control over the number of results returned and the starting point of the query.
data.select:"select * from hyperlambda where code like '%.arguments%' and is_static = 0 and synthesised = 0 limit @limit offset @offset"
   @limit:x:@.arguments/*/limit
   @offset:x:@.arguments/*/offset
