/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [success] node within [.arguments] is equal to "true". If the condition is met, it sets the value of the [status] node to "Operation completed successfully". The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, where the [eq] slot checks for equality, and [set-value] assigns a new value to the [status] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional check.
 * 2. [eq] - Compares the value of [success] to "true".
 * 3. [.lambda] - Executes its children if the condition is true.
 * 4. [set-value] - Sets the value of [status] to a success message.
