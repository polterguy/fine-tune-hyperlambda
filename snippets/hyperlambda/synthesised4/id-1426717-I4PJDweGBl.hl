/*
 * // The [context] slot in Hyperlambda allows you to add an object to the stack, which can later be retrieved using the [get-context] slot. This is useful for storing data that needs to be accessible throughout the execution of a Hyperlambda snippet without passing it as an argument to slots. The [context] slot requires a name as its value, a [value] node for the data to store, and a [.lambda] node for the lambda where the context exists. Below is a breakdown of the example code:
 * // 1. [.result] - A node intended to store the result of the operation.
 * // 2. [context:foo] - Declares a context object named "foo".
 * // 3. [value:bar] - Sets the value of the context object to "bar".
 * // 4. [.lambda] - Defines the lambda block where the context object is accessible.
 * // 5. [set-value:x:@.result] - Sets the value of the [.result] node.
 * // 6. [get-context:foo] - Retrieves the context object named "foo" from the stack.
