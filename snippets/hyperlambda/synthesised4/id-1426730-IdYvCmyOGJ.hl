/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert a new node into a specific location within a node structure. The [add] slot is used to append a node as a child to the nodes referenced in its expression. In this example, a new node with the name "sitemap" is added as a child to the nodes found by the expression [@try/*/return]. This allows you to dynamically modify the node structure by adding new elements to it.
 * // 1. [add:x:@try/*/return] - This slot appends a new node to the nodes referenced by the expression, which in this case are all [return] nodes that are children of any node under [try].
 * // 2. [.] - This node serves as a placeholder for the new child node being added.
 * // 3. [sitemap] - This is the name of the new node being added as a child to the referenced nodes.
