// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to select records from a database table named "shelter_animals" using the [data.read] slot. It applies a [where] condition to filter results, specifically selecting records where the "id" column matches the value of the "animal-id" argument passed to the lambda. The [and] slot ensures that multiple conditions can be added if needed.
data.read
   table:shelter_animals
