/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to navigate to the top of the node hierarchy, which can be useful when you need to access nodes that are at the root level or when you want to reset your navigation to the beginning of the structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it will retrieve all children nodes of the root node. This is useful when you want to perform operations on all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `.result` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "result". It is used to narrow down the node set to those nodes specifically named "result", which is useful when you are interested in processing or retrieving data from nodes with a specific name.
