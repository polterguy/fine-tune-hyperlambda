/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or slot, often found at the beginning of a Hyperlambda function or HTTP endpoint to define the expected input parameters.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node, which in this case is the "arguments" node. It is used to access all the parameters or arguments that are defined as children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `feedback-channel` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "feedback-channel" from the previously selected children nodes. It is used to specifically access the "feedback-channel" argument or parameter, which might be used to determine the channel through which feedback is communicated, such as email, SMS, etc.
