// The code uses the [neq] slot to compare the result of an HTTP GET request with the integer 200. It evaluates to true if the status code of the HTTP GET response is not equal to 200, indicating a non-successful HTTP response. The [neq] slot requires two arguments, the first being the result of the [http.get] invocation and the second being the static integer value 200.
