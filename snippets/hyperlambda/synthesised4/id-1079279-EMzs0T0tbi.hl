/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it looks for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for accessing the `.arguments` node, which typically contains input parameters or arguments for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node(s). In this context, it retrieves all children of the `.arguments` node. This is useful for accessing all argument nodes within the `.arguments` node, which might represent different parameters passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `/offset`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to find the first node with the name `offset`. It is used to specifically access the `offset` argument within the `.arguments` node, which could represent an offset value for pagination or data retrieval purposes.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a context where a function or endpoint needs to access an `offset` parameter from its input arguments, perhaps to determine the starting point for data retrieval in a paginated response.
