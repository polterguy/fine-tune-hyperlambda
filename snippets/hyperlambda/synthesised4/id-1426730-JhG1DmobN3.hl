// The [unwrap] slot in this Hyperlambda code is used to forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied as a value to unwrap itself. The expression "x:+/*/*" indicates that it will evaluate the node's elder sibling, then all its children, and then all their children, effectively traversing two levels down the hierarchy from the elder sibling of the current node. This allows for dynamic evaluation of nodes before the instruction pointer reaches them, enabling more flexible and dynamic code execution.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
