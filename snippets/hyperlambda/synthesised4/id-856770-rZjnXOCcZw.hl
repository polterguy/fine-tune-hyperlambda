 * The code sends a signal to users with the "root" role using [sockets.signal], transmitting a message indicating a non-transitional error during vectorization. It then sets the [.continue] node's value to false using [set-value], effectively halting further processing. 
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes the following slots if previous conditions were false.
 * 2. [sockets.signal] - Sends a message to specified roles.
 * 3. [roles] - Specifies the target role for the signal.
 * 4. [args] - Contains the message and type to be sent.
 * 5. [set-value] - Sets the value of [.continue] to false.
