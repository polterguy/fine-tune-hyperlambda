// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that it should start the search from the current node's context. This expression is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate a specific node named "sql" within the current scope, such as executing a SQL query or accessing SQL-related configurations or data.
