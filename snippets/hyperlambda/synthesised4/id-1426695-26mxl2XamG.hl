/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to update the value of a node by concatenating its current value with a new string extracted from a JSON-like structure. It uses the [set-value] slot to modify the [.result] node by appending the content retrieved from a specific path within a JSON structure, which is first converted to a lambda node set using [json2lambda]. The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate the current value of [.result] with the new content. The code effectively demonstrates how to dynamically update a node's value by combining existing data with new data extracted from a structured format.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the [.result] node by concatenating its current value with a new string.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.result] - Retrieves the current value of the [.result] node.
 * 4. [get-value:x:@json2lambda/*/choices/0/*/delta/*/content] - Extracts a specific string from a JSON-like structure converted to lambda, which is then concatenated to the [.result] node.
