/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "new-prompt" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located at a higher level in the node structure, allowing you to retrieve or manipulate its value or children nodes. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to dynamically access configuration or metadata stored in a "new-prompt" node, which might be required for conditional logic or further processing in a Hyperlambda script.
