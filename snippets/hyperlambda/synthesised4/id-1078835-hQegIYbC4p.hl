/*
 * 1. `@.result` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.result` in the current context. It is often used to access a specific node that holds a result or output from a previous operation. Use case: Accessing the result node to perform further operations on its children.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the `.result` node. It is used to access all direct child nodes of the `.result` node. Use case: Iterating over all child nodes of the result to perform operations on each.
 * 
 * 3. `paths` - This iterator filters the children of the `.result` node to only those named `paths`. It is used to narrow down the node set to specific nodes of interest. Use case: Accessing nodes specifically named `paths` for further processing.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the `paths` node. It is used to access all direct child nodes of the `paths` node. Use case: Iterating over all child nodes of the paths to perform operations on each.
 * 
 * 5. `{@strings.concat}` - This is an extrapolated expression that evaluates the result of the `strings.concat` slot. It is used to concatenate strings from the nodes retrieved by the previous iterators. Use case: Concatenating the values of nodes under `paths` to form a single string, possibly for output or further processing.
