/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if the value of the node referenced by the expression [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/column_default] is equal to an empty string. If the value is an empty string, the [eq] slot will evaluate to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [eq] - Compares two values for equality.
 * 2. [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/column_default] - Retrieves the value of the node located at the specified path, which is expected to be compared.
 * 3. [.:] - Represents an empty string to compare against the retrieved value.
