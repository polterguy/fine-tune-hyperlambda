/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. It is useful when you want to move to the node immediately following the current node at the same hierarchical level.
 * 
 * 2. `+` - This second `+` iterator again retrieves the elder sibling of the node obtained from the previous step. This effectively moves two nodes forward from the original starting point, staying at the same level of hierarchy.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous step. It is used when you want to access all the child nodes under a particular parent node.
 * 
 * 4. `headers` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "headers" from the children nodes obtained in the previous step. It is useful for accessing specific nodes by name within a set of children nodes.
