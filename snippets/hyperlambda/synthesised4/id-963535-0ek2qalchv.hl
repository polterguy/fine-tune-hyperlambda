// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the node referenced by [.dp] contains the substring "/ts-templates/". The [strings.contains] slot is used to perform this check, and it returns true if the specified substring is found within the referenced node's value. The expression [x:@.dp/#] is used to dereference the value of the [.dp] node.
