/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context with the name "signal". It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, looking for a node named "signal". This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name that might not be a direct child of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "signal" node. It is used when you want to perform operations or checks on all nodes that are direct children of the "signal" node.
 * 
 * 3. `cached` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "cached". It is used to narrow down the children of the "signal" node to those specifically named "cached".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in scenarios where you need to access or manipulate nodes that are children of a "signal" node and specifically named "cached". For example, it could be used in a caching mechanism to check or update cached data related to a signal processing task.
