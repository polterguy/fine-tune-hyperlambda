// 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context that has the name specified after the `@` symbol. In this case, it looks for the first node named "roles". This is useful for accessing specific nodes directly by their name, especially when you want to access a node that is not a direct child of the current node but exists somewhere in the hierarchy.
