// 1. `@.create-database-script` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "create-database-script" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. This is useful when you want to access a specific node that is an ancestor of the current node, possibly to retrieve or manipulate its value or children nodes.
