// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [remove-nodes] slot to delete specific nodes from a node set. It targets and removes all nodes named "keyword_density" that are descendants of nodes returned by the expression [@data.select/*/*]. The expression navigates through the node hierarchy to find and remove the specified nodes, effectively cleaning up the data structure by eliminating unwanted elements.
