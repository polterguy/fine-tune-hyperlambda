/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It's typically used to locate the arguments node in a Hyperlambda structure, which is crucial for accessing input parameters in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It's used to access the parameters passed to the slot or endpoint, allowing further filtering or operations on these parameters.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `session`. It's used to specifically access the session-related parameter within the arguments, which could be used for session management, authentication, or maintaining state across requests.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a session token or ID passed as an argument to an HTTP endpoint for user authentication.
 * - Retrieving session-specific data to maintain state or preferences for a user session in a web application.
