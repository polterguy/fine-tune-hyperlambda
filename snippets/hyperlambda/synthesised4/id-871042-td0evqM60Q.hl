// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.result] node to a concatenated string. It uses the [strings.concat] slot to combine a static string containing a multi-line comment, which is automatically generated by Magic, and assigns it to [.result]. The [set-value] slot is used to update the node's value with the concatenated result.
