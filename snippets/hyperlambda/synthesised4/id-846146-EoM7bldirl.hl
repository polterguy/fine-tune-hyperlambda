// The [type] slot in Hyperlambda returns the type name of a node's value. In this example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer value of 57, and the [type] slot is used to retrieve the type of this value, which is "int". The [type] slot is useful for dynamically determining the data type of a node's value within a Hyperlambda script.
