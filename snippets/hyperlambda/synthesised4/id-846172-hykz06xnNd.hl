// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used to define a specific case within a [switch] statement, allowing for conditional branching based on the value of a node. By using [case], you can execute different blocks of code depending on which case matches the value being evaluated. This is particularly useful for handling multiple potential values and executing corresponding logic for each one.
