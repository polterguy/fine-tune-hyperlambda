// This Hyperlambda code checks if either the disk space is less than 50 or the network is not available. If either condition is true, it sets the result to indicate that the backup was skipped due to low disk space or no network. The [if] slot evaluates the [or] condition, which contains [lt] and [eq] slots to perform the checks.
