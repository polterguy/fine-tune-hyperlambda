 * 1. `@.greeting`: This iterator searches for the first node named "greeting" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve a greeting message or text that is defined in a node named "greeting" somewhere in the hierarchy. 
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you want to display a greeting message based on the context or location within the node structure, such as displaying a welcome message in a web application or a personalized greeting in a user interface.
