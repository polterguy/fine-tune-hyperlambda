/*
 * 1. `@.system` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "system" that is found in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a match.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "system" node. It does not filter by name, so it includes every child node regardless of their names.
 * 3. `{@get-name}` - This is an extrapolated expression that dynamically evaluates the expression within the curly braces. The `@get-name` part suggests that it retrieves the first node with the name "get-name" in the current context. The result of this evaluation is used to filter the children nodes retrieved by the `*` iterator. This means that only the children nodes of "system" that match the evaluated result of `@get-name` are selected. This is useful for dynamically filtering nodes based on some computed or retrieved value.
