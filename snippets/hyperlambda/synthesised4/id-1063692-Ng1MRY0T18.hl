/*
 * 1. `@crypto.rsa.create-key` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "crypto.rsa.create-key". It is used to locate the node where the RSA key creation process is defined or executed. This is typically the starting point for accessing the results of the RSA key creation.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "crypto.rsa.create-key" node. It is used to access any nodes that are direct children of the RSA key creation node, which might include details about the key, such as its components or metadata.
 * 
 * 3. `private` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "private". It is used to specifically access the private key component of the RSA key pair. This is crucial for operations that require the private key, such as decryption or signing data.
