// This Hyperlambda code checks if a user has roles and if a specific type does not exist in a model. If both conditions are true, it adds nodes from a data source into a model. The [if] slot evaluates two conditions using [and]: [exists] checks for roles in the authenticated user's ticket, and [not-exists] verifies the absence of a type in the model. If both conditions are satisfied, the [.lambda] block executes, using [add] to insert nodes obtained from [get-nodes] into the [.models] node.
