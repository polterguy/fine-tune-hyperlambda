// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda evaluates expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions. By using [unwrap:x:+/*], it evaluates all sibling nodes of the current node, effectively "unwrapping" their values before execution continues. This is useful for dynamically resolving expressions in a lambda object.
unwrap:x:+/*
