/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [max_context_tokens] node, which is a child of the [model] node, to the result of a division operation. The division operation's result is obtained from the [math.divide] slot, which is executed prior to setting the value. This allows dynamic calculation and assignment of values based on mathematical operations. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of a node.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the result of the division operation from [math.divide].
 * 3. [math.divide] - Performs a division operation whose result is used to set the value.
