/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "sql" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds the first match. This is useful for accessing a specific node that contains SQL-related data or instructions, which might be needed for executing a database query or processing SQL commands.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a SQL query string from a configuration or data node to execute it against a database.
 * - Accessing SQL-related settings or parameters that are defined in a higher-level node within the same Hyperlambda graph.
