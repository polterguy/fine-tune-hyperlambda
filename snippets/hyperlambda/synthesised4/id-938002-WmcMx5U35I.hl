// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes to a destination node. In this example, it adds a node with a value derived from a reference to the currently iterated node's value, effectively duplicating the value of the iterated node into the [.urls] node. The [add] slot takes the destination node as its main argument and appends the children nodes specified in its body.
