// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions. The first condition checks if the node referenced by [.dp] has a non-null value using [not-null]. The second condition uses [neq] to verify that the value of the node referenced by [.dp] is not equal to an empty value. Both conditions must be true for the [and] slot to evaluate to true.
