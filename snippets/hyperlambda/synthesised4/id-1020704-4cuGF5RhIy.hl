/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator finds the first node named `.arguments` in the current execution context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the dot preceding `arguments` specifies that it is a direct child of the root node or a node at the same level in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the `.arguments` node. It expands the selection to include every child node under `.arguments`, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `[1,1000]` - This iterator selects a subset of the nodes obtained from the previous step. It starts from the second node (index 1, as indexing is zero-based) and includes up to 1000 nodes in the selection. This is useful for pagination or processing a specific range of nodes when dealing with large datasets.
