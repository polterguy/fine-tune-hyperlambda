// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to select records from a database table named "crash_reports". The [table] slot specifies the table from which to retrieve data. By default, this will return up to 25 records unless a [limit] argument is provided to override this behavior.
data.read
   table:crash_reports
