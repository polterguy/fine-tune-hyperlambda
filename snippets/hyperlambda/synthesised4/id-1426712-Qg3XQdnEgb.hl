// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [supervised] exists within the [.arguments] node, is not null, and its value can be converted to an integer equal to 1. The [and] slot ensures that all these conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. The [exists] slot checks for the presence of the [supervised] node, [not-null] ensures it has a non-null value, and [eq] verifies that the converted integer value of [supervised] is 1.
