// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [validators.mandatory] slot in Hyperlambda to ensure that a specific argument, named "threshold", is provided. If the "threshold" argument is missing or has a null value, the [validators.mandatory] slot will throw an exception, enforcing the requirement that this argument must be supplied with a non-null value. This is useful for validating that essential parameters are present before proceeding with further logic in the Hyperlambda script.
