 * // This Hyperlambda code evaluates a logical condition using the [and] slot. It checks if two conditions are true: 
 * // 1. The node [.relevant] is equal to the boolean value true.
 * // 2. The node [.value] is not equal to a specified value (which is not provided in this snippet).
 * // The [and] slot ensures that both conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true.
 * // [and] - Combines multiple conditions and evaluates to true if all conditions are true.
 * // [eq] - Checks if the value of the [.relevant] node is equal to true.
 * // [neq] - Checks if the value of the [.value] node is not equal to a specified value.
