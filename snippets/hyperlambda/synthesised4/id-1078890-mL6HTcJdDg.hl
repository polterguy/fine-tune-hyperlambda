/*
 * 1. `@.page-header` - This iterator searches for the first node named "page-header" that is an ancestor or sibling of the current node. It starts the search from the current node's position in the hierarchy and moves upwards or sideways to find the node with the specified name.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "page-header" node. It does not filter by name or value, so it includes every direct child node under "page-header".
 * 
 * 3. `h3` - This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to include only nodes named "h3". It effectively narrows down the selection to nodes that are children of "page-header" and have the name "h3".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to extract or manipulate all "h3" elements within a "page-header" section of a document or webpage. For example, it might be used in a web scraping or document parsing scenario where you need to gather all subheadings within a specific section of a page.
 * - It could also be used in a content management system to apply styles or modifications to specific subheadings within a page header dynamically.
