// The Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.split] slot to split the string value of the node referenced by the expression [@.result] into multiple parts, using the sequence of underscores (___) as the delimiter. Each segment of the original string, separated by the delimiter, becomes a separate node in the resulting node set.
