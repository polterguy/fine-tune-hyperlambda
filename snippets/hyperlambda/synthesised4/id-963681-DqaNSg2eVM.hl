// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [if] and [not-null] slots in Hyperlambda. It checks if any child node named "foo" under the [.data] node has a non-null value using [not-null]. If this condition is true, the [if] slot executes its [.lambda] block, which raises an exception with the message "You are not supposed to be here!" using the [throw] slot.

   not-null:x:@.data/*/foo

      throw:You are not supposed to be here!
