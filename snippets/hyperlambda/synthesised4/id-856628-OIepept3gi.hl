// The code snippet checks if the value of the [.db-type] node is equal to "sqlite". It uses the [eq] slot to perform this equality comparison, which evaluates to true only if the two compared values are exactly the same. This is useful for conditionally executing code based on the database type being used.
eq:x:@.db-type
