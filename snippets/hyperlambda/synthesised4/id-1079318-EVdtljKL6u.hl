/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to access the arguments passed to the current Hyperlambda execution context.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It allows you to access any argument nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 3. `order` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "order". It is used to specifically target the "order" argument within the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to access a specific argument named "order" that is passed to a Hyperlambda function or endpoint. For example, it could be used in a function that processes orders, where you need to retrieve the order details from the input arguments.
