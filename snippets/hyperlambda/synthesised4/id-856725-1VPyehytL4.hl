// This Hyperlambda code snippet converts the value of a node, specifically the count of records retrieved from a database query, into an integer type. It uses the [convert] slot to transform the value pointed to by the expression [@data.connect/*/data.read/*/*/count] into an integer, ensuring the data type is suitable for further numerical operations or comparisons.
