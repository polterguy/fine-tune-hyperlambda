// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes to a destination node's children collection. It uses an expression to specify the destination node and retrieves nodes from a signal using [get-nodes]. The [add] slot appends the retrieved nodes to the destination node's children collection. The expression in [add] targets the next sibling node, while [get-nodes] retrieves nodes from the signal node's children.
