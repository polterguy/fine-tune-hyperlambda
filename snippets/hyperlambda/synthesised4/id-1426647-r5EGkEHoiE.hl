// This Hyperlambda code checks if there are any [yield], [return], or [return-nodes] slots within the [hyper2lambda] node and ensures that these slots do not have any children nodes. It uses the [exists] slot to verify the presence of these slots and the [not-exists] slot to confirm that none of them have children.
