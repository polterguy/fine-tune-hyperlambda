/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named ".arguments" from the current context. In the context of an HTTP endpoint, the [.arguments] node typically contains the arguments passed to the endpoint, such as headers, query parameters, etc.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. In this case, it will return all nodes under [.arguments], which may include nodes like headers, query parameters, etc.
 * 
 * 3. `headers` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "headers". This is typically where HTTP headers are stored within the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "headers" node. This will return all individual header nodes, each representing a specific HTTP header and its value.
 * 
 * This expression is used to access all HTTP headers passed to an endpoint, allowing for operations such as logging, validation, or conditional logic based on header values.
