// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-x] slot to modify the type of nodes in a Hyperlambda graph. It retrieves nodes using a complex expression, converts their values using [strings.concat], and changes their type to "x". The [set-x] slot is used to set the type of nodes, while [convert] and [strings.concat] are used to manipulate node values.
set-x:x:+/*/*/exists
   convert:x:@strings.concat
      type:x
