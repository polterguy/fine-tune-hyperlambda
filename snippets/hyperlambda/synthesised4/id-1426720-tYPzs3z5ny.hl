/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot in Hyperlambda to retrieve the type of a node's value. It starts by declaring a node [.foo] with an integer value of 57. The [type] slot is then used with an expression pointing to the previous node to determine its type. After execution, the [type] slot will return "int" as the type of the [.foo] node's value.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type of the value of the previous node.
