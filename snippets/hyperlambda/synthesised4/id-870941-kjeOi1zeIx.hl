// The Hyperlambda code uses the [type] slot to determine and return the type of a node's value. In this example, the [type] slot is applied to a node with an integer value, and it will return "int" as the type name. The [type] slot is useful for dynamically checking the data type of a node's value in Hyperlambda scripts.
