/*
 * 1. `@.loc`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "loc" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. The `@` symbol is used to search for nodes by name, and the `.` indicates that the search is relative to the current node. This expression is useful for accessing a specific node named "loc" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or context-specific data stored in a "loc" node that is defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure.
 * - Retrieving location-specific information or metadata that is stored in a node named "loc" for further processing or decision-making.
