// This Hyperlambda code updates the "users" table by setting the "password" field to the value of the [.password] node for the user whose username matches the currently authenticated user. It uses the [data.update] slot to perform the update operation, specifying the [table] to update, the [values] to set, and a [where] clause to filter the records based on the [username.eq] condition, which retrieves the username from the [auth.ticket.get] slot.
