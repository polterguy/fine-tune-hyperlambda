// This Hyperlambda code uses the [add] slot to append nodes to multiple destination nodes specified by the expression "../*/return/*/candidates". Each added node contains three child nodes: [name] and [expression], both referencing the value of the node [x], and [complete] with a boolean value set to true. This structure is useful for dynamically adding structured data to multiple locations in a Hyperlambda graph.
