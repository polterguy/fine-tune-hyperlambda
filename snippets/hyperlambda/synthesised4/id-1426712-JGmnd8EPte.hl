 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds nodes from a specified location to another location within a node structure. It uses the [add] slot to insert nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot. Specifically, it targets nodes located at the path "../*/return/*/references" and adds nodes found at the path "@signal/*/snippets/*". 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts nodes into the specified destination path.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the specified source path to be added.
