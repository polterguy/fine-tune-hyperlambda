/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context with the name "signal". It is used to locate a specific node by its name within the current hierarchy. This is useful when you want to start your search from a known node name.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "signal" node. It allows you to access every child node under "signal", regardless of their names. This is useful for iterating over or processing all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `cached` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "cached" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to pinpoint nodes with a specific name among the children of the "signal" node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used to find and process nodes named "cached" that are children of a node named "signal". For example, it could be used in a caching mechanism where you need to update or clear cached data associated with a specific signal.
 * - Another use case might be in a logging system where you want to retrieve and analyze cached log entries related to a particular signal or event.
