/*
 * This Hyperlambda code constructs a URL by concatenating parts of a string. It uses [set-value] to assign a value to the [.base] node. The value is created by [strings.concat], which combines the first part of a split string, a static string "://", and another part of the split string. The [get-value] slots retrieve specific segments from the split string to be concatenated.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Assigns a new value to the [.base] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into a single string.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@strings.split/@strings.split/0] - Retrieves the first segment of a split string.
 * 4. [.:"://"] - Static string used as a separator in the URL.
 * 5. [get-value:x:@strings.split/0] - Retrieves another segment of the split string.
