/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument that has been passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `semantics` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "semantics". It is used to specifically target and retrieve the "semantics" argument from the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to retrieve the value of a specific argument named "semantics" that has been passed to it. This is useful in scenarios where the function needs to perform operations based on the semantics or meaning of the data it is processing.
