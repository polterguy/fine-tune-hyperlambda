/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specified substring within a string with another string. The code retrieves the value of the [start] node from the [.arguments] node and uses it as the replacement target. The [strings.replace] slot is applied to the [result] node, replacing occurrences of the substring specified by the [start] node with the value retrieved from the [.arguments] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.replace] - This slot is used to replace occurrences of a substring within a string.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [start] node from the [.arguments] node to be used as the replacement target.
