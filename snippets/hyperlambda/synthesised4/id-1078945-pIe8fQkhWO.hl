/*
 * 1. `@.invoke` - This iterator looks for the first node with the name "invoke" starting from the current node and traversing upwards in the hierarchy. It is useful for locating a specific node in a parent or ancestor context, often used to find where a particular invocation or operation begins.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "invoke" node. It is useful for accessing all direct child nodes of a particular parent node, allowing you to perform operations or checks on each child.
 * 
 * 3. `.finish_reason` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "finish_reason" among the children of the "invoke" node. It is typically used to find specific information or metadata related to the completion or termination of a process or operation, such as the reason why a task or function finished.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression could be used in a logging or auditing system to track why certain operations or processes were completed, allowing for better debugging or analysis.
 * - It might be used in a workflow or task management system to determine the outcome or status of invoked tasks, helping to automate decision-making processes based on the reasons provided.
