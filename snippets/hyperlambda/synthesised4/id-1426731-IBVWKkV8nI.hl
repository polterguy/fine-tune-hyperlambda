/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to update the value of a node. The code sets the value of the [.url] node to the value obtained from the [.dp] node, which is passed by reference. This is useful for dynamically updating node values based on other node references.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.url] node.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value from the [.dp] node by reference.
