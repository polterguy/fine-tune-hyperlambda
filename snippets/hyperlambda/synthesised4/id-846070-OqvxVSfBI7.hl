// This Hyperlambda code uses the [not] slot to negate the result of the [exists] slot, effectively checking if the node specified by the expression does not exist. If the node [.arguments/*/semantics] does not exist, the condition evaluates to true. This is useful for conditionally executing code when a specific node is absent.
