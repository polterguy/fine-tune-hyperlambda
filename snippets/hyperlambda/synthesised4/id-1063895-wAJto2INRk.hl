/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is commonly used to access the arguments node in Hyperlambda, which typically contains input parameters or configuration data for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node, which in this case is the "arguments" node. It allows you to access any child node under "arguments" without filtering by name.
 * 
 * 3. `databaseType` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved node set to only include nodes named "databaseType". It is used to specifically access the "databaseType" node within the children of the "arguments" node, which likely contains information about the type of database being used or configured.
