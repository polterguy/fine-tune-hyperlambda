// This Hyperlambda code constructs an SQL query string to retrieve SQL statements for tables with a specific name from the SQLite master table. The [set-value] slot assigns the resulting query to the [.sql] node, using [strings.concat] to concatenate the SQL string. The query filters by table type and a parameterized table name, enhancing security by preventing SQL injection.
