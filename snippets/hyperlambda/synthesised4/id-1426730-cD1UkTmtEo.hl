/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet inserts a new node structure before the [return] node within a [try] block. The new node structure consists of a [sitemap] node, which in turn has a value derived from the result of a [strings.concat] operation. The [strings.concat] operation is expected to concatenate a list of strings into one string, and its result is used as the value for the [sitemap] node. The code effectively adds a sitemap node with a dynamically generated value to the execution flow within a try block. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts nodes before the specified destination node.
 * 2. [x:@try/*/return] - Expression pointing to the [return] node within a [try] block.
 * 3. [.] - Parent node for the nodes to be inserted.
 * 4. [sitemap] - New node being inserted.
 * 5. [.:x:@strings.concat] - Value of the [sitemap] node, derived from a [strings.concat] operation.
