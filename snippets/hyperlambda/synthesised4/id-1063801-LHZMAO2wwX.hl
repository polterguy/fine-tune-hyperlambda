/*
 * 1. `@.reference` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "reference" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary, ensuring that it finds the closest "reference" node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "reference" node. It allows access to every direct child node under "reference", regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `url` - This iterator filters the results from the previous step to only include nodes named "url". It ensures that only nodes with the name "url" are selected from the children of the "reference" node.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is useful when you need to access a URL associated with a specific reference in a hierarchical data structure. It efficiently navigates through the hierarchy to find and return the desired "url" node.
