/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda) of the current node. It is used to navigate to the next node in the sequence, which can be useful when you want to process nodes in a specific order or need to access the subsequent node for further operations.
 * 
 * 2. `+` - Another elder sibling iterator, moving to the next node again. This might be used in scenarios where you need to skip a node or access a node that is two positions away from the starting node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is useful when you want to perform operations on all child nodes, such as iterating over them or applying a transformation.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Another children iterator, further delving into the hierarchy to access deeper levels of child nodes. This is often used in nested structures where multiple levels of children need to be accessed or manipulated.
 * 
 * 5. `.sse` - This retrieves the parent node of the current result set that has the name `.sse`. It is used to find a specific node in the hierarchy, which is particularly useful when you need to access a node with a known name that is a parent of the current context.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the `.sse` node. This is useful for accessing all elements within a specific parent node, allowing for operations on multiple child nodes.
 * 
 * 7. `.type` - This retrieves the parent node of the current result set that has the name `.type`. It is used to find a specific node in the hierarchy, which is particularly useful when you need to access a node with a known name that is a parent of the current context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to navigate through a structured data set where you need to access specific nodes at various levels of the hierarchy. For example, it could be used in a configuration file parser to locate and process nodes related to a specific feature or setting.
 * - It might also be useful in scenarios where data transformation or extraction is needed from a complex nested data structure, allowing for targeted access to nodes of interest.
