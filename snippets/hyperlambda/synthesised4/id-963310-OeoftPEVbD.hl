// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [fork] slot to execute an HTTP GET request asynchronously. By using [fork], the HTTP request to "https://servergardens.com" is executed in a separate thread, allowing the main thread to continue processing without waiting for the HTTP request to complete. This approach is useful for improving performance and responsiveness in applications that require concurrent operations.
fork
