// This Hyperlambda code connects to the "authDB" database and executes an SQL update statement to set the "last_login" field to NULL for all records in the "users" table where the "active" field is equal to 0. The [data.connect] slot establishes the database connection, and the [data.execute] slot performs the update operation without expecting a return result.
data.connect:authDB
   data.execute:UPDATE users SET last_login = NULL WHERE active = 0
