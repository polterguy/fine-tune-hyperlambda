// The code retrieves the text content of a node by evaluating the expression provided. It uses the [get-value] slot to access the value of a node identified by its expression, which navigates through the node hierarchy to locate the specific text content. The expression uses iterators to traverse the node structure, ultimately extracting the text value from the targeted node.
