// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node in the current context with the name "sql". It uses the `@` symbol to indicate that it should search for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that it should start the search from the current node's context. This expression is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate a node named "sql" within the current execution context. A potential use case could be to execute a SQL query stored in a node named "sql" or to retrieve configuration or connection details related to SQL operations.
