// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [case] slot to add nodes to a specified destination. The [add] slot is used to append two nodes, [tokens] and [chat], to the node referenced by the expression in its value. The [tokens] node is assigned an integer value of 8192, and the [chat] node is assigned a boolean value of true. The [x:@.dp/#] expression is used to determine the destination node for the addition.
