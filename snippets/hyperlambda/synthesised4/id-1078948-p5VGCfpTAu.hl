/*
 * 1. `@.model`: This iterator searches for the first node named "model" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you need to find a specific node by name within the current execution context.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the node(s) found by the previous iterator. In this case, it will retrieve all children of the "model" node. This is useful when you need to process or evaluate all child nodes of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `model`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "model" among the children retrieved by the `*` iterator. This is useful when you are interested in specific child nodes with a particular name.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a hierarchical data structure with multiple "model" nodes, and you need to access or manipulate the child nodes of a specific "model" node within the current context. For example, it could be used to extract configuration settings or parameters defined under a "model" node in a machine learning application.
