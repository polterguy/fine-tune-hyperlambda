// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to insert a new record into the "users" table using the [mssql.create] slot. The [return-id] argument is set to false, indicating that the ID of the inserted record should not be returned. The [values] node specifies the fields and their corresponding values to be inserted: "username" as "johndoe", "email" as "john@example.com", and "is_active" as true. This ensures that the data is safely inserted into the database while protecting against SQL injection attacks.
