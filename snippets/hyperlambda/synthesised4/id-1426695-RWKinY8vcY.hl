 * The code checks if a specific node exists, is not null, and is not equal to an empty string. It uses [and] to ensure all conditions are true, [exists] to verify the node's presence, [not-null] to confirm it has a value, and [neq] to check it's not an empty string.
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Ensures all conditions are true.
 * 2. [exists] - Checks if the node exists.
 * 3. [not-null] - Confirms the node has a value.
 * 4. [neq] - Verifies the node's value is not an empty string.
