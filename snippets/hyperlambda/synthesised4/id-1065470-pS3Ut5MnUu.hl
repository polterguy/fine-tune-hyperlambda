// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol signifies that it will search for a node with the specified name. The `.` before `sql` indicates that it will look for this node in the current level of the hierarchy, meaning it will not traverse siblings or ancestors, but only the direct children of the current node. This type of expression is useful when you want to directly access a specific node by name within the current context, such as retrieving a SQL query or command stored in a node named "sql".
