// The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to declare a node's type as "error". This can be useful for explicitly marking nodes that are intended to represent error messages or error states in your Hyperlambda logic. By using the [type] slot, you can ensure that the node is treated as an error type, which may affect how it is processed or logged within your application.
