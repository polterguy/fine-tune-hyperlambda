/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator searches for the first node with the specified name, which in this case is "result". It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds the node named "result". This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located at different levels in the hierarchy but is guaranteed to be unique or the first occurrence.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a result node that contains the outcome of a computation or process, which might be located at various levels in the hierarchy.
 * - Accessing a node that stores a status or flag, which is used to determine the flow of execution in the Hyperlambda code.
