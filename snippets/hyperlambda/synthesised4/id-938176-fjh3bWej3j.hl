// The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to determine the type of a node's value. It initializes a node [.foo] with an integer value of 57, and then uses the [type] slot to return the type name of the value. The [type] slot is useful for identifying the data type of a node's value, which can be crucial for type-specific operations or validations.
