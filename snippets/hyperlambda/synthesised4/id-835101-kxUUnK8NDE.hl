// The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [return] slot to return a single node with a value. The [return] slot is used to exit from a dynamic slot or a context that allows returning values, and it returns a node named [result] with the value "success". This is typically used to signal the successful completion of a process or operation.
