/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It is used to navigate to the next node below the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. This can be useful when you want to access or manipulate data or slots that are defined immediately after the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, which is useful when you need to perform operations on or evaluate all child nodes collectively.
 * 
 * 3. `/.lambda` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node and then filters for a child node named `.lambda`. It is used to find a specific child node named `.lambda` from the parent node, which is often used to define a block of code or logic to be executed conditionally or in a loop.
 * 
 * 4. `/*` - This iterator again retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used here to access all direct descendants of the `.lambda` node, allowing operations or evaluations on all child nodes within the `.lambda` block.
 * 
 * 5. `/.url` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node and then filters for a child node named `.url`. It is used to find a specific child node named `.url` from the parent node, which is often used to define a URL or endpoint within a block of code, possibly for HTTP requests or API interactions.
