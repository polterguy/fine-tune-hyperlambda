// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to execute a MySQL query by loading it from a file. The [mysql.execute] slot is used to execute SQL commands, and the [io.file.load] slot is used to load the SQL query from a specified file path. The [x:@io.file.load] expression indicates that the content loaded from the file will be used as the SQL command to be executed. This approach is useful for executing complex SQL queries stored in external files, allowing for better organization and management of SQL scripts.
mysql.execute:x:@io.file.load
