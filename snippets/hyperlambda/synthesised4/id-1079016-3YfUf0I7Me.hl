/*
 * 1. `@.function-result`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "function-result" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is located higher up in the structure, such as retrieving the result of a function execution that is stored in a node named "function-result". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing the result of a previously executed function within a larger Hyperlambda script.
 * - Retrieving a value that is stored in a specific node after a series of operations, allowing for further processing or decision-making based on that value.
