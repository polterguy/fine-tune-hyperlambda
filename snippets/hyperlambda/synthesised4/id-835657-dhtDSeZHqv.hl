// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [remove-nodes] slot to delete specific nodes from a data structure. It targets nodes named "keyword_density" within a nested structure under [data.select]. The expression [x:@data.select/*/*/keyword_density] specifies the path to these nodes, ensuring that any node matching this path is removed from the hierarchy. This operation is useful for cleaning up or modifying data structures by eliminating unwanted elements.
remove-nodes:x:@data.select/*/*/keyword_density
