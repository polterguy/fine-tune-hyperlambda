// 1. `@.finish_reason`: This iterator looks for the first node named "finish_reason" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located at various levels above the current node, such as retrieving a status or reason code in a workflow or process execution.
