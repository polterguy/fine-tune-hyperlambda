// The code snippet uses the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions: whether the value of the node [isActive] and the value of the node [isPaid] are both true. If both conditions evaluate to true, the [and] slot will return true, otherwise, it will return false. This logical operation is useful for ensuring that multiple conditions are met simultaneously.
