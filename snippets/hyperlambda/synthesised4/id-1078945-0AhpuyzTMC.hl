/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "new-prompt" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node named "new-prompt". This is useful when you need to access a specific node in the hierarchy without knowing its exact position relative to the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: You might use this expression to retrieve configuration settings or parameters stored in a node named "new-prompt" that are applicable to the current execution context.
