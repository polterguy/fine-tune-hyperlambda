// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to add nodes to a destination node's children collection. If the preceding conditions in an [if] or [else-if] block evaluate to false, the [else] block executes, using the [add] slot to append nodes from the result of [get-nodes] to the [content] node. The [get-nodes] expression retrieves all children nodes of the [body] element within an HTML structure converted to a lambda object by [html2lambda].
