/*
 * 1. `@.vector-model`: This iterator searches for the first node named "vector-model" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts the search from the current node's position in the hierarchy and moves upwards, looking for a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located at different levels in the hierarchy, ensuring that you can retrieve it regardless of its exact position relative to the current node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving configuration or settings stored in a "vector-model" node that might be defined at various levels in a hierarchical structure.
 * - Accessing a shared resource or data structure named "vector-model" that is used across different parts of a Hyperlambda application.
