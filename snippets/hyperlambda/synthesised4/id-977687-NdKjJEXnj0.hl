// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to set the value of a node named [.user-name] by retrieving the value from another node. The [set-value] slot is used to change the value of [.user-name] to the result of the [get-value] slot, which fetches the user name from the content of an HTTP POST response. The [get-value] slot points to the [user-name] node within the response content, effectively updating [.user-name] with this value.
set-value:x:@.user-name
   get-value:x:@http.post/*/content/*/user-name
