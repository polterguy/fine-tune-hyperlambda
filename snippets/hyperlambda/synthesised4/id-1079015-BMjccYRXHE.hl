/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which is crucial for retrieving input parameters in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of `.arguments`.
 * 
 * 3. `base-url` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `base-url`. It is used to specifically access the `base-url` argument, which might represent a base URL for constructing API requests or accessing external resources.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Constructing a full API endpoint URL by combining the `base-url` with additional path segments.
 * - Accessing configuration settings related to network requests in a dynamic slot or HTTP endpoint.
