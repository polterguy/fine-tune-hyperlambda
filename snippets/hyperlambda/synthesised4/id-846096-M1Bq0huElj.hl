// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a block of code when all preceding conditional checks have failed. Within this block, it uses [set-value] to modify the value of the [.result] node. The [strings.replace] slot is then employed to replace occurrences of a specified string (indicated by [[references]]) within the [.result] node with the string "false". This approach ensures that if no prior conditions are met, the [.result] node's value is updated accordingly.

   set-value:x:@.result
      strings.replace:x:@.result
