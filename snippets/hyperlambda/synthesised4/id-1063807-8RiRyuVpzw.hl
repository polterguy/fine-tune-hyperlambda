/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by its name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. The ".dp" node is often used in loops or iterations to refer to the current node being processed.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator retrieves the value of the node obtained from the previous iterator as a node by reference. It assumes that the value of the node is another node itself, allowing you to work with the original node directly rather than a copy. This is useful when you need to modify or access the node's value as a node object, especially in scenarios where the node's value is a complex structure or another node.
