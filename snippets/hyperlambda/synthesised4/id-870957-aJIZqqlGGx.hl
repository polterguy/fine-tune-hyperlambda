// The code snippet demonstrates how to save a file using a stream in Hyperlambda. It uses the [io.stream.save-file] slot to save the content from a stream to a specified file path. The [get-value] slot retrieves the stream from the [.arguments] node, specifically from the [file] node's [stream] child, and passes it to [io.stream.save-file] to perform the save operation.
io.stream.save-file:x:@.full-path
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/file/*/stream
