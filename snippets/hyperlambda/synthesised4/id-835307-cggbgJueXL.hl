/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [case] slot with a [bigint] type.
 * // The [case] slot is typically used in conjunction with [switch] to evaluate different conditions.
 * // In this example, the [case] slot is used to handle a specific condition where the value is a [bigint].
 * // 1. [case] - This slot is used to define a condition that will be evaluated within a [switch] statement.
 * // 2. [bigint] - This specifies the type of the value being evaluated in the [case] condition.
