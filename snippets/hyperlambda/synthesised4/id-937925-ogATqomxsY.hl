// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [math.divide] slot to divide the value of a node referenced by [get-value:x:@.dividend] by the value of a node referenced by [get-value:x:@.divisor], and then further divides the result by 2. The [math.divide] slot performs division operations on multiple arguments, with the first argument serving as the base value to be divided by subsequent arguments.
