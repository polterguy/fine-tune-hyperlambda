// The code snippet uses the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate a list of strings into a single string. It retrieves the value of the node pointed to by the expression [@.dp/#/*/path] and concatenates it with the static string "/". This is useful for constructing file paths or URLs by combining multiple path segments into a single string.
strings.concat
   .:/
   get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/path
