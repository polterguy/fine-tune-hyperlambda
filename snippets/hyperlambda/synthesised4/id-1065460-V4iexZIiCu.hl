// 1. `@.fields`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "fields" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name. If "fields" is a direct child of the current node, it will be selected. This is useful when you want to access a specific node by name within the current hierarchy.
