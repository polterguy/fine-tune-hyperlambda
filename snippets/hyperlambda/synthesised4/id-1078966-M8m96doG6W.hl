/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to locate the [.arguments] node, which is typically used to define the arguments for a function or endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument defined within the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `url` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "url". It is used to specifically target the "url" argument within the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract the value of a "url" argument from a list of arguments within a Hyperlambda function or HTTP endpoint. It is useful in scenarios where you need to perform operations based on the URL provided as an argument, such as making HTTP requests or validating the URL format.
