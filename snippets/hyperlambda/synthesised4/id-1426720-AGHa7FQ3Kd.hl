// The code snippet uses the [and] slot to evaluate a condition. It checks if the value of the [id] node within the current node reference [.dp] is equal to another [id] node. The [and] slot ensures that all conditions provided as its children must evaluate to true for the entire [and] block to be true. In this case, it evaluates a single condition using the [id.eq] slot, which compares the value of the [id] node within the current node reference [.dp] to another [id] node.
