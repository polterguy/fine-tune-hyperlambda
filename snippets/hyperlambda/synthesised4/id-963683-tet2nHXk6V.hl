// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to delete records from a "Customers" table in an SQLite database using the [data.delete] slot. The [database-type] specifies the database as SQLite, while the [table] indicates the target table for deletion. The [where] clause, with its [and] condition, is used to specify the criteria for selecting which records to delete.
