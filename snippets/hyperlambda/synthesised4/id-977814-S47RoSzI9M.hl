// This code uses the [switch] slot to evaluate the result of a [math.add] operation. It checks for specific integer values, 100 and 80, and logs different messages based on the matched case. If neither case is matched, the [default] case logs a motivational message. The [switch] slot allows for conditional branching based on the evaluated value.
switch:x:@math.add
   case:int:100
      log.info:Perfect Score!
   case:int:80
      log.info:Great job!
   default
      log.info:Keep going!
