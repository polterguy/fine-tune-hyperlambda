// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the value of all nodes referenced by the expression [@.arg/*/name] to the value obtained from the node referenced by [@.dp/#/*/name]. The [set-value] slot is used to perform this operation, where the destination expression can modify multiple nodes, but the source expression must return a single result.
set-value:x:@.arg/*/name
