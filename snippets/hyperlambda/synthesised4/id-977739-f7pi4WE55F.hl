// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] slot to evaluate multiple conditions. The [and] slot will only return true if all its child conditions evaluate to true. Here, it checks if the value of the node referenced by the expression [id.eq:x:@.arguments/*/animal-id] is true, and if there are other conditions, they must also be true for the [and] slot to evaluate to true. This is useful for combining multiple logical conditions into a single evaluation.
