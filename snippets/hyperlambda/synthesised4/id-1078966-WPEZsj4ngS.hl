/*
 * 1. `@.model`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "model" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. It is used to navigate the node structure and find a specific node by its name. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to access a configuration or data model node within a larger Hyperlambda structure, allowing subsequent operations to be performed on or with the data contained in the "model" node.
