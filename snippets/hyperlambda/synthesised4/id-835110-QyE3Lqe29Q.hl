// The code snippet demonstrates how to execute SQL commands stored in a file using MySQL in Hyperlambda. It connects to a MySQL database using [mysql.connect] and executes the SQL commands from a file loaded by [io.file.load] using [mysql.execute]. This approach allows for executing pre-written SQL scripts directly from a file.
