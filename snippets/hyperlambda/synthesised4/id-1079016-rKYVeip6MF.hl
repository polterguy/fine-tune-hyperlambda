 * 1. `@.only-prompt` - This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which indicates that it is looking for the first node in the hierarchy with the name "only-prompt". The `.` before "only-prompt" suggests that it is looking for this node as a direct child of the current node. This expression is useful when you need to access a specific node named "only-prompt" that is a direct child of the current context. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This could be used in a scenario where you have a configuration or data structure with a node named "only-prompt" and you need to retrieve or manipulate its value or children.
