// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate a list of strings and a value retrieved from a node. It constructs a SQL query string to retrieve table information by combining static strings with a dynamic table name. The [get-value] slot is used to fetch the table name from the [.arguments] node, which is then concatenated with the other strings to form the complete query.
