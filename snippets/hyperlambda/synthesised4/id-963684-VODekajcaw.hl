// The code demonstrates the use of the [fork] slot to execute a sequence of logging and sleep operations in a separate thread. It logs a message indicating the start of "Logging task 1", pauses execution for 500 milliseconds, and then logs a completion message, all without blocking the main thread.
fork
   log.info:Logging task 1 started
   sleep:500
   log.info:Logging task 1 completed
