// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, the [unwrap] slot evaluates the expression, resulting in the [.dest] node having the value "Hello World" before it is reached. This slot is useful for forward evaluating expressions in lambda objects.
