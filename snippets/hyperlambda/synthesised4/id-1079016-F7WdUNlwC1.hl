/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node itself, to find the first occurrence of a node named "session". This is useful for accessing session-related data or configurations that are stored in a node named "session". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing user session data in a web application to retrieve user-specific information.
 * - Retrieving configuration settings stored in a "session" node for processing within a Hyperlambda application.
