/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It's used to access the root node of the arguments passed to a function or endpoint.
 *    
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously retrieved "arguments" node. It allows access to each individual argument passed in.
 * 
 * 3. `search_postfix`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "search_postfix" among the children of "arguments". This is useful for extracting a specific argument named "search_postfix" from a list of arguments.
 * 
 * **Use Case**: This expression can be used in a scenario where a function or endpoint needs to retrieve a specific argument named "search_postfix" from its input arguments. This could be part of a search functionality where the "search_postfix" is used to filter or modify search results based on a suffix condition.
