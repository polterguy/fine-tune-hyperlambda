 * // The code retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression [@.domain] and returns it. The [get-value] slot is used to access the value of a node in the current context, allowing for dynamic retrieval of data based on the expression provided. This is useful for accessing specific values within a node structure in Hyperlambda.
 * // 1. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * // 2. [@.domain] - The expression pointing to the node whose value is to be retrieved.
