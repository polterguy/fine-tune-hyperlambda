/*
 * 1. `@html2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named `html2lambda` in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further navigation within the node structure.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `html2lambda` node. It is used to access the next level of nodes within the `html2lambda` structure.
 * 3. `html` - This iterator filters the children nodes to find those named `html`. It is used to specifically target nodes that represent HTML content.
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `html` node. It is used to access the next level of nodes within the HTML structure.
 * 5. `body` - This iterator filters the children nodes to find those named `body`. It is used to specifically target the body section of the HTML content.
 * 6. `**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the `body` node, including the node itself. It is used to perform a breadth-first search through the entire body content.
 * 7. `a` - This iterator filters the descendant nodes to find those named `a`. It is used to specifically target anchor (`<a>`) elements within the body content.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting all anchor (`<a>`) elements from the body of an HTML document for further processing, such as collecting hyperlinks.
 * - Analyzing or modifying specific parts of an HTML document by focusing on anchor elements within the body section.
