/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "sql" that is a sibling of the current node. It starts the search from the current node and looks for a node named "sql" at the same hierarchical level. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression might be used to locate and execute SQL queries or statements stored in a node named "sql" within a Hyperlambda script.
 * - It could be used to dynamically modify or evaluate SQL-related data or configurations stored in a sibling node named "sql".
