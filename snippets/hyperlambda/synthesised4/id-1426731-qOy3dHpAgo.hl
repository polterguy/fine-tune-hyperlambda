/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate a static string with the value of a node pointed to by an expression, and another static string. The result is a complete error message string that includes the error message retrieved from the [.arguments/*/message] node. The concatenated string will be in the format: "Something went wrong as we tried to load sitemap, error was; '[error message]'". 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 2. [.] - Static string "Something went wrong as we tried to load sitemap, error was; '"
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node pointed to by the expression [.arguments/*/message].
 * 4. [.] - Static string "'"
