// 1. `@math.max`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "math.max" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it should search for a node by name. This is useful in scenarios where you need to reference a specific node by its name to either retrieve its value or perform operations on it. In this context, it might be used to find a node that performs a mathematical operation, such as finding the maximum value among a set of numbers.
