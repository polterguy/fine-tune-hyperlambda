// This Hyperlambda code performs a string replacement operation on the node referenced by [.result]. It uses [strings.replace] to substitute occurrences of a substring specified by [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/what] with another substring specified by [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/with]. The [get-value] slots retrieve the respective values from the current node context, allowing dynamic string manipulation based on the node's data.
