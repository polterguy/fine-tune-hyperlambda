 * 1. `@lambda2json`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "lambda2json" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to find a node that is responsible for converting a Hyperlambda structure into a JSON format, which might be useful in scenarios where you need to serialize Hyperlambda data for storage, transmission, or logging purposes.
