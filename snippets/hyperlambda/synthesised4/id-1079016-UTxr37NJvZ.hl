/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] from the current context. It is commonly used to access the arguments node in Hyperlambda, especially in the context of HTTP endpoints or dynamic slot executions where arguments are passed.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is useful when you want to access or iterate over all the arguments provided to a slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `/data` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name [data]. It is used to specifically target a node named [data] among the children of [.arguments].
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or endpoint to access a specific argument named [data] that is passed to it. It is useful in scenarios where you need to perform operations or validations on the [data] argument within your logic.
 * - It could also be used in a logging or debugging context to extract and log the [data] argument for analysis or troubleshooting purposes.
