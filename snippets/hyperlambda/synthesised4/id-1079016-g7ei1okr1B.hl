/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator searches for the first node with the specified name in the current context. In this case, it looks for the first node named "result". It starts from the current node and searches upwards through its ancestors and siblings until it finds a match. This is useful when you need to retrieve a specific node by name within a complex node structure.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the result of a computation or operation stored in a node named "result".
 * - Accessing a specific node that holds the outcome of a process, such as a calculation or a decision, within a larger Hyperlambda graph.
