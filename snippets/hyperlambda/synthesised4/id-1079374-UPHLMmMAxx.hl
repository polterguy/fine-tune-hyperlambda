/*
 * 1. `@.fields`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "fields" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It does not traverse sibling nodes but looks for the node in the current node's ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is a parent or ancestor of the current node, particularly when dealing with structured data where certain nodes are expected to be present in a higher level of the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access configuration or metadata stored in a "fields" node that is defined at a higher level in the hierarchy, such as when processing form data or handling structured input where the "fields" node contains important definitions or settings.
