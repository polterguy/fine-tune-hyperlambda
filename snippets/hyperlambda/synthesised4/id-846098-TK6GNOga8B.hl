/*
 * The code sets the value of the [.greeting] node to the first non-null value obtained from either the [get-value] invocation pointing to a node within [data.read] or a default string "Hello there! How may I help you today?". This ensures that [.greeting] has a meaningful value, using a default if necessary. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.greeting] node.
 * 2. [get-first-value] - Retrieves the first non-null value from its children.
 * 3. [get-value] - Attempts to get a value from the specified path in [data.read].
 * 4. [.] - Provides a default greeting string if no other value is found.
