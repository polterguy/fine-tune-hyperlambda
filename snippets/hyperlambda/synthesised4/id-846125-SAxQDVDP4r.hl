/*
 * The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes from one node set to another. Specifically, it retrieves all child nodes from the [.session] node using [get-nodes] and appends them to the [.cache-session] node using [add]. This operation effectively copies the children of [.session] into [.cache-session]. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified destination node.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves all child nodes of the [.session] node.
