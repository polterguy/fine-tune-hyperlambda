/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that it starts the search from the current node's position in the hierarchy. This is useful for retrieving a specific node that contains SQL-related information or commands, which can then be used for further processing or execution within the Hyperlambda script.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to dynamically retrieve and execute SQL commands stored in a node named "sql" within a Hyperlambda script. This allows for flexible database operations based on the current context or input parameters.
