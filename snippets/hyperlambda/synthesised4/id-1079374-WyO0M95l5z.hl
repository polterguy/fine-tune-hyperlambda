/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name from the current context. In this case, it looks for the first node named "fields". It does not traverse siblings, only direct children of the current node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a specific node named "fields" to retrieve its value or manipulate it further.
 * - Useful in scenarios where you need to extract or modify data associated with a "fields" node in a structured data set.
