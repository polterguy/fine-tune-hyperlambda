// This code calculates the difference between two time values, [end] and [begin], and assigns the result to the [time] node. It uses [math.subtract] to perform the subtraction operation, and [set-value] to update the [time] node with the calculated duration. The [get-value] slots retrieve the values of [end] and [begin] for the subtraction.
