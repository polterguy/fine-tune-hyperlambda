// This Hyperlambda code snippet evaluates whether the value of the node [value] is greater than 10 using the [mt] slot. If the condition is true, it sets the value of the [result] node to "Value is greater than 10" using the [set-value] slot. The [if] slot is used to conditionally execute the [set-value] operation based on the comparison result.
