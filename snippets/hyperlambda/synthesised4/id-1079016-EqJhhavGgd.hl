/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors or the node itself if it matches. This is useful for accessing session-related data or configurations that are stored in a node named "session" within the current context or its ancestors.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing session variables or data in a web application to maintain user state.
 * - Retrieving configuration settings stored in a "session" node for use in subsequent operations.
