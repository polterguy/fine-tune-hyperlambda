// 1. `@.create-database-script`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "create-database-script" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it should look for a node with this specific name, and the `.` implies that it starts the search from the current node's context. This type of iterator is useful when you need to access a specific node by name, especially when you are working with a structured data set and need to retrieve or manipulate data associated with a particular node.
