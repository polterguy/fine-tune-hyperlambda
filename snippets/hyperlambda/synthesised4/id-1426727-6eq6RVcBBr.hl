/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [mt] slot to compare two values. It checks if the value of the [total] node, which is a child of the [signal] node, is greater than the value obtained from the [get-count] slot. If the value of [total] is more than the value returned by [get-count], the [mt] slot will return true. 
 * 
 * 1. [mt] - Compares two values and returns true if the first value is greater than the second.
 * 2. [get-value:x:@signal/*/total] - Retrieves the value of the [total] node, which is a child of the [signal] node.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@get-count] - Retrieves the value from the [get-count] slot.
