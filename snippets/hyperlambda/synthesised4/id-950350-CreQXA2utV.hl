// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform an SQL join operation between two tables, 'city' and 'country', using an inner join on the 'country_id' column. It specifies the columns to be retrieved from each table, namely 'city.city' and 'country.country', and limits the result set to 5 records. The [data.read] slot is used to construct and execute the SQL query, with [join] defining the relationship between the tables and [columns] specifying the desired output columns.
data.read
   table:city
   join
      inner
         table:country
         on
            city.country_id
            country.country_id
   columns
      city.city
      country.country
   limit:5
