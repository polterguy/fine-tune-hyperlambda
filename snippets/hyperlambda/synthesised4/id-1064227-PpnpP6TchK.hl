/*
 * 1. `@data.read` - This iterator starts by finding the first node with the name "data.read". It looks for this node in the current context, starting from the root and moving downwards, but not traversing siblings.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.read" node. It allows access to any direct descendants of the "data.read" node.
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of each node obtained from the previous step. It effectively allows access to the grandchildren of the "data.read" node, providing a way to traverse two levels down from "data.read". 
 * 
 * This expression is useful for accessing deeply nested data within a specific node, allowing operations on or retrieval of data from the grandchildren of the "data.read" node.
