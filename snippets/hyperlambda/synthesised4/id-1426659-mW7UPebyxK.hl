/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a logical condition using the [and] slot, which combines two conditions. The first condition checks if the node referenced by [.dp/#] is not null using [not-null], and the second condition checks if the same node's value is not equal to an empty value using [neq]. If both conditions are true, the [and] slot evaluates to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Combines multiple conditions and evaluates to true only if all conditions are true.
 * 2. [not-null:x:@.dp/#] - Checks if the node referenced by [.dp/#] is not null.
 * 3. [neq:x:@.dp/#] - Checks if the node's value is not equal to an empty value.
 * 4. [.] - Represents an empty value for comparison in the [neq] slot.
