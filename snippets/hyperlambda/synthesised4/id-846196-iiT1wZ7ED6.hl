/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes to a specified destination node. It adds a node structure with a [role] and [content] node into the [.session] node. The [content] node's value is dynamically retrieved using an expression that points to the value of a node referenced by [.dp]. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the [.session] node.
 * 2. [.] - Creates a new node as a child of [.session].
 * 3. [.] - Creates a nested node structure.
 * 4. [role] - Sets the role to "assistant".
 * 5. [content] - Retrieves and sets the content from the [.dp] node's prompt.
