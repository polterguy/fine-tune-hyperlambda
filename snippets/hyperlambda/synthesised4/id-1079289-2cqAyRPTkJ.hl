/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "dp" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is used to locate a specific node named "dp" that is an ancestor or sibling of the current context. This is useful when you want to access a node that is not directly a child of the current node but exists somewhere above it in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator retrieves the value of the node found by the previous iterator as a node by reference. It assumes that the value of the "dp" node is itself a node, allowing modifications to the original node rather than just a copy. This is particularly useful when you want to perform operations on the actual node value, such as updating or processing it further.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a loop or a function where you need to access and modify the value of a "dp" node that is not directly a child of the current node but exists higher up in the hierarchy. For example, it could be used in a [for-each] loop to iterate over a collection of nodes and perform operations on each node's "dp" value.
