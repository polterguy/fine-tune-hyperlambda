// 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before it in its hierarchy that matches the given name. In this case, it looks for a node named "fields" in the current context. It is useful for accessing specific nodes by name within the current scope or hierarchy, allowing you to work with or manipulate the data contained in that node.
