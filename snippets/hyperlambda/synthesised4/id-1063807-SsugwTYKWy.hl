// 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before it in its hierarchy that matches the given name. In this case, it looks for the first ancestor node named "database-type". This is useful when you want to access a specific node that is not a direct child or sibling but exists somewhere up in the hierarchy, allowing you to reference configuration or metadata nodes that might be defined at a higher level in the structure.
