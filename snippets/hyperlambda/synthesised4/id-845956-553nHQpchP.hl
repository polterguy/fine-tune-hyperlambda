// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [eq] slot to check for equality between two values. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [.request-id] node, and the [eq] slot compares this value with another value specified as a child node. If both values are exactly the same, the [eq] slot evaluates to true.
