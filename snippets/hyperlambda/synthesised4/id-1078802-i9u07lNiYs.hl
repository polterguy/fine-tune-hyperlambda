/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to navigate to the top of the node hierarchy from the current position. This is useful when you want to start your search or operation from the very beginning of the node tree.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children nodes of the root node. This is useful for iterating over or accessing all direct descendants of the root node.
 * 
 * 3. `.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the node named `.arguments` from the previous result set, which in this case is the children of the root node. The `.arguments` node is often used to define input parameters or arguments for a function or operation.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. This is useful for accessing or processing each argument defined within the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 5. `test_file` - This iterator retrieves the node named `test_file` from the previous result set, which are the children of the `.arguments` node. This is useful for accessing a specific argument or parameter named `test_file`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access a specific argument named `test_file` from a set of input parameters defined at the root level of a Hyperlambda script. This might be relevant in a context where the script processes files or requires a file path as input.
