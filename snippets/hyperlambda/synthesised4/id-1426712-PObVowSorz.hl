/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is an [else] block that concatenates a success message into the [.new-prompt] node. It appends the string "Invocation of '" followed by the value of the [workflow] node within the [execute] node, and then appends "' was a success." along with two newline characters. The [else] block is executed if preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are not met. 
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes the block if previous conditions are false.
 * 2. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.new-prompt] node.
 * 3. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings.
 * 4. [get-value:x:@.new-prompt] - Retrieves the current value of [.new-prompt].
 * 5. [.:Invocation of '] - Static string to be concatenated.
 * 6. [get-value:x:@execute/*/workflow] - Retrieves the value of the [workflow] node.
 * 7. [.: was a success.] - Static string to be concatenated.
 * 8. [.:@"] - Appends a newline character.
 * 9. [.:@"] - Appends another newline character.
