// 1. `@.type`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "type" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it will traverse upwards in the hierarchy to find the node. This is useful when you need to access a specific configuration or metadata node that might be defined at a higher level in the hierarchy, such as retrieving a type declaration or a configuration setting that applies to the current context.
