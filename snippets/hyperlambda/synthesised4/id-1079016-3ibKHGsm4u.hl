/*
 * 1. `@.invoke` - This iterator searches for the first ancestor node named "invoke" from the current node's context. It is useful when you need to access or manipulate data related to a specific invocation or operation that is encapsulated within an "invoke" node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "invoke" node. It is commonly used when you need to process or evaluate all elements within a specific context or operation.
 * 
 * 3. `.result` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "result" from the children of the "invoke" node. It is often used to extract or manipulate the outcome or output of a particular invocation or operation.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing the result of a specific invocation to perform further processing or validation.
 * - Logging or auditing the outcome of an operation encapsulated within an "invoke" node.
