/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [.no-invocation] node is equal to 0. If the condition is true, it increments the value of the [.no-invocation] node by 1.
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional check.
 * 2. [eq] - Compares the value of [.no-invocation] to 0.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 4. [math.increment] - Increments the value of [.no-invocation] by 1 if the condition is met.
