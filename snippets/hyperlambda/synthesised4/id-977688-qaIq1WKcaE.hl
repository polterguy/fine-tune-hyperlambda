// The [if] slot in Hyperlambda allows conditional execution of code based on a boolean condition. It requires two arguments: a condition that evaluates to true or false, and a [.lambda] block that executes if the condition is true. The [.lambda] block contains the code to be executed when the condition is met. The [if] slot can also directly point to an expression that evaluates to a boolean, simplifying the syntax by eliminating the need for an explicit [.lambda] node.
