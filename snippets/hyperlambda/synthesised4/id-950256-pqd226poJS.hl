// The code demonstrates the use of the [join] slot to synchronize multiple asynchronous operations. It utilizes several [fork] slots to read different log files concurrently, and the [join] slot ensures that the execution waits for all [fork] operations to complete before proceeding. This pattern is useful for parallel processing of tasks and aggregating results.
