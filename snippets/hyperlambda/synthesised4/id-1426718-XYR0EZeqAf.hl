/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is part of a switch-case structure, specifically handling the "cs" case. It sets the value of a node named [.handle] to true, indicating a boolean state change. Additionally, it modifies a node named [.file-meta] by concatenating its current value with the string "File type: VB.NET". This suggests that the code is likely used to handle file metadata, specifically marking files of a certain type and updating their metadata description. 
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Represents a condition in a switch-case structure, specifically for the "cs" case.
 * 2. [set-value] - Changes the value of the specified node.
 * 3. [strings.concat] - Concatenates strings to modify the [.file-meta] node.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the current value of the [.file-meta] node.
 * 5. [.] - Represents a static string value to be concatenated.
