/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to access a specific node in a complex structure without knowing its exact position.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the previously found node. In this context, it will return all child nodes of the "hyper2lambda" node. This is helpful when you need to process or evaluate all elements within a particular section of your data structure.
 * 
 * 3. `verb` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "verb" from the previously retrieved children. It effectively narrows down the selection to nodes of interest, allowing for targeted operations or evaluations. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to extract or manipulate specific types of data within a broader dataset.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting all "verb" nodes from a specific section of a Hyperlambda document for processing or analysis.
 * - Implementing a feature that requires identifying and working with specific types of nodes, such as verbs in a language processing application.
