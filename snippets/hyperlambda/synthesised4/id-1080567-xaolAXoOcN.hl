/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `.sql` within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it should look within the current scope or context. This is useful when you want to retrieve a specific node that is expected to exist within the current execution context, such as accessing a SQL query or command that has been defined elsewhere in the Hyperlambda code.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a predefined SQL query or command stored in a node named `.sql`, and you need to retrieve and possibly execute this query within your Hyperlambda application.
