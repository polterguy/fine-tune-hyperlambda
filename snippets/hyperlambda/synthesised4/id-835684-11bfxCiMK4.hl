/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specified location in a Hyperlambda graph. It adds nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot, which references all nodes under [.arguments], to the path specified by the expression in [add]. This operation effectively merges the nodes from [.arguments] into the target location within the graph. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified location in the Hyperlambda graph.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] path to be added.
