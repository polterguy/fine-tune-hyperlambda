// This Hyperlambda code logs a message indicating the successful invocation of a function. It retrieves the type of the argument specified by [type] and the file path of the function using [function-file], and logs this information using [log.info]. The slots used are: [log.info] for logging, [type] to get the type of an argument, and [function-file] to get the file path of the function.
log.info:Function invocation succeeded
   type:x:@.arguments/*/type
   function-file:x:@.file
