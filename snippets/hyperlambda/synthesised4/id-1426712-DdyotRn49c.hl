/*
 * The code snippet adds a new node to the [.session] node. This new node contains another child node with the name [role] and value "system", and a [content] node whose value is derived from the [context] node within the [signal] node. This effectively appends a structured data segment to the [.session] node, which can be used for storing session-related information, such as user roles and context data. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node to the [.session] node.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the new node being added to [.session].
 * 3. [..] - Represents the child node of the newly added node.
 * 4. [role] - Sets the role of the session to "system".
 * 5. [content] - Sets the content value to the value of the [context] node within the [signal] node.
