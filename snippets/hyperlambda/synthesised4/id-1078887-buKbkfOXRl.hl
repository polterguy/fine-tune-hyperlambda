/*
 * 1. `@.result` - This iterator searches for the first node named "result" starting from the current context. It looks for a node with this name in the current node's hierarchy, moving upwards if necessary. This is useful for accessing a specific node that holds a result or outcome of a previous operation.
 * 
 * 2. `/0` - This iterator retrieves the first child of the node found in the previous step. It is used to access the first element within the "result" node, which can be useful when the "result" node contains multiple children and you are only interested in the first one.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing the first result of a computation or operation stored in a node named "result".
 * - Retrieving the first element of a list or collection stored under a "result" node for further processing or evaluation.
