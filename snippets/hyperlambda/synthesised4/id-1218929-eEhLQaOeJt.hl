// Retrieves the value of the first [.dp] node it finds upwards in the hierarchy, assuming the value is another node, and returns this node by reference. This allows for direct manipulation of the original node, rather than a copy. Useful in scenarios where you need to modify the original node's value during iterations or within dynamic slot executions.
