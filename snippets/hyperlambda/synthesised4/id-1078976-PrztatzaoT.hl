/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it will search for the node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for accessing a specific node that is expected to be present in the current execution context, often used in loops or dynamic slot executions where ".dp" might be a placeholder for "data point" or a similar concept.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It treats the value of the ".dp" node as a node itself, allowing you to manipulate or access the node that is stored as the value of ".dp". This is useful when ".dp" contains a reference to another node that you want to work with directly.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node that was de-referenced in the previous step. It is used to access all immediate child nodes of the node that ".dp" points to. This is useful for iterating over or examining all elements contained within a parent node.
 * 
 * 4. `=` - This iterator filters the nodes retrieved by the previous step to only include those whose values match a specified value. In this context, it would be used to find a specific child node of the de-referenced ".dp" node whose value is equal to a given value. This is useful for searching for specific data within a set of nodes, such as finding a configuration setting or a specific data entry.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * - Accessing and manipulating a specific data structure within a loop or a dynamic slot where ".dp" is used to pass around data points.
 * - Filtering a list of child nodes to find one with a specific value, such as searching for a configuration parameter or a specific entry in a dataset.
