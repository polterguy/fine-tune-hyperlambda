/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by finding the first node named [.arguments] in the current execution context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, and the dot before "arguments" implies it's looking for a node named "arguments" at the current level or higher in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. The asterisk (*) is used to access all direct child nodes, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `table`: This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes named "table" among the children of the [.arguments] node. It narrows down the selection to nodes specifically named "table".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access a specific parameter or argument named "table" that is passed into a Hyperlambda function or HTTP endpoint. It is useful in scenarios where you need to manipulate or retrieve data associated with a "table" argument, such as querying a database table or processing data related to a table structure.
