// 1. `@.from` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "from" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node by name, and the `.` before "from" specifies that it should start the search from the current node's context. This expression is useful when you need to retrieve a specific node named "from" that is directly related to the current node, such as when processing email headers or message metadata where "from" indicates the sender's information.
