/*
 * The Hyperlambda code snippet retrieves the value of the [payload] node's children within an [http.post] request and adds it to a node. It uses [add] to sum up the values, and [get-value] to access the children of [payload]. The code effectively processes the payload data within an HTTP POST request. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds the values of the specified nodes.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the children nodes of the [payload] node.
