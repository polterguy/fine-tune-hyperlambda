/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to list tasks using the [tasks.list] slot and create a backup of a SQLite database. The [tasks.list] slot is used to retrieve a list of tasks, optionally handling [offset] and [limit] arguments to enable pagination. The [sqlite.create-backup] slot is used to create a backup of a SQLite database. The code snippet illustrates the combination of these functionalities to manage tasks and ensure data safety through backups. 
 * 
 * 1. [tasks.list] - Lists tasks with optional pagination using [offset] and [limit].
 * 2. [sqlite.create-backup] - Creates a backup of a SQLite database.
