/*
 * 1. `@.lambda` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named "lambda" in the current context. It is used to locate the specific node that serves as the starting point for further traversal.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "lambda" node. It is used to access the immediate descendants of the "lambda" node.
 * 
 * 3. `lambda2hyper` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "lambda2hyper" from the children of the "lambda" node. It is used to narrow down the search to nodes with this specific name.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "lambda2hyper" node. It is used to access the immediate descendants of the "lambda2hyper" node.
 * 
 * 5. `timeshifts` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "timeshifts" from the children of the "lambda2hyper" node. It is used to narrow down the search to nodes with this specific name.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "timeshifts" node. It is used to access the immediate descendants of the "timeshifts" node.
 * 
 * 7. `lead_generated` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "lead_generated" from the children of the "timeshifts" node. It is used to narrow down the search to nodes with this specific name.
 * 
 * 8. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "lead_generated" node. It is used to access the immediate descendants of the "lead_generated" node.
 * 
 * 9. `items` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "items" from the children of the "lead_generated" node. It is used to narrow down the search to nodes with this specific name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract specific data related to "items" that are generated as leads within a hierarchical structure. It is useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze lead information stored in a nested node structure.
 * - It can be applied in data processing pipelines where you need to retrieve and manipulate specific nodes within a complex data graph, such as in CRM systems or marketing automation tools.
