// The code snippet retrieves the [result] value from the [execute] node, extracts a substring starting from index 0 with a length determined by converting the product of a [math.multiply] operation to an integer, and then sets this substring as the new value of the [result] node. The [set-value] slot is used to update the [result] node, while [strings.substring] and [convert] are used to manipulate the string and its length.
