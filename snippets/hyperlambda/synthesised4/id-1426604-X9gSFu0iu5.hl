/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement to perform conditional execution based on the value of a node. The [switch] node evaluates the value of a specified node and executes the corresponding [case] node that matches this value. If no [case] matches, a [default] node is executed if present. The example shows how to set a result based on the value of a [val] node, illustrating conditional logic similar to a switch/case construct in traditional programming languages.
 * 
 * 1. [val] - This node holds the value to be evaluated by the [switch] statement.
 * 2. [result] - This node will store the outcome of the [switch] statement.
 * 3. [switch] - Evaluates the value of the [val] node and determines which [case] to execute.
 * 4. [case:bar] - A possible case in the [switch] statement that sets the [result] to "Oops" if [val] is "bar".
 * 5. [case:foo] - Another case in the [switch] statement that sets the [result] to "Success!" if [val] is "foo".
 * 6. [default] - Executed if no [case] matches the value of [val], setting the [result] to "Success!" in this example.
