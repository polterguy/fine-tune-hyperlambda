/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.result] node. It utilizes the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specific string (in this case, the string represented by [[references]]) within the current value of [.result] with the string "false". The code effectively updates the [.result] node by substituting parts of its current value with "false" wherever the specified substring is found.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.result] node.
 * 2. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a specific substring within the [.result] node's value.
 * 3. [[references]] - Represents the substring to be replaced within the [.result] node's value.
 * 4. [.] - The replacement string, which is "false" in this case.
