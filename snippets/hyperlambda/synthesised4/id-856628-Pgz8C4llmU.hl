// The code snippet demonstrates a database connection and execution process based on the type of database specified by [.db-type]. It uses a [switch] statement to determine the database type and executes different connection and execution commands for each case: [mssql], [pgsql], [mysql], and [sqlite]. For each database type, it connects to the database and executes SQL commands, often loading SQL from a file using [io.file.load].
switch:x:@.db-type
   case:mssql
      mssql.connect
         mssql.execute-batch:x:@io.file.load
   case:pgsql
      pgsql.connect:[generic|postgres]
         pgsql.execute:create database magic
      pgsql.connect:[generic|magic]
         pgsql.execute:x:@io.file.load
   case:mysql
      mysql.connect
         mysql.execute:x:@io.file.load
   case:sqlite
      sqlite.connect:[generic|magic]
         sqlite.execute:x:@io.file.load
