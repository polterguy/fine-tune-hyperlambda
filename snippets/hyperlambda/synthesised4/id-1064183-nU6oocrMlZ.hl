/*
 * 1. `@data.connect` - This iterator finds the first node with the name "data.connect" in the current context. It starts the expression by locating this specific node, which is likely a node that establishes a connection to a data source.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.connect" node. It expands the search to include any nodes that are directly under "data.connect", allowing access to subsequent nodes in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find the first node named "data.read". This node likely represents an operation or command to read data from the connected data source.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.read" node. It allows access to any nodes that are directly under "data.read", which could include various data-related operations or configurations.
 * 
 * 5. `columns` - This iterator filters the children nodes to find the first node named "columns". This node probably contains information about the columns of the data being read, such as metadata or actual column data.
 * 
 * 6. `0` - This iterator retrieves the first child node of the "columns" node. It is used to access the first column's data or metadata, assuming that "columns" contains multiple child nodes representing different columns.
