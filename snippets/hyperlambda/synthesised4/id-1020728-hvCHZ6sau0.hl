// The expression `-` is an iterator in Hyperlambda that retrieves the previous sibling of the current node. In the context of a Hyperlambda graph, it allows you to access and manipulate the node that is directly above the current node in the hierarchy. This iterator is useful when you need to reference or modify a node that is positioned before the current node in the sequence, enabling operations that depend on the order of nodes. For instance, you might use it to adjust values or conditions based on preceding nodes in a loop or conditional structure.
