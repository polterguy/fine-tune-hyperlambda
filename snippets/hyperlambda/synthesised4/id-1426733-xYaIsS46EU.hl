/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the [insert_url] argument is provided, and if so, it appends a formatted string to the [completion] node. The appended string includes two new lines followed by a message indicating that the information was taken from a specified URL, which is retrieved from the [url] argument. The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate the existing value of [completion] with the new message. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if the [insert_url] argument is provided.
 * 2. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [completion] node.
 * 3. [strings.concat] - Concatenates strings to form the new value for [completion].
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the current value of [completion].
 * 5. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [url] argument.
