/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of a specific node in a hierarchical structure. It uses the [get-value] slot to access the value of a node that is a descendant of the current [.dp] node. The expression [x:@.dp/#/*/Default] navigates through the node structure to locate the "Default" node, starting from the [.dp] node, dereferencing its value, and then traversing its children to find the "Default" node. This is useful for extracting specific data from a complex node graph.
 * // 1. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression.
 * // 2. [x:@.dp/#/*/Default] - The expression used to locate the "Default" node starting from the [.dp] node, dereferencing its value, and traversing its children.
