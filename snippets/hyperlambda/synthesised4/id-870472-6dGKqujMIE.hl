// This Hyperlambda code snippet renames all occurrences of the [data.connect] slot within the [hyper2lambda] node to [mysql.connect]. The [set-name] slot is used to change the name of nodes, and the lambda expression [x:@hyper2lambda/**/data.connect] targets all [data.connect] nodes within the [hyper2lambda] node, replacing their names with "mysql.connect".
