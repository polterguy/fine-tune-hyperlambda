/*
 * 1. `@data.select` - This iterator starts by locating the first node named `data.select`. It searches from the current context and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you want to pinpoint a specific node by name in a potentially large and complex node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the `data.select` node. It is used when you want to process or examine every child node under a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - The second `*` retrieves all children of each child node obtained from the previous step. This is useful for delving deeper into the hierarchy to access nested structures or data.
 * 
 * 4. `keyword_count` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `keyword_count`. It is used when you need to extract or manipulate data associated with a specific node name within a broader context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * - Extracting the `keyword_count` information from a dataset where `data.select` represents a collection of items, each with various attributes, and `keyword_count` is a specific attribute of interest.
 * - Aggregating or analyzing keyword counts across multiple entries in a data set for reporting or data analysis purposes.
