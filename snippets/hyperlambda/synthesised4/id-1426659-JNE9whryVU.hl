/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [get-first-value] slot to retrieve the first non-null value from its children nodes. It attempts to get the value from an expression pointing to a node with a specific path, and if that value is null, it defaults to a static string "Image ". This is useful for providing a fallback value when the primary source is unavailable or null. 
 * 
 * 1. [get-first-value] - Retrieves the first non-null value from its children nodes.
 * 2. [get-value] - Attempts to retrieve a value from a specific node path.
 * 3. [.] - Provides a static fallback value "Image " if the primary value is null.
