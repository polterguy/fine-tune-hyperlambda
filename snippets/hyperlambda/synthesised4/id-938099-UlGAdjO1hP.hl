/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [switch] slot to evaluate the value of the [.status] node and executes the corresponding [case] block based on its value. If [.status] is "in-stock", it sets the [.message] node to "Car part is in stock". If [.status] is "out-of-stock", it sets the [.message] node to "Car part is out of stock". If [.status] does not match any [case], the [default] block sets the [.message] node to "Unknown status". 
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Evaluates the value of the [.status] node.
 * 2. [case:in-stock] - Executes if [.status] is "in-stock", setting [.message] to "Car part is in stock".
 * 3. [case:out-of-stock] - Executes if [.status] is "out-of-stock", setting [.message] to "Car part is out of stock".
 * 4. [default] - Executes if no [case] matches, setting [.message] to "Unknown status".
 * 5. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.message] node based on the evaluated [case] or [default].
