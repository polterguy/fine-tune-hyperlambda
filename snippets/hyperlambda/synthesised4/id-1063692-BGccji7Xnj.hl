/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the dot before "arguments" specifies that it should be a direct child of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "arguments" node. It acts as a wildcard, fetching every child node under "arguments" without filtering by name.
 * 
 * 3. `username` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "username". It selects nodes named "username" from the previously retrieved set of children under "arguments".
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is typically used to extract the value of a "username" node from a structured data set where "username" is a child of "arguments". It is useful in scenarios where you need to validate or process user input, such as in authentication or user management systems.
