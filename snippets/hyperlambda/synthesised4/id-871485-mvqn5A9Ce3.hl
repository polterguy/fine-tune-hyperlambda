// The code snippet demonstrates how to perform a database read operation using the [data.read] slot in Hyperlambda, specifically targeting a SQLite database. It specifies a table named "Doctors" and selects an aggregate function, aliasing its result as "result". The query includes a [where] clause with an [and] condition, and limits the result set to one record.
