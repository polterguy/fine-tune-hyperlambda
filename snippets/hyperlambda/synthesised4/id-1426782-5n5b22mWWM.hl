/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if there are any image nodes within a specified path and appends a formatted string to a completion node for each image found. It first verifies the existence of images and then concatenates a header string to the completion node. For each image, it appends a Markdown formatted image link to the completion node, using the image's name and source URL.
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if there are any image nodes within the specified path.
 * 2. [exists] - Evaluates to true if the specified path contains one or more image nodes.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the [if] condition is true.
 * 4. [set-value] - Sets the value of the completion node by concatenating strings.
 * 5. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings and values.
 * 6. [get-value] - Retrieves the current value of the completion node.
 * 7. [for-each] - Iterates over each image node found in the specified path.
 * 8. [set-value] - Updates the completion node with a Markdown formatted image link.
 * 9. [get-value] - Retrieves the name and source URL of each image node.
