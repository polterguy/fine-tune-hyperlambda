// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [switch] slot to determine the payment method based on the value of the [payment_method] node. It evaluates each [case] node to find a match and sets the [result] node's value accordingly. If none of the [case] nodes match, the [default] node sets the [result] to "Unknown payment method". This structure allows for flexible handling of various payment methods.
switch:x:@.payment_method
   case:CreditCard

         .:Paid with PayPal
   case:Crypto
      set-value:x:@.result
         .:Paid with Cryptocurrency
   default
