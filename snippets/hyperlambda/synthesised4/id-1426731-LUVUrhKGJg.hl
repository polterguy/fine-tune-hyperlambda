/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type name of a node's value. The example sets a node [.foo] with an integer value of 57, and then uses the [type] slot to determine and return the type of the node above it. The result of the [type] slot invocation will be the type name of the [.foo] node, which is "int". 
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - Returns the type name of the node above it.
