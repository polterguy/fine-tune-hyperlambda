// The code demonstrates how to perform an HTTP DELETE request using a dynamically constructed URL. It utilizes the [http.delete] slot to send the DELETE request, where the URL is generated by concatenating strings using the [strings.concat] slot. This approach allows for flexible URL construction before making the HTTP request.
http.delete:x:@strings.concat
