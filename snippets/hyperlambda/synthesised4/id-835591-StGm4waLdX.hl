// This Hyperlambda code uses the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the value of the [aggregate_function] node within the [.arguments] node is one of a predefined set of valid options. The valid options specified are "min", "max", "sum", "avg", and "count". If the [aggregate_function] node's value is not one of these options, an exception will be thrown. This is useful for validating input against a set of allowed values, ensuring that only expected aggregate functions are used.
