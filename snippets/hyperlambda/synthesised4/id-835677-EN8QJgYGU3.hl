// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of nodes referenced by its expression to a concatenated string. The [set-name] slot targets nodes using the expression [x:+/+/*/*], and the new name is formed by concatenating a static string [@p] with the value of a node referenced by [get-value:x:@.no]. The [strings.concat] slot combines these elements to create the new node name.
