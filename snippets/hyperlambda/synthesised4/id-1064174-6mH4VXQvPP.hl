/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and traversing upwards through its ancestors. It is used to locate the `.arguments` node in the hierarchy, which typically contains the arguments passed to a function or a slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all the children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access all the argument nodes that are direct children of `.arguments`.
 * 
 * 3. `aggregate_column` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `aggregate_column`. It is used to specifically target the node(s) that have the name `aggregate_column` among the children of `.arguments`. 
 * 
 * This expression is useful for accessing a specific argument named `aggregate_column` that is passed to a function or slot, allowing the function to use or manipulate the value of this argument.
