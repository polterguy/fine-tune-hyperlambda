// The code snippet uses the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate expressions within a lambda object. It targets nodes with a specific path, and the [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate these expressions before the lambda object is executed. This is useful when you want to ensure that certain expressions are resolved to their final values ahead of time. The path used in the expression navigates through the node hierarchy to reach the desired nodes for evaluation.
