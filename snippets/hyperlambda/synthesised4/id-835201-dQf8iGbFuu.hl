// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [return-nodes] slot to return a collection of nodes from a dynamically created slot or another context that allows returning nodes. The [return-nodes] slot is used to return nodes as a lambda object, and in this example, it returns a single node with the name [result] and a value of "Success". This is typically used within a dynamic slot or a context that supports returning nodes to provide structured data as output.
