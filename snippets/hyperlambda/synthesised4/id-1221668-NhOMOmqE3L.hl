// Retrieves all [ArtistId] nodes that are children of the value of the first [.dp] node found upwards in the hierarchy. Useful for obtaining the [ArtistId] values from a data structure where [.dp] holds a reference to a node containing multiple children, such as when iterating over a collection of music tracks or albums and needing to access the artist identifiers.
