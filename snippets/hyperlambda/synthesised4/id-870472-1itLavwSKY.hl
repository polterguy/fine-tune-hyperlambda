// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of all nodes within the [hyper2lambda] node that match the pattern [data.delete] to [mysql.delete]. The [set-name] slot is used to rename nodes, and the expression [x:@hyper2lambda/**/data.delete] specifies the nodes to be renamed, while [.:mysql.delete] provides the new name.
