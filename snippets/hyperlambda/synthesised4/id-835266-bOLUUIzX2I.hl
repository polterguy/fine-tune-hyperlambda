// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [math.decrement] slot to decrease the value of the [.no] node by 1. The [math.decrement] slot modifies the value in place, meaning it directly changes the value of the [.no] node without needing to use [set-value]. If a step value is not provided, it defaults to decrementing by 1. In this case, the expression points to the [.no] node, which is the target of the decrement operation.
