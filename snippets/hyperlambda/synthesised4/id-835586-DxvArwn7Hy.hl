// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to update records in a SQLite database table named "Customers" using the [data.update] slot. It specifies the database type as SQLite and identifies the table to update. The [values] node is intended to hold the columns and their new values for the update operation. The [where] clause, utilizing the [and] slot, is used to specify conditions that determine which records should be updated. Without a [where] clause, all records in the table would be updated, which is typically not desired.
