/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "sql" from the current node's context. The "@" symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name. The "." before "sql" implies that it will start the search from the current node's parent or within the current node's immediate context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to access a SQL query or command stored in a node named "sql" within the current context. It might be part of a larger operation where the SQL command needs to be executed or manipulated.
 * - It could be used in a scenario where multiple SQL commands are stored as nodes, and the expression is used to select and execute a specific command based on its name.
