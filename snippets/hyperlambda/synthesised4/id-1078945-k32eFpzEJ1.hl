/*
 * 1. `@.token`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "token" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for accessing a specific node named "token" that might contain important data, such as an authentication token or a unique identifier, within a larger structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving an authentication token stored in a node named "token" for use in API requests.
 * - Accessing a unique session identifier within a user session management system.
