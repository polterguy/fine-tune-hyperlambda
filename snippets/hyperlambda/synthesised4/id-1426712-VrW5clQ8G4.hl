// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot with the expression "x:+" will evaluate the node immediately following it. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions within a lambda object before it is executed, ensuring that the value of the node is resolved beforehand.
