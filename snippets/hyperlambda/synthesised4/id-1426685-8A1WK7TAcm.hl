/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [get-first-value] slot to retrieve the first non-null value from its children nodes. It first attempts to get the value from the [placeholder] node within the [.arguments] node. If this value is null, it defaults to the static string "Ask me anything ...". This pattern is useful for providing default values when certain arguments are not specified. 
 * 
 * 1. [get-first-value] - Retrieves the first non-null value from its children nodes.
 * 2. [get-value] - Attempts to get the value from the [placeholder] node within the [.arguments] node.
 * 3. [.] - Provides a default static string "Ask me anything ..." if the first value is null.
