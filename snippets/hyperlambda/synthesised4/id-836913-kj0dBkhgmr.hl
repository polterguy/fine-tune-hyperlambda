// This Hyperlambda code modifies the value of the [sql] node by concatenating its current value with additional strings to form a SQL query. The [set-value] slot updates the [sql] node, while [strings.concat] combines the current SQL value with the static strings " from ", "users", and " where keyword_count > 0". This effectively appends a SQL FROM clause and a WHERE condition to the existing SQL query stored in the [sql] node.
