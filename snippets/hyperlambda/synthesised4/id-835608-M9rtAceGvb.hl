/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes from a specified source to a target location in the node graph. The [add] slot targets the path "./*/data.read/*/where/*" and appends nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot, which fetches nodes from the [.arguments] node. This effectively merges nodes from the arguments into the specified location within the graph. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified target location in the graph.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node to be added.
