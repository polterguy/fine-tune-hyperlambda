// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append a node with a specific integer value to an existing node. The [add] slot targets the [.result] node and appends a child node with an integer value of 1. This operation effectively adds a new child node to the [.result] node, modifying its structure by including the specified integer value as a child.
