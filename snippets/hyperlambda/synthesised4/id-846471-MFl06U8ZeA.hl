// The [and] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate multiple boolean conditions, returning true only if all conditions are true. It short-circuits, meaning it stops evaluating further conditions once it encounters a false condition. This behavior allows it to be used in complex logical expressions, ensuring efficient execution by avoiding unnecessary evaluations.
