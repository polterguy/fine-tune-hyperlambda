// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database named "appdb" and reads data from the "users" table, limiting the result set to 10 records. The [data.connect] slot establishes the database connection, while [data.read] specifies the table and the number of records to retrieve using the [limit] slot.
data.connect:appdb
   data.read
      table:users
      limit:int:10
