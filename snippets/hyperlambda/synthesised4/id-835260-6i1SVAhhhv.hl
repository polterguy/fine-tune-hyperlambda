// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a message to a specified feedback channel. The [args] node contains two child nodes: [message] which holds the string "Site has robots.txt", and [type] which is set to "info". This setup is typically used to notify subscribers of a specific event or status update through a real-time communication channel.
