// This Hyperlambda code updates records in the "ml_types" table. It sets the "system_message" field to the value obtained from the [execute] slot. The update is conditional, applying only to records where the "type" field matches the value of the [.type] node. The [where] clause ensures that only specific records are updated based on the condition.
