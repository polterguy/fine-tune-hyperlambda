// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [max_request_tokens] node within the [.model] node to the result of a division operation. The division operation is performed using the [math.divide] slot, and its result is retrieved using the [get-value] slot. The [set-value] slot is used to update the [max_request_tokens] node with this result.
