/*
 * The code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement in Hyperlambda. It evaluates the value of [.input] and executes the corresponding [case] block based on the matched value. If no match is found, the [default] block is executed. This structure allows for conditional branching based on the value of [.input].
 * 
 * 1. [.input] - The node whose value is evaluated in the [switch] statement.
 * 2. [switch] - Initiates a switch statement to evaluate [.input].
 * 3. [case] - Defines a block of code to execute if [.input] matches the specified value.
 * 4. [default] - Executes if no [case] value matches [.input].
