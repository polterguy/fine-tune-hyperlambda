// The code uses the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve a subset of nodes from the [.arguments] node. It targets the first 1000 child nodes within the [.arguments] node, effectively allowing for manipulation or inspection of a large collection of arguments in a controlled manner. This is useful for processing a specific range of nodes when dealing with extensive data sets.
