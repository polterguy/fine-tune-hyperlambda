// This Hyperlambda code sends a SignalR message using the [sockets.signal] slot. It targets a method specified by the value of the [.session] node and transmits an argument named [function_waiting] with a boolean value of false. This allows connected clients subscribed to the specified method to receive the message, with the argument indicating that a function is not waiting. The [args] node is used to define the arguments to be sent with the signal.
