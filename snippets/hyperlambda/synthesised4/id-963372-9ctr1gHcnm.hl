// The code uses [io.stream.open-file] to open a file stream, where the file path is dynamically constructed by concatenating strings using [strings.concat]. The [strings.concat] slot is invoked twice to build the file path, and the resulting path is used as an argument to [io.stream.open-file] to open the stream for the specified file.
