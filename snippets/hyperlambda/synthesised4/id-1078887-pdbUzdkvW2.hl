/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by its name.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It allows the expression to access any child node under [.arguments].
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [session]. It will return the first node named [session] that is a child of [.arguments].
 * 
 * This expression is used to locate a specific [session] node within the [.arguments] node. A potential use case for this expression could be in a web application where session data is passed as part of the arguments to a Hyperlambda endpoint, and the expression is used to retrieve the session information for further processing or validation.
