// The code snippet uses the [and] slot to evaluate multiple conditions. It checks if the type of a node, retrieved using [type], is equal to a specified value using [eq]. The [and] slot ensures that all conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. [type.eq] is a custom slot that likely checks for type equality.
