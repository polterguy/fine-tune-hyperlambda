/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by finding the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It's used to locate the [.arguments] node, which is typically the starting point for accessing arguments passed into a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of [.arguments].
 * 
 * 3. `clear_button` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "clear_button". It is used to specifically find the node representing the "clear_button" argument, if it exists.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to check if a "clear_button" argument has been provided and to access its value or further manipulate it.
 * - It might be used in a UI-related function where the presence or value of a "clear_button" argument determines whether a clear button should be displayed or enabled.
