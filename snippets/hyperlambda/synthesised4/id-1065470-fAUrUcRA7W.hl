// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "sql" that is a sibling or a child of the current node's parent. It is used to access a specific node within the current context, often to retrieve or manipulate its value or children. This is useful in scenarios where you need to interact with a node that contains SQL-related data or commands, allowing you to perform operations like executing a query or modifying SQL parameters.
