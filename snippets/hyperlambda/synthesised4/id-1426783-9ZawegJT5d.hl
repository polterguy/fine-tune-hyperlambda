// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied with the expression "x:+/*/*", which means it will evaluate the expression to retrieve nodes two levels down from the current node's elder sibling, and replace the current node's value with the result of this evaluation. This allows for forward evaluation of expressions, making it useful when you need to manipulate or access node values dynamically before the actual execution of the node.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
