// This Hyperlambda code checks multiple conditions using logical operations. It verifies if the name of a node is "a", checks for the existence of a specific node with an "href" attribute, and ensures that this node is not null. The [and] slot ensures all these conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. The [eq] slot checks for equality, [exists] checks for the presence of nodes, and [not-null] ensures the node has a value.
