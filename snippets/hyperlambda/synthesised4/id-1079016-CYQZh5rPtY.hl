/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "result" from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for accessing a specific node when you know its name and need to retrieve its value or perform operations on it.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Accessing the result of a computation or operation that has been stored in a node named "result".
 * - Checking the value of a "result" node to determine the outcome of a previous operation or decision-making process.
