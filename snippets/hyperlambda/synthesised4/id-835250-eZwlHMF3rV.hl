// The [unwrap] slot in this Hyperlambda code is used to evaluate the expression specified as its value before the node where it's referenced is reached. The expression "x:+/*/*/*" dynamically traverses the node hierarchy, evaluating all nodes at the specified path. This allows for forward evaluation of expressions, ensuring that the values are computed and ready for use in subsequent operations.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*
