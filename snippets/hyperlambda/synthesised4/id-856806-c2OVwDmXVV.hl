// The code snippet demonstrates how to append a newline character to the existing value of a node named [.sql] using the [set-value] and [strings.concat] slots. The [get-value] slot retrieves the current value of [.sql], and [strings.concat] combines it with a newline character, effectively updating [.sql] to include the additional newline.
set-value:x:@.sql
   strings.concat
      get-value:x:@.sql
