 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [arguments] from the current context. It is used to access the node that typically contains arguments or parameters for a function or slot execution.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [arguments] node. It is useful for accessing any parameters or data that might be nested within the [arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [session] from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically access the [session] node, which might contain session-related data or information.
