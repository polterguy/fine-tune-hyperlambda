// 1. `@strings.concat`: This iterator is used to find the first node in the current context with the name "strings.concat". It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a match. This is useful when you need to locate a specific node that performs string concatenation operations, and you want to ensure you're referencing the correct instance of this node in your Hyperlambda code.
