// This Hyperlambda code checks if the status code returned from an HTTP POST request is equal to 429. The [eq] slot is used to compare the value of the [http.post] node, which is expected to be an integer, with the static integer value 429. If the values are equal, the [eq] slot will evaluate to true.
eq:x:@http.post
