/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for the first occurrence of a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the "dp" node is another node itself, allowing you to work with the node by reference rather than a copy. This is useful for modifying the original node directly.
