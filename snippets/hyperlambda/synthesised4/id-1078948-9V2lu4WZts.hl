/*
 * 1. `@invoke` - This iterator searches for the first node named "invoke" within the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to reference a specific node that might not be a direct child of the current node but exists somewhere in the hierarchy above.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "invoke" node found by the previous iterator. It allows you to access or manipulate all the children of the "invoke" node, which can be useful if you need to perform operations on multiple nodes or gather information from them.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - You might use this expression to gather all parameters or settings defined under an "invoke" node, which could represent a function call or operation within your Hyperlambda code.
 * - It could be used in a logging or debugging context to output all arguments or configurations associated with a specific invocation in a dynamic system.
