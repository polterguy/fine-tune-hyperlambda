// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [nullable] exists within [.arguments] and if its value is false. If both conditions are true, it appends the string " not null" to the value of the [sql] node. The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, [and] ensures both conditions are met, [exists] checks for the presence of the [nullable] node, and [eq] compares its value. [set-value] and [strings.concat] are used to modify the [sql] node.
