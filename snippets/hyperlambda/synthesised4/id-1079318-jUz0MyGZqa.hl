/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current result set. It is useful when you need to navigate upwards in the node hierarchy to access parent nodes or to backtrack from a nested structure to its parent context.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is commonly used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing you to iterate over or manipulate multiple child nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the previous result set to include only nodes with the name "data.read". It is used to specifically target nodes with this exact name, which is useful when you need to perform operations on nodes that have a specific role or function identified by their name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression:
 * - Accessing and processing all "data.read" nodes that are children of the parent node of the current context. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to read or process data from multiple sources or nodes that are organized under a common parent.
 * - Navigating a data structure to extract or manipulate specific "data.read" nodes, perhaps in the context of a data processing or transformation task.
