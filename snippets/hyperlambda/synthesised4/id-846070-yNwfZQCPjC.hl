// This Hyperlambda code logs an error message indicating a problem occurred while attempting to crawl a URL for Machine Learning data. It retrieves the URL from the [.arguments] node and converts the current lambda object to a Hyperlambda string using [lambda2hyper], which is then included in the error log. The slots used are [log.error] for logging the error, [url] to specify the URL, and [error] to capture the error details.
log.error:Something went wrong while trying to crawl URL for Machine Learning data
   url:x:@.arguments/*/url
   error:x:@lambda2hyper
