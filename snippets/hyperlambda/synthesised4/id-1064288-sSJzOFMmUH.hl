/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "arguments" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it should search for a node by name, and the dot before "arguments" implies that it is looking for a node at the current level or above in the hierarchy.
 *    
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "arguments" node. The asterisk symbol is used to gather all direct child nodes, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `aggregate_function` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find the one specifically named "aggregate_function". It narrows down the result set to only include nodes with this exact name.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access a specific configuration or parameter named "aggregate_function" within a set of arguments passed to a function or endpoint.
 * - It is useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically select and operate on a particular child node within a larger set of input data, such as when processing different types of aggregation functions in a data processing pipeline.
