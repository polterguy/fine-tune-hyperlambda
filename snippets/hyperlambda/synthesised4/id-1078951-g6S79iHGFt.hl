/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.dp` starting from the current node. It looks for a node with the exact name `.dp` among the siblings and ancestors of the current node. This is often used to access a specific node that is expected to be present in the current context, such as a data pointer or a specific data node.
 * 
 * 2. `@.dp` - This second `@.dp` iterator again searches for the first node named `.dp` starting from the result of the previous iterator. It effectively repeats the search for a `.dp` node, but this time starting from the `.dp` node found by the first iterator. This might be used in cases where there are nested `.dp` nodes, and you need to access a `.dp` node that is a sibling or ancestor of the first `.dp` node found.
 * 
 * 3. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterators. It assumes that the value of the node is itself a reference to another node, allowing you to access or modify the original node rather than a copy. This is useful when you need to work directly with the node's value as a node, such as when you want to change its properties or pass it by reference to another operation.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include scenarios where you have a nested structure of `.dp` nodes, and you need to access a specific `.dp` node's value directly to perform operations like updating, evaluating, or passing it to another function or slot.
