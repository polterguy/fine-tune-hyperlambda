/*
 * The code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to update the value of the [.pk] node. It concatenates the current value of [.pk] with the value of the [name] node, which is a child of the node referenced by [.dp], and appends a comma. The [strings.concat] slot is used to perform the concatenation operation.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the [.pk] node with the result of the [strings.concat] operation.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one, including the current value of [.pk], the value of the [name] node, and a comma.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.pk] - Retrieves the current value of the [.pk] node.
 * 4. [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/name] - Retrieves the value of the [name] node, which is a child of the node referenced by [.dp].
 * 5. [.:,] - Represents a static string value, which is a comma in this case.
