/*
 * The code demonstrates the use of the [whitelist] slot to restrict the execution of only certain slots within a specified scope. It defines a vocabulary allowing only [set-value] and [return] slots to be executed within the [.lambda] block. Inside this block, [set-value] is used to change the value of [.result] to "foo", and [return] is used to return a "success" result. The [.add] slot is commented out to illustrate that it is not part of the allowed vocabulary and would throw an exception if attempted. 
 * 
 * 1. [whitelist] - Restricts the execution of slots within a specified scope.
 * 2. [vocabulary] - Lists the slots allowed to be executed within the [.lambda] block.
 * 3. [set-value] - Changes the value of [.result] to "foo".
 * 4. [.lambda] - The block where only whitelisted slots can be executed.
 * 5. [.add] - Demonstrates an unauthorized slot that would throw an exception if executed.
 * 6. [return] - Returns a "success" result.
