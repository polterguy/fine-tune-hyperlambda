// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the node referenced by the expression "@.value" to the value obtained from the [get-value] slot. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression "@.dp/#", which is typically used within a loop or iteration to access the current node being processed. This pattern is often employed to update a specific node's value based on dynamic or iterated data.
