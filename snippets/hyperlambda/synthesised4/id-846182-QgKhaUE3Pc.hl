// The code uses the [strings.replace] slot to remove occurrences of the substring " without time zone" from the value of the [strings.replace] node. It replaces this substring with an empty string, effectively deleting it. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the substring to be replaced, and the second is the replacement string. In this case, the replacement string is empty, so the specified substring is removed from the original string.
