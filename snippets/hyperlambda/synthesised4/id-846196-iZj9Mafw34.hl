// The [not-null] slot checks if the specified node, in this case [supervised] within [.arguments], has a non-null value. If the node exists and contains a value, the condition evaluates to true; otherwise, it evaluates to false. This is useful for ensuring that a required argument or data point is present and has been assigned a value before proceeding with further logic.
