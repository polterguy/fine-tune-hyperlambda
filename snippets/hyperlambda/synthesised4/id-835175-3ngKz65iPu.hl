// Inserts the result of listing files recursively at the beginning of the [result] node's children, using a dynamically constructed path from concatenated strings. The [insert-before] slot ensures the new nodes are added before the first child of [result]. The [io.file.list-recursively] slot lists all files in a directory and its subdirectories, while [strings.concat] constructs the directory path.
