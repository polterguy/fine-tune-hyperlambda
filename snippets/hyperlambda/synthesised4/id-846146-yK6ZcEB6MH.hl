// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [not] slot to negate the result of an [eq] slot, which checks for equality between two values. The [eq] slot compares the value of the [prompt] node within the [data.read] node against the value of the [prompt] node within the [.dp] node. If these values are not equal, the [not] slot returns true. The code is useful for determining if two prompt values are different.
