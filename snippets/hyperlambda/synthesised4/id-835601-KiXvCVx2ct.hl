// This Hyperlambda code uses the [set-name] slot to change the names of nodes referenced by its expression. It concatenates the values of [aggregate_function] and [aggregate_column] from the [.arguments] node, wrapping the column in parentheses, and assigns this concatenated string as the new name for nodes located at the specified path. The [strings.concat] slot is used to perform the string concatenation.
