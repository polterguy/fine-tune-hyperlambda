/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specific location in the node graph. It retrieves nodes using [get-nodes] from a path specified by the expression and adds them under the [references] node located within the [return] node. The [get-nodes] slot fetches nodes from the [snippets] node under the [signal] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified location in the node graph.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the specified path in the expression.
