// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the value of the [type] node within the [schema] node, which is a child of [arg], to "integer". The [set-value] slot is used to perform this operation, targeting the [type] node through an expression that navigates the node hierarchy. The [case] node likely indicates a condition or context in which this operation is executed.
