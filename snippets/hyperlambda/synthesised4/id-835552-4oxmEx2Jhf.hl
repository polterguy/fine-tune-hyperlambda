/*
 * This Hyperlambda code changes the name of nodes within a specified path, specifically targeting nodes under [group] within [data.read] under [data.connect]. It uses [set-name] to rename these nodes to the value of [group_column] from [.arguments]. The [get-value] slot retrieves this new name from the arguments provided. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the name of nodes specified by its expression.
 * 2. [@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column] - Expression pointing to nodes to be renamed.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value from [.arguments/*/group_column] to use as the new name.
