/*
 * 1. `@.total`: This iterator searches for the first node named `.total` within the current node's hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through its ancestors and siblings until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might not be a direct child of the current node, but exists somewhere in its ancestry or among its siblings. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving a total value from a parent node in a financial calculation.
 * - Accessing a cumulative count or sum maintained at a higher level in a hierarchical data structure.
