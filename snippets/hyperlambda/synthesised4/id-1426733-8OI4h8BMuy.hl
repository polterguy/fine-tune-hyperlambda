// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this case, the [unwrap] slot is applied with an expression that uses the `+` iterator, which retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node. The `/**` part of the expression is a wildcard that retrieves all descendants of the elder sibling node. This setup allows the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the elder sibling's descendants, effectively preparing their values before the main execution flow reaches them.
