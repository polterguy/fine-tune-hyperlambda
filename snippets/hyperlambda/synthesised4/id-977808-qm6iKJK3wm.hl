// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a database table named "departments" using the [data.read] slot. The [table] slot specifies the target table, and the [limit] slot restricts the number of records returned to 10. This ensures efficient data retrieval by controlling the size of the result set.
data.read
   table:departments
   limit:int:10
