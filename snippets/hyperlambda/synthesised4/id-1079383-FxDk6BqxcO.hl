/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator looks for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda file or HTTP endpoint, which contains the input parameters for a slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each individual argument passed into the slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `order` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `order`. It is used to specifically access the argument named `order` from the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or HTTP endpoint to retrieve the value of an argument named `order`. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to process or validate an order parameter passed into a function or API call.
