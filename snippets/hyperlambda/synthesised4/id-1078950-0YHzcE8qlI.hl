/*
 * 1. `@.scan` - This iterator searches for the first node named "scan" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a match. This is useful for accessing a specific node that may not be a direct child of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `0` - This iterator retrieves the first child of the "scan" node. It assumes that the "scan" node has at least one child and selects the first one. This is useful when you need to work with the first item in a list or collection of nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node obtained from the previous step (the first child of "scan"). It is used to access all nodes at the next level of the hierarchy, allowing for operations on multiple nodes simultaneously.
 * 
 * 4. `completion` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "completion" from the previously obtained children nodes. It is useful for narrowing down the node set to specific nodes of interest, especially when dealing with collections of nodes that may have different names.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to process or evaluate all "completion" nodes under the first child of a "scan" node. For example, it might be used in a system that processes scan results, where each "completion" node represents a completed task or operation related to the scan.
