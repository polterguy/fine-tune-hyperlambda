// This Hyperlambda code uses the [and] slot to evaluate multiple conditions. It checks if a node named [cascading] exists within [.arguments], is not null, and has a value equal to boolean true. The [exists] and [not-null] slots ensure the node's presence and non-null status, while [eq] confirms its value is true. If all conditions are met, the [and] slot evaluates to true.
