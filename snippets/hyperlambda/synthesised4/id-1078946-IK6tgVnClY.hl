/*
 * 1. `@get-first-value`: This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context that has the name "get-first-value". It searches through the siblings and ancestors of the current node to find the first occurrence of a node with this specific name.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression can be used when you need to access or manipulate the first occurrence of a node named "get-first-value" in a Hyperlambda structure. For instance, if you have multiple nodes with this name at different levels of your node hierarchy and you want to ensure you're working with the first one encountered, this expression would be appropriate.
