// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Medications" and "Patients", based on the "PatientID" column. The [join] slot specifies the table to join, and the [as] slot provides an alias for the "Patients" table. The [type] slot indicates a left join, and the [on] slot specifies the join condition using an [and] logical condition to match "PatientID" from both tables.
join:Patients
   as:PatientID
   type:left
