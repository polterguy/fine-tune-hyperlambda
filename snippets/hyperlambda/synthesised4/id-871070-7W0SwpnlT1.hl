// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [context] slot to add an object to the stack and retrieve it later using [get-context]. It sets a context named "foo" with the value "bar" and retrieves it within a lambda to set the value of [.result]. This mechanism is useful for maintaining data accessibility across different parts of a Hyperlambda execution, allowing slots to access shared data without passing it as arguments.
