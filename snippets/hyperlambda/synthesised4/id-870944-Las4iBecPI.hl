// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a destination node. The [add] slot takes an expression pointing to multiple nodes as its destination, and appends the result of the [get-nodes] slot, which retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node, specifically targeting the [session] node. This effectively copies the [session] node into every child of the destination nodes specified by the expression.
