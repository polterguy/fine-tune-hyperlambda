// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using a left join between the "Medications" and "Patients" tables in an SQLite database. It specifies columns to be selected, including an aggregate function with an alias, and applies a group by operation. The [join] slot specifies the join type and conditions, while [where] and [group] slots allow for filtering and grouping results, respectively.
