// This Hyperlambda code checks if the name of a node, referenced by the expression [@get-name], is exactly equal to the string "wheel". The [eq] slot is used for this equality comparison, where the first argument is the result of [get-name] and the second is the static string "wheel". If the names match, the [eq] slot will evaluate to true.
eq:x:@get-name
