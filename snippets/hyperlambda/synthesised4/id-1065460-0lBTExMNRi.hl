// 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name that follows it. In this case, it looks for the first node named "sql" in the current node's hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access a specific node by its name, especially when there might be multiple nodes with the same name at different levels or branches in the hierarchy.
