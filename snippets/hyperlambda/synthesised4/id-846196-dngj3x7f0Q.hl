/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. If none of the preceding conditional siblings evaluate to true, the [else] block is executed. Within this block, the [add] slot appends nodes to a destination node. Specifically, it adds nodes from the [to] and [from] nodes located within the [.arguments] node to the children of the [signal] node within the [.exe] node. This showcases conditional branching and node manipulation in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes its children nodes if none of its elder siblings evaluate to true.
 * 2. [add] - Appends nodes to a specified destination node's children collection.
 * 3. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the specified expression, used here to fetch nodes from [.arguments].
