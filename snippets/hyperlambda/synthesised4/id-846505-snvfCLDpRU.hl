// The code demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Products" and "Suppliers," using Hyperlambda. It specifies the join condition based on matching "SupplierID" columns in both tables and assigns an alias "SupplierID" to the "Suppliers" table for reference within the join operation. This setup allows for retrieving all records from the "Products" table and matching records from the "Suppliers" table.
join:Suppliers
