/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specific location in a node graph. It retrieves all nodes from the [.arguments] node and adds them to the children of the [payload] node. The [add] slot's expression specifies the destination, and [get-nodes] retrieves the source nodes to be added.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified destination node.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node to be added to the destination.
