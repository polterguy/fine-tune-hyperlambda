/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (the next node or the node below) of its previous result set. It starts the expression by moving one node down from the current context.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it will gather all children of the elder sibling node identified by the `+` iterator.
 * 3. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It will gather all children of each node found in the previous step.
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set once more. It will gather all children of each node found in the previous step.
 * 5. `content` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "content". It will return all nodes named "content" that are descendants of the elder sibling node initially identified.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to find all "content" nodes that are deeply nested within the elder sibling of the current context. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to extract specific data from a complex hierarchical structure, such as retrieving all content sections from a sibling document node in a content management system.
