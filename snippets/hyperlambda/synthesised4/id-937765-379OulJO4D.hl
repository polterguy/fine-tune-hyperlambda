// The code connects to a MySQL database and selects specific columns (product_id, name, stock, price) from the "products" table where the stock is greater than zero. It orders the results in ascending order based on the stock column. The [data.select] slot executes the SQL query, and the [database-type] argument specifies the database type as MySQL.
data.select:select product_id, name, stock, price from products where stock > 0 order by stock asc
