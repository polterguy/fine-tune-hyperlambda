/*
 * The Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [switch] slot to execute different code blocks based on the value of a node. It evaluates the [switch] node's expression and matches it against [case] nodes, executing the first matching [case] as a lambda object. If no [case] matches, the [default] node is executed. This structure allows for conditional execution based on varying input values.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Evaluates the expression and determines which [case] to execute.
 * 2. [case] - Contains a value to match against the [switch] expression, executing its children if matched.
 * 3. [default] - Executes if no [case] matches the [switch] expression, providing a fallback action.
