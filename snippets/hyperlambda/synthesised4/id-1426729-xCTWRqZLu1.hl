// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the expression "x:+/*/*/*" is evaluated, and the result is assigned to the node where [unwrap] is used. This allows for dynamic evaluation and assignment of values in a Hyperlambda graph.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*
