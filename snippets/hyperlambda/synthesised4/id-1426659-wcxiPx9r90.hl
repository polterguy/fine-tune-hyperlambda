/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet performs a series of logical checks on a node structure to determine if a specific node exists, is not null, and has a non-empty value. It uses the [and] slot to combine multiple conditions that must all be true for the overall expression to evaluate as true. The conditions include checking if a node exists, ensuring it is not null, and verifying that its value is neither an empty string nor null. This is useful for validating the presence and content of a node in a data structure. 
 * 
 * 1. [exists] - Checks if the specified node exists in the structure.
 * 2. [not-null] - Ensures the node is not null and has a value.
 * 3. [neq] - Verifies the node's value is not equal to null.
 * 4. [neq] - Ensures the node's value is not an empty string.
