// This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the value of the [.time] node to a formatted string representation of the time, using the [time.format] slot. The format pattern "ss\\.fff" is applied to the time value, resulting in a string that displays seconds and milliseconds. The [set-value] slot is used to assign this formatted string back to the [.time] node.
set-value:x:@.time
   time.format:x:@.time
      format:"ss\\.fff"
