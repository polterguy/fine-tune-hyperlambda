/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet concatenates a string with the prefix "Bearer " followed by the first available value between an API key provided in the arguments and a default key from the configuration settings. The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine these elements into a single string, which is typically used for authorization headers in HTTP requests. The [get-first-value] slot checks for the presence of an API key in the arguments and falls back to a configuration setting if the argument is not provided. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.concat] - Concatenates a list of strings into one string.
 * 2. [.:] - Static string value "Bearer ".
 * 3. [get-first-value] - Retrieves the first available value from its children nodes.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression.
 * 5. [config.get] - Retrieves a configuration value from the application's settings.
