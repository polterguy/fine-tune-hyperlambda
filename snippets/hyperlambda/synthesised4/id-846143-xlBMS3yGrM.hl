// Checks if the result of trimming a string does not start with a specific character. The [not] slot inverts the condition, while [strings.starts-with] checks the beginning of the trimmed string. [strings.trim] removes specified characters from both ends of the string, and [#] retrieves the value of the trimmed string for comparison.
