// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to update records in a SQLite database table named "Orders" using the [data.update] slot. It specifies the database type as SQLite and includes placeholders for the [values] to be updated and a [where] condition to filter which records should be updated. The [where] condition uses an [and] logical operator to combine multiple conditions, ensuring that only records meeting all specified criteria are updated.
