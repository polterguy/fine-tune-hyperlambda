/*
 * The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert a new node into the existing node set. The [add] slot takes an expression pointing to the destination node set, and the node to be added is specified as a child node. In this example, a new node with the name [primary] and a boolean value of false is added to the node set referenced by the expression [@.tmp/*]. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - This slot is used to add a new node to the specified destination node set.
 * 2. [@.tmp/*] - This expression points to the node set where the new node will be added.
 * 3. [.] - This node serves as a container for the node to be added.
 * 4. [primary:bool:false] - This is the new node being added, with the name [primary] and a boolean value of false.
