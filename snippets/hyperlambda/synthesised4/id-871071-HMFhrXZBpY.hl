// This Hyperlambda code constructs a file path by concatenating a base directory with a dynamic segment and a file extension, then assigns this path to a node. The [set-value] slot assigns the result to [.filename], while [strings.concat] combines a static directory path, a dynamic value fetched using [get-value], and a static file extension. The dynamic segment is retrieved from a node named [hyperlambda_id], which is a child of the current [.dp] node.
