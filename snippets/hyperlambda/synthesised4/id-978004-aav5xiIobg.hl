// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [yield] slot to return specific values from a node structure. It extracts the [id] and [price] values from each [product] node within a [catalog] and returns them as part of the result. The [yield] slot is used to output these values, allowing for easy retrieval and further processing.
yield
   id:x:@.catalog/*/product/*/id
   price:x:@.catalog/*/product/*/price
