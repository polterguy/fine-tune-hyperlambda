/*
 * The code connects to a database and performs a read operation on the "users_roles" table, counting the number of entries and returning the result. It adds nodes from the arguments to the "where" clause, ensuring dynamic filtering based on input parameters. The result is limited to one entry and is returned as a node set. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.connect] - Connects to the specified database.
 * 2. [add] - Adds nodes from the arguments to the "where" clause for dynamic filtering.
 * 3. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the arguments.
 * 4. [data.read] - Reads data from the "users_roles" table.
 * 5. [table] - Specifies the table to read from.
 * 6. [columns] - Specifies the columns to select, here counting entries.
 * 7. [count(*)] - Counts the number of entries in the table.
 * 8. [as] - Aliases the count result as "count".
 * 9. [where] - Specifies conditions for data selection.
 * 10. [and] - Logical AND for combining conditions.
 * 11. [limit] - Limits the result to one entry.
 * 12. [return-nodes] - Returns the result as a node set.
