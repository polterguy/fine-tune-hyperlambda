// The code snippet uses the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate all expressions within the [mail.smtp.send] node and its descendants. This allows for dynamic resolution of any expressions within the SMTP send operation, ensuring that all necessary values are computed and resolved before the email is sent. The [unwrap] slot is crucial for handling dynamic data or configurations that need to be evaluated at runtime within the email sending process.
