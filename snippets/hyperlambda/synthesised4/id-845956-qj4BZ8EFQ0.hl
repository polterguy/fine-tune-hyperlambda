// The code snippet reads data from a stream, converts it to a base64 encoded string, and assigns this encoded string to the [.request-raw] node. The [set-value] slot is used to change the value of [.request-raw], while [convert] transforms the stream data to base64 format using [io.stream.read] to access the stream's content.
set-value:x:@.request-raw
   convert:x:@io.stream.read
      type:base64
