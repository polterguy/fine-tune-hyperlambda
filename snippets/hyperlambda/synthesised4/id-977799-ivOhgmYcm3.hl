// The code snippet demonstrates how to read data from an SQL database using the [data.read] slot, specifically retrieving records from the "orders" table. It limits the result set to 5 records by specifying the [limit] argument with an integer value of 5. This ensures that only a small subset of data is fetched, optimizing performance and resource usage.
data.read
   table:orders
   limit:int:5
