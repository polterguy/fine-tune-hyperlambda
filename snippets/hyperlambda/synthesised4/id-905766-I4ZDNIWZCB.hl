// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [return-nodes] slot to return a collection of nodes obtained from the [io.folder.list-recursively] slot. This setup allows the retrieval of all nodes (files and folders) within a specified directory and its subdirectories, returning them as a lambda object. The [return-nodes] slot is typically used within a dynamic slot or a context that supports returning nodes.
