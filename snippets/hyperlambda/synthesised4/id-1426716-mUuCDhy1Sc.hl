 * This Hyperlambda code takes a JSON string, splits it at each colon, and then joins the resulting parts back together without any separator, effectively removing colons from the JSON string. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.join] - Joins a list of strings into one string without a separator.
 * 3. [strings.split] - Splits the JSON string at each colon.
