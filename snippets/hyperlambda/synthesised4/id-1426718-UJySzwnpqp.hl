/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to handle a specific case for files with a ".py" extension, typically associated with Python programming language files. It sets a boolean value to true for a node named [handle], indicating that the file should be processed or handled. Additionally, it appends a descriptive string "Programming language: Python" to the existing value of a node named [file-meta], likely to provide metadata information about the file. The code uses the [set-value] slot to modify node values and the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate strings. 
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Specifies the condition or case for files with a ".py" extension.
 * 2. [set-value:x:@.handle] - Sets the value of the [handle] node to true, indicating the file should be processed.
 * 3. [set-value:x:@.file-meta] - Modifies the [file-meta] node by appending additional information.
 * 4. [strings.concat] - Concatenates the current value of [file-meta] with the string "Programming language: Python".
 * 5. [get-value:x:@.file-meta] - Retrieves the current value of the [file-meta] node to be used in concatenation.
 * 6. [.: "Programming language: Python"] - The string to be appended to the [file-meta] node's value.
