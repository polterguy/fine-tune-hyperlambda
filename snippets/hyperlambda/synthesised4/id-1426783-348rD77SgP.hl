/*
 * The code concatenates a series of strings to form a message indicating the successful invocation of a workflow, and sets this message as the value of the [.new-prompt] node. The message includes the name of the workflow and is formatted with line breaks for readability.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.new-prompt] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.new-prompt] - Retrieves the current value of the [.new-prompt] node.
 * 4. [.: "Invocation of '"] - Adds the static string "Invocation of '" to the concatenated result.
 * 5. [get-value:x:@execute/*/workflow] - Retrieves the value of the [workflow] node within the [execute] node.
 * 6. [.: "' was a success."] - Adds the static string "' was a success." to the concatenated result.
 * 7. [.: @"\n"] - Adds a line break to the concatenated result.
 * 8. [.: @"\n"] - Adds another line break to the concatenated result.
