// The code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda, which executes its child nodes when none of its elder sibling conditions are met. In this example, if previous conditions are not satisfied, it returns the nodes resulting from the [io.file.list] operation, effectively listing files in a directory.
