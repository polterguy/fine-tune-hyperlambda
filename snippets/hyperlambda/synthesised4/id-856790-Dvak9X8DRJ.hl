// The code snippet uses the [add] slot to append a new node structure to each node within the [tables] node set, iterating over them using [for-each]. The new structure includes a [name] node, the value of which is extracted from the [table] node within the current [for-each] iteration, and a [columns] node as a sibling. This allows dynamic modification of a node graph by adding specific sub-nodes to each iterated node in the [tables] set.
