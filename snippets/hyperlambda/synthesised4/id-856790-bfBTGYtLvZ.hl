// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [remove-nodes] slot to delete specific nodes in a Hyperlambda structure. It targets and removes all nodes under the [signal] node that have a child node with the name [db] and a value of "master". The expression used in [remove-nodes] ensures that only nodes meeting these criteria are removed, effectively cleaning up the node structure by eliminating unwanted nodes.
