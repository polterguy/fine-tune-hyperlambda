/*
 * 1. `@data.read`: This iterator searches for the first node named "data.read" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy until it finds a node with this name. This is useful for accessing a specific node that may not be a direct child of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "data.read" node. It allows you to access multiple nodes at once, which is useful when you need to perform operations on all children of a particular node.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: This second `*` iterator retrieves all children of each node found by the previous `*` iterator. This effectively allows you to access the grandchildren of the "data.read" node, providing a deeper traversal into the node hierarchy.
 * 
 * 4. `cached`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "cached" from the previously retrieved nodes. It is used to narrow down the selection to specific nodes of interest, which in this case are nodes named "cached".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access cached data within a larger data structure, particularly when the data is nested several levels deep.
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you need to process or validate cached data entries that are part of a dynamically generated or complex data tree.
