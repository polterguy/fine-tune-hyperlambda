// This Hyperlambda code uses the [io.file.copy] slot to copy a file from a source path to a destination path on the server. Specifically, it copies the "plan-purchased.html" file from the "/modules/white-label/magic.startup/email-templates/" directory to the "/etc/wl/" directory. The destination file will overwrite any existing file with the same name. The slot requires both the source file and destination directory to exist prior to execution.
io.file.copy:/modules/white-label/magic.startup/email-templates/plan-purchased.html
   .:/etc/wl/plan-purchased.html
