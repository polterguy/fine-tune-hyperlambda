/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by finding the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It's typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot, especially in Hyperlambda where arguments are often structured under an [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all the children nodes of the "arguments" node. It effectively expands the search to include every node directly under "arguments", allowing for operations or checks on multiple argument nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `references`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find the one specifically named "references". It narrows down the search to only those nodes that match this name, ensuring that any subsequent operations or evaluations are performed on the correct node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function or slot to access a specific argument named "references" that is passed to it. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or validate a list of references provided as input.
 * - It could also be used in an HTTP endpoint to extract a "references" parameter from the incoming request, allowing the endpoint to perform operations based on the provided references.
