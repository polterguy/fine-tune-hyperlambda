// The code snippet uses the [not] slot to logically invert the result of a [lt] (less than) comparison. It checks if the result of an [http.get] operation is not less than 300. If the HTTP status code is 300 or greater, the [not] slot will return true. The [lt] slot compares the HTTP status code to 300, and the [not] slot inverts this result.
