/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves one level down in the hierarchy to the next node below the current node.
 * 2. `/**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the current node, including the node itself, using a breadth-first search algorithm.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to gather all nodes that are descendants of the elder sibling of the current node. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze all elements related to a specific node's sibling in a hierarchical data structure.
