// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the names of nodes referenced by its main expression, which points to the first child of the [add] node, to the value obtained from the [prompt] node within the current [.dp] node. The [set-name] slot is used to rename nodes dynamically based on the value retrieved from a specific node in the current context.
