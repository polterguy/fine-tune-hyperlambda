// 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node named "new-prompt" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that the search is for a node by name, and the `.` implies that the search starts from the current node's parent. This expression is useful when you need to access or manipulate a specific node named "new-prompt" that is a sibling or a child of the current node's parent. A potential use case could be retrieving configuration or metadata stored in a sibling node named "new-prompt" to use in the current operation.
