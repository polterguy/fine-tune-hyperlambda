// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [else] slot to execute a block of code when previous conditions are false. It utilizes the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.content] node by invoking [strings.replace] to replace occurrences of a specific string pattern with another within the [.content] node. The pattern being replaced is multiple newline characters, which are replaced with a single newline character.
