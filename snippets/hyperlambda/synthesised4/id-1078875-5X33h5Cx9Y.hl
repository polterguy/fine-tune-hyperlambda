// 1. `@.module-folder`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "module-folder" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to access configuration or settings that are defined at a higher level in the hierarchy, such as module-specific settings that apply to all sub-nodes within the module.
