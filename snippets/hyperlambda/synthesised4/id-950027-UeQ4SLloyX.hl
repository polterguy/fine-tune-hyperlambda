// The code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.min]. It assigns the value obtained from the [get-value] slot, which retrieves the value of the node currently being iterated by reference through the [.dp] node. This operation is typically used within a loop or iteration to update a node's value based on the current context or iteration state.
