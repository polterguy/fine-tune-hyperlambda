/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda file or slot, which contains the parameters passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each individual argument passed to the function or endpoint, allowing further operations or evaluations on these arguments.
