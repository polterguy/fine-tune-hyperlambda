/*
 * 1. `@.success`: This iterator looks for the first node named "success" in the current context. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards through its ancestors until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to check or retrieve the value of a node named "success" that is located somewhere in the hierarchy above the current node, possibly indicating the success status of an operation or process.
 * 
 * Potential use case: You might use this expression in a scenario where you need to verify if a particular operation was successful by checking a "success" flag set in a parent node, such as after executing a series of tasks or operations.
