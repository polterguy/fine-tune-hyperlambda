// The Hyperlambda code examples demonstrate the use of logical comparison slots to evaluate conditions. The [lte] slot checks if a value is less than or equal to another, while [lt] checks if a value is less than another. The [mt] slot evaluates if a value is more than another, and [mte] checks if a value is more than or equal to another. Each example uses [get-value] to retrieve a node's value for comparison, illustrating how these slots can be used for conditional logic within Hyperlambda.
