/*
 * 1. `@.exe`: This iterator searches for the first node named "exe" starting from the current node and traversing upwards in the hierarchy. It is useful for locating a specific node that may not be a direct child of the current node but exists somewhere in the parent chain.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "exe" node. It is used to access any and all nodes that are direct descendants of the "exe" node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `signal`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "signal" among the children of the "exe" node. It is used to pinpoint specific nodes of interest that have the name "signal".
 * 
 * **Use Cases:**
 * 
 * - This expression can be used to monitor or manipulate specific "signal" nodes that are children of an "exe" node, which might be part of a process execution or signaling mechanism within a larger workflow.
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you need to gather or modify all "signal" nodes related to a particular execution context represented by the "exe" node.
