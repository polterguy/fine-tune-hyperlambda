// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to select specific columns from a database table using the [data.read] slot. It targets the "users" table, retrieving only the "password_hash" column. The selection is filtered by a condition in the [where] clause, which checks if the "username" column equals a provided username argument. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple conditions, though only one is present here.
data.read
