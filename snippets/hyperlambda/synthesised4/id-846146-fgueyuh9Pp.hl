// The code retrieves the value of the node that is the result of evaluating the expression, which points to a specific node in the current context. The expression uses iterators to navigate through the node structure, starting from the [.dp] node, de-referencing its value, and accessing its children, ultimately retrieving the value of the [completion] node.
