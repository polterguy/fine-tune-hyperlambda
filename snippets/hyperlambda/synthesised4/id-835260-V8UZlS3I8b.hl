// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node does not exist in two specific locations and if it starts with a given URL. If all conditions are met, it adds the node to a collection. The [if] slot evaluates the conditions using [and], combining [not-exists] to ensure the node is absent in certain paths, and [strings.starts-with] to verify the node's value starts with a specified URL. If true, the [.lambda] block executes, using [add] to append the node to the [urls] collection.
