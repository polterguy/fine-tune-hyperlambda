// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda to forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the given expression. In this case, it targets the [.sse] node within the [.session] node, which is a child of the second level of nodes from the current context. This operation is typically used to dynamically access and manipulate data structures or session information in a Hyperlambda graph, allowing for flexible data retrieval and processing. The expression "+/*/*/.sse/*/.session" specifies the path to the target node, ensuring that the [unwrap] slot evaluates all relevant expressions within the specified node hierarchy.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/.sse/*/.session
