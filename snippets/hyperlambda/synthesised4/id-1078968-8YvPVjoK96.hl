/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you need to access or manipulate the parent node's properties or its siblings.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the parent node. It is useful for iterating over or processing all child nodes of a given parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "signal". It is useful for selecting specific nodes by name from a larger set of nodes.
 * 
 * 4. `[0,1]` - This iterator retrieves a subset of the result set, starting from the first node and including only one node. It is useful for selecting a specific node or a limited number of nodes from a larger set, based on their position.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to find and process the first "signal" node among the children of the parent node, which might be useful in scenarios where "signal" nodes represent specific events or actions that need to be handled.
