// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a database table named "Album" and filter the results based on a condition. The [data.read] slot is used to initiate the read operation from the "Album" table. Within the [where] clause, an [and] condition is specified to filter records where the "AlbumId" is equal to the value retrieved from the expression `x:@.dp/#/*/ArtistId`. This expression navigates through the current data context to find the "ArtistId" node and uses its value for comparison. Finally, the [yield] slot is used to return the filtered albums, with the expression `x:@data.read/*` retrieving all nodes under the [data.read] result set. This setup is useful for dynamically filtering albums based on artist IDs, potentially passed in from another data source or context.
data.read
   table:Album
   where
      and
         AlbumId.eq:x:@.dp/#/*/ArtistId
yield
   albums:x:@data.read/*
