/*
 * 1. `@.page-header` - This iterator searches for the first node named "page-header" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards or sideways in the hierarchy until it finds a node with this name. This is useful when you want to target a specific section or container in a document or data structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "page-header" node. It is used to access the immediate descendants of a node, which is helpful when you need to process or analyze all elements within a specific section.
 * 
 * 3. `h1` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "h1" among the children of "page-header". This is typically used to find specific elements, like headers or titles, within a section of a document.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to extract the main header (h1) from a webpage or document section identified by "page-header". It is useful in web scraping or document parsing scenarios where you need to retrieve and process specific header information.
