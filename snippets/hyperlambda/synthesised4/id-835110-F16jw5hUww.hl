// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database using the connection string "generic" and the database name "magic". It executes a SQL query to count the total number of records in the "log_entries" table, returning the result as a scalar value. The [data.connect] slot establishes the database connection, while the [data.select] slot performs the SQL operation.
data.connect:[generic|magic]
   data.select:select count(*) from log_entries
