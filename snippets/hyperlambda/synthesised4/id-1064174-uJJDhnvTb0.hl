/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you need to navigate upwards in the hierarchy to access or manipulate parent nodes.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is commonly used to access all child nodes under a specific parent node, allowing for operations on multiple nodes at once.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "data.read" from the previous result set. It is useful for filtering nodes by name, especially when looking for specific data processing or reading nodes in a larger structure.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It allows for further traversal down the hierarchy to access deeper levels of nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `columns` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "columns" from the previous result set. It is typically used to access column-related nodes, which might contain metadata or data operations related to columns in a dataset.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used here to access all nodes under the "columns" node, which could include individual column definitions or operations.
 * 
 * 7. `aggregate_functor` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "aggregate_functor" from the previous result set. It is often used to access nodes that define or apply aggregation functions, which are crucial in data processing tasks for summarizing or transforming data.
