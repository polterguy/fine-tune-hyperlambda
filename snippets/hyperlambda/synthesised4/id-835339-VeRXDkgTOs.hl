// The Hyperlambda code uses the [yield] slot to return the results of the [html2markdown] conversion. It extracts the main conversion result and any URLs found in the HTML, returning them as separate nodes. The [result] node contains the Markdown conversion, while the [urls] node lists all URLs identified during the conversion process.
