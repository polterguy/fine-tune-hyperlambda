/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement. The [switch] slot evaluates its expression and executes the first matching [case] block. Each [case] block contains a value to match against, and if a match is found, its children nodes are executed. The [default] slot is executed if no [case] matches. This structure allows for conditional branching based on the evaluated expression.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Evaluates an expression and determines which [case] block to execute.
 * 2. [case] - Contains a value to match against the [switch] expression.
 * 3. [default] - Executes if no [case] matches the [switch] expression.
