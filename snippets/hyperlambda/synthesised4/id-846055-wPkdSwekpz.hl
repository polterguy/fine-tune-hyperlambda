// The [type] slot in Hyperlambda returns the type name of a specified value. In the provided example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer type and value 57. The [type] slot is then used to retrieve the type of the [.foo] node, which results in the type name being returned as "int". This demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to determine the data type of a node's value in Hyperlambda.
