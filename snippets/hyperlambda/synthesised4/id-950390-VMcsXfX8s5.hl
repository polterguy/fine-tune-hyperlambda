// This Hyperlambda code checks if the difference between the current date and a birth date is more than 18 years. It uses [math.subtract] to calculate the age by subtracting the birth date from the current date, and [math.multiply] to convert 18 years into days using the [time] slot. The [mt] slot then compares these values to determine if the age is greater than 18 years.
