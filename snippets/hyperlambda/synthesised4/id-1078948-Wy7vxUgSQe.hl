/*
 * 1. `@.model` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "model" from the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards in the hierarchy to find the first occurrence of a node with this name. This is useful for accessing a specific section or configuration within a larger data structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "model" node. It allows you to access every direct child node under "model", which can be useful for iterating over or processing multiple related data points or configurations.
 * 
 * 3. `webhook_incoming` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find those specifically named "webhook_incoming". It ensures that only nodes with this exact name are selected, which is useful for targeting specific data or configurations related to incoming webhooks.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * - Extracting configuration or data related to incoming webhooks from a model or configuration node.
 * - Iterating over or processing all "webhook_incoming" nodes to handle webhook events or settings in a structured way.
