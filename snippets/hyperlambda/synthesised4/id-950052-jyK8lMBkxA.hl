 * This code snippet updates the value of all nodes named "last-name" under the ".user" node with the value retrieved from an HTTP GET request. The [set-value] slot is used to assign the value obtained from the [get-value] slot, which extracts the "last" name from the first result of the HTTP response content. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of nodes with the name "last-name" under ".user".
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the "last" name from the HTTP response content.
