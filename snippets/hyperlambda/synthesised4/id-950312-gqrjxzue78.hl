// This Hyperlambda code uses the [validators.regex] slot to ensure that the value of the [username] node within [.arguments] matches a specific regular expression pattern. The pattern enforces that the username consists of 3 to 16 characters, which can include letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens. If the username does not conform to this pattern, an exception will be thrown.
