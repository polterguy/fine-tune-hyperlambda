// 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of its previous result set, which means it will return the next node in the sequence or the node below it in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you want to access the subsequent node relative to the current node you are working with. For example, if you have a list of nodes and you want to perform an operation on the node immediately following the current one, you would use the `+` iterator.
