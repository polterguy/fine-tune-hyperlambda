 * 1. `@.snippets`: This iterator searches for the first node named "snippets" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first match it finds. 
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression can be used to retrieve a specific node named "snippets" that might contain code snippets or configuration data relevant to the current context. This is useful in scenarios where you need to access shared resources or settings that are defined higher up in the node hierarchy.
