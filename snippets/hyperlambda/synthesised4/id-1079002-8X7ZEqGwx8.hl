/*
 * 1. `@pgsql.select` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "pgsql.select". It is used to locate the node responsible for executing a PostgreSQL select query within the current Hyperlambda graph. This is useful when you want to perform operations or extract information specifically related to a PostgreSQL select statement.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "pgsql.select" node. It is used to access all the parameters, configurations, or sub-nodes related to the PostgreSQL select operation. This is useful for iterating over or manipulating all elements involved in the select query, such as columns, conditions, or other query components.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting and processing all parameters of a PostgreSQL select query to modify or analyze the query structure.
 * - Iterating over query components to dynamically build or adjust a select statement based on certain conditions or inputs.
