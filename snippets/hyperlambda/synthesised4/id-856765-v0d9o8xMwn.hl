/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [max_context_tokens] node within the [.model] node to the result of a division operation. The division result is retrieved using the [get-value] slot, which points to a previously executed [math.divide] operation. Here is a breakdown of the slots used:
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [max_context_tokens] node.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the result of the [math.divide] operation.
