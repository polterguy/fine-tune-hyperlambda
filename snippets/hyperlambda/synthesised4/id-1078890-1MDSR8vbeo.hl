/*
 * 1. `@.page-header`: This iterator starts by finding the first node with the name "page-header" in the current context. It searches for this node as a sibling or ancestor of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "page-header" node found in the previous step. It does not filter or modify the nodes; it simply collects all direct children.
 * 
 * 3. `h2`: This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to only include nodes with the name "h2". It effectively narrows down the selection to nodes that are specifically named "h2".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to extract or manipulate the content of `<h2>` HTML elements within a "page-header" section of a webpage, possibly for purposes like updating the text, applying styles, or gathering data for analytics.
