// 1. `@.iterations`: This iterator searches for the first node named "iterations" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that the search is for a node by name, and the `.` symbol specifies that the search is within the current node's context or its siblings. This is useful for scenarios where you need to access or manipulate data related to iterations, such as in loops or repeated processes, within the current scope.
