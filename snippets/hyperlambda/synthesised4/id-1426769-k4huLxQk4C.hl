// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the [is_nullable] node, which is a child of the node referenced by the [.dp] node. The [.dp] node itself is a reference to another node, and the [#] iterator is used to de-reference its value, allowing access to its children nodes. The expression effectively navigates through the node hierarchy to access and return the value of the [is_nullable] node.
