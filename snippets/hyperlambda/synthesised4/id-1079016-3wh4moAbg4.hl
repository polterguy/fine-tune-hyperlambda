/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint, which contains input parameters.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected `.arguments` node. It is used to access all the arguments passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `data`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `data` from the previously selected children nodes. It is used to specifically access the `data` argument if it exists among the provided arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to access a specific argument named `data` that is passed to it. It is useful when you need to perform operations on or retrieve the value of the `data` argument within your logic.
