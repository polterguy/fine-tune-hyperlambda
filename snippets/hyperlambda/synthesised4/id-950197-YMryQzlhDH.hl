// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a substring within a string. It retrieves the 'what' and 'with' values from the current node's data segment using [get-value], and applies the replacement on the node referenced by [@.result]. The process involves evaluating the expressions to dynamically determine the strings to be replaced and their replacements.
strings.replace:x:@.result
   get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/what
   get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/with
