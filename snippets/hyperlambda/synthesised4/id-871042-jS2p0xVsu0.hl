// This code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to update the value of the [.result] node. It concatenates the current value of [.result] with the values retrieved from [data.select] nodes, specifically targeting the [sql] nodes within the selection. The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine these values, inserting a semicolon and newline character between them. This operation effectively appends SQL query results to an existing result string, separated by a semicolon and a newline.
