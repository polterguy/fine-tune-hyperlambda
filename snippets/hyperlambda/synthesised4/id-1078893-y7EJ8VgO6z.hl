/*
 * 1. `@.lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named "lambda" in the current context. It is often used to locate a specific node within the hierarchy that serves as a starting point for further navigation.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "lambda" node. It broadens the search to include every direct child node, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of the node's immediate descendants.
 * 
 * 3. `lambda2hyper` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "lambda2hyper" from the previously retrieved children. It is used to narrow down the search to nodes that match this specific name.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "lambda2hyper" node. It expands the search to include all direct descendants of the "lambda2hyper" node.
 * 
 * 5. `timeshifts` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "timeshifts" from the previously retrieved children. It is used to focus on nodes that specifically deal with time shifts or related data.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "timeshifts" node. It allows for the exploration of all direct descendants of the "timeshifts" node.
 * 
 * 7. `openai_success` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "openai_success" from the previously retrieved children. It is used to pinpoint nodes that represent successful interactions or results with OpenAI.
 * 
 * 8. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "openai_success" node. It ensures that all direct descendants of the "openai_success" node are included in the search.
 * 
 * 9. `items` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "items" from the previously retrieved children. It is typically used to access a collection or list of items related to the successful OpenAI interactions.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include extracting a list of successful interaction items with OpenAI from a complex data structure, or navigating through a nested hierarchy to retrieve specific results related to time shifts and OpenAI success.
