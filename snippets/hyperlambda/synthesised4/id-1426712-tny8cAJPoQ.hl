// This Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. The expression "x:+/*/*" is evaluated, and the result is assigned to the node where [unwrap] is invoked. This allows for dynamic evaluation of expressions, potentially modifying the node's value or structure based on the evaluated result.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
