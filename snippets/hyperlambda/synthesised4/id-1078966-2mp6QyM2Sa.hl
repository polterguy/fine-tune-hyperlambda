/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by finding the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol is used to locate a node by its name, and it searches from the current node upwards in the hierarchy until it finds the first match. In this context, it is likely used to access the main arguments node in a Hyperlambda file, which is often used to define input parameters for a function or an endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. The `*` symbol is a wildcard that selects all direct descendants of the node it follows. In this case, it is used to access all argument nodes defined within the `.arguments` node, which could represent different parameters or settings passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `/type`: This iterator filters the previously selected nodes to only include those with the name `type`. The `/` symbol is used to navigate through the hierarchy, and `type` specifies that only nodes with this exact name should be included in the result set. This is useful for extracting specific information related to the type of each argument, such as its data type or category.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * - Extracting the data types of input parameters for validation or processing within a Hyperlambda function or endpoint.
 * - Generating documentation or metadata about the expected input types for a Hyperlambda-based API or service.
