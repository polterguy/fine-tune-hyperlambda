/*
 * 1. `@data.connect` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "data.connect" in the current context. It is used to find a specific node that might represent a connection or configuration related to data operations.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "data.connect" node. It is used to access any nodes nested directly under "data.connect", which could be various configurations or operations related to the connection.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find the first node named "data.read". It is used to locate a node that likely represents a data reading operation or configuration.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "data.read" node. It is used to access any nodes nested directly under "data.read", which could be specific parameters or results of the data reading operation.
 * 
 * 5. `columns` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find the first node named "columns". It is used to locate a node that likely contains information about the columns involved in the data reading operation.
 * 
 * 6. `0` - This iterator retrieves the first child of the "columns" node. It is used to access the first column's information or configuration within the "columns" node, which might represent the first column in a dataset or query result.
