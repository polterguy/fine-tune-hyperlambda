// This Hyperlambda code changes the value of all nodes named [.result] that are siblings of the current node to "MATCH". The [set-value] slot targets sibling nodes using the expression "../*/.result", ensuring that all nodes with the name [.result] in the same level are updated with the new value. The expression "../*/.result" navigates to the parent node and then selects all children nodes named [.result].
