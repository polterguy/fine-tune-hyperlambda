// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and forward the value of a node located at a specific path within the current node structure. The expression "x:+/*/*/message" navigates through the node hierarchy to locate the desired node, and the [unwrap] slot ensures that this node's value is evaluated before being used elsewhere in the Hyperlambda code.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/message
