/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a Hyperlambda function or HTTP endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It allows you to access any direct descendants of the `.arguments` node, which are typically the individual arguments passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `max_context_tokens` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name `max_context_tokens`. It is used to specifically target the argument node named `max_context_tokens` among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to retrieve the value of a specific argument, `max_context_tokens`, passed to a Hyperlambda function or HTTP endpoint. It can be used to dynamically adjust processing based on the maximum number of context tokens allowed, which is particularly relevant in applications involving language models or other token-based processing systems.
