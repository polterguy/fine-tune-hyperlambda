/*
 * 1. `@.result` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "result" in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further traversal within the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "result" node. It allows the expression to explore deeper into the hierarchy of nodes under "result".
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes obtained from the previous step. It further drills down into the hierarchy, accessing deeper levels of the node structure.
 * 
 * 4. `uri` - This iterator filters the nodes obtained from the previous step, returning only those nodes with the name "uri". It is used to specifically target nodes named "uri" within the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 5. `"{@.dp/#/*/uri}"` - This part of the expression is a string interpolation that includes another expression inside it. The expression `@.dp/#/*/uri` is evaluated, and its result is inserted into the string. This allows dynamic construction of a string based on the values found in the node structure.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to construct a URI by combining a base URI found in the node structure with additional path or query parameters dynamically retrieved from other nodes.
 * - It might be used in a scenario where multiple URIs need to be processed or transformed based on a template pattern, allowing for flexible URI manipulation.
