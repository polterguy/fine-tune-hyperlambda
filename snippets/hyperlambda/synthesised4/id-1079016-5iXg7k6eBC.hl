/*
 * 1. `@.cache-session`: This iterator searches for the first node named "cache-session" in the current context, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will not traverse siblings but will only look at direct ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is part of a larger structure, such as retrieving session data stored in a node named "cache-session".
 * 
 * 2. `0`: This iterator retrieves the first child of the result set from the previous iterator. In this context, it will return the first child node of the "cache-session" node. This can be useful when you know that the "cache-session" node contains a list of items and you want to access the first item in that list.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the first item or value stored in a session cache for further processing or validation.
 * - Accessing configuration or state information stored in a structured format, where the first child node contains the most relevant or default data.
