// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specified location. It retrieves nodes using [get-nodes] from the [.arguments] node, specifically targeting [order] and [direction] nodes, and adds them as children to the [data.read] node. The [add] slot is used to modify the node structure by appending new nodes at a specified location.
