// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a block of code when previous conditions are not met. It utilizes [unwrap] to evaluate expressions and [return] to output the result of a [load-file] operation. The [else] block ensures that the file content is returned only if preceding conditions are false.

   unwrap:x:+/*
   return
      result:x:@load-file
