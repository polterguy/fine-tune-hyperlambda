// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [math.increment] slot to increase the value of a node in place. The slot takes an expression pointing to a node, in this case, [.no-invocation], and increments its value by 1. The operation directly modifies the node's value without yielding a separate result.
math.increment:x:@.no-invocation
