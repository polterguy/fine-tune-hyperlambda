// This Hyperlambda code concatenates multiple strings to form a complete string. It starts with a static string for an attachment name and filename, appends a newly generated GUID, adds a file extension, and concludes with a closing quote. This process is useful for dynamically creating unique filenames for attachments. The key slots used are [strings.concat] for concatenation and [guid.new] for generating a unique identifier.
strings.concat
   .:"attachment; name=file; filename=\"training-file-"
   guid.new
   .:.jsonl
   .:"\""
