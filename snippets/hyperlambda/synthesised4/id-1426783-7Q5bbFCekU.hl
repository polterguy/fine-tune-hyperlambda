// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to insert a new node with the value "references" as a child to all nodes returned by the expression "../*/return". The expression "../*/return" navigates up one level in the node hierarchy and targets all sibling nodes named "return". The [add] slot then appends a new node with the specified value to each of these targeted nodes.
