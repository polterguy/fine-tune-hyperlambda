// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes to a specified destination node. Here, it retrieves nodes using [get-nodes] from a reference node [.dp], and adds them to the [.remaining] node's children collection. This operation effectively transfers or duplicates nodes from one part of the graph to another.
