/*
 * 1. `@.robots`: This iterator searches for the first node named "robots" within the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, looking for a node with the specified name. This is useful for retrieving configuration or settings related to "robots" that might be defined higher up in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a configuration node named "robots" that contains settings or parameters for robot-related operations.
 * - Retrieving a node that holds data about robots in a larger data structure, such as a list of robot names or attributes.
