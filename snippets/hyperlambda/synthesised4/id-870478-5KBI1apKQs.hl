// The code snippet uses the [math.add] slot to sum the value retrieved from a node expression and a static integer value of 1. The [get-value] slot fetches the value of a node using a dynamic expression that involves the [get-name] function, which is likely used to dynamically determine the node's name within the [.result] node set.
