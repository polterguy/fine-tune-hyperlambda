 * 4. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the [data.delete] nodes.
 * 5. `where` - Filters out all nodes not named [where] from the previous result set.
 * 6. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the [where] nodes.
 * 7. `and` - Filters out all nodes not named [and] from the previous result set.
 * 
 * This expression finds all [and] nodes that are children of [where] nodes, which are themselves children of [data.delete] nodes, where [data.delete] is a sibling of the current node (i.e., both share the same parent).
