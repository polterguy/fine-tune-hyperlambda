/*
 * 1. `@.embedding`: This iterator searches for the first node named "embedding" that is in the current context or hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy to find the node. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located at different levels within the structure, ensuring that you can retrieve it regardless of its position relative to the current node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a context where you need to retrieve an "embedding" node that contains vector data or metadata related to machine learning models, ensuring that you can access this information from any point within the Hyperlambda structure.
