// The code demonstrates the use of the [unwrap] slot to evaluate expressions before execution. It uses a complex expression to reference nodes and their descendants, allowing the value of the node to be dynamically evaluated and set before the node is reached during execution. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions in a lambda object.
