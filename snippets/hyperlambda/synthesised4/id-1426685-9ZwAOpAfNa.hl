/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to replace occurrences of a specific substring within a node's value with another string. It utilizes the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.result] node by using [strings.replace] to replace occurrences of the substring defined in the [greeting] node. The [strings.replace] slot is used twice: first to replace occurrences of the [greeting] node's value within the [.result] node, and second to replace backslashes within the [greeting] node's value with an empty string.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.result] node.
 * 2. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a substring within the [.result] node's value.
 * 3. [greeting] - The node containing the substring to be replaced.
 * 4. [strings.replace] - Replaces backslashes within the [greeting] node's value with an empty string.
