// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join operation between two tables, `tasks` and `users`, using the `user_id` column as the joining key. It specifies the join type as "left" and uses an alias `user_id` for the `users` table to avoid ambiguity in column names. The `on` clause ensures that the join condition is based on matching `user_id` values from both tables.
join:users
   as:user_id
   type:left

      and
         tasks.user_id:user_id.user_id
