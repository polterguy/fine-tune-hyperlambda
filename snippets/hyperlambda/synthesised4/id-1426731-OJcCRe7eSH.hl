// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied with the expression `x:+/**`, which will evaluate the current node and all its descendants before reaching the next node in the execution flow. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions in a lambda object.
unwrap:x:+/**
