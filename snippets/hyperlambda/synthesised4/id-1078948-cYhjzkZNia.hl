/*
 * 1. `@.secret`: This iterator searches for the first node named "secret" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node's position in the hierarchy and moves upwards or sideways to find the node with the specified name. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a sensitive value, such as an API key or password, stored in a node named "secret" that is located somewhere in the hierarchy above or beside the current node.
 * - Accessing configuration or environment-specific data stored under a "secret" node for use in the current context.
