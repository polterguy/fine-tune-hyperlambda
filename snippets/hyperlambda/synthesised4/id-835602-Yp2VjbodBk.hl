// This Hyperlambda code snippet appends a SQL query string to an existing SQL statement. It uses [set-value] to update the [.sql] node by concatenating its current value with additional strings. The [strings.concat] slot combines the current SQL value with the strings " from ", "EmployeeTerritories", and " where keyword_count > 0", effectively building a SQL query to select data from the EmployeeTerritories table where the keyword_count is greater than zero.
