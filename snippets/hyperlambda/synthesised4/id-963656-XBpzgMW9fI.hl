// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.max] node to the value of the node referenced by [.dp]. The [set-value] slot changes the value of the node specified in its expression, and [get-value] retrieves the value of the node pointed to by its expression, which in this case is the [.dp] node's value.
