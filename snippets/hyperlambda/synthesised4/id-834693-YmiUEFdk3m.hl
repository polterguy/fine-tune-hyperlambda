// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is used to forward evaluate expressions, allowing the value of the node to be determined before the node is executed. The expression "x:+/*/*" is evaluated, and its result is used in the context where [unwrap] is applied.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
