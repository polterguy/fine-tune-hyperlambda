// This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if a given string does not start with "https://". It uses the [not] slot to logically invert the result of the [strings.starts-with] slot, which evaluates whether the string specified by the expression "@.dp/#/*/\@src/[0,1]" begins with "https://". If it does not, the entire expression evaluates to true.
