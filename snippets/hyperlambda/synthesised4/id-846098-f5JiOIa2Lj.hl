// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a block of code when previous conditions are not met. It uses [set-value] to modify the value of the [result] node by replacing occurrences of a specific string, denoted by [[speech]], with the string "false" using [strings.replace]. The [else] block ensures this operation is executed only if prior conditional checks fail.
else
   set-value:x:@.result
      strings.replace:x:@.result
         .:[[speech]]
         .:false
