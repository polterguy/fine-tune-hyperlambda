/*
 * 1. `@data.select` - This iterator searches for the first node named "data.select" in the current context. It is useful for locating a specific node by name, especially when you have a structured data set and need to access a particular section or node within it.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.select" node. It is used to access all immediate children of a node, allowing you to perform operations or extract information from each child node individually.
