// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced, allowing pre-execution evaluation. In this example, [unwrap] is used with an expression to forward evaluate nodes, effectively "unwrapping" their values before the instruction pointer reaches them. This is useful for dynamically evaluating expressions within a lambda object.
