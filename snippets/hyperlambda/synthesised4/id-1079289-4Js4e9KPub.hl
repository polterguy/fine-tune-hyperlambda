/*
 * 1. `@.fields`: This iterator searches for the first node named "fields" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate data related to "fields" that is defined somewhere in the ancestor nodes of the current context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or metadata stored in a "fields" node that is shared across different parts of a Hyperlambda graph.
 * - Retrieving a list of fields or properties that need to be processed or validated in a specific operation.
