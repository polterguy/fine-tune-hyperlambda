/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, and the `.` indicates that it will start the search from the current node's context. This is useful for retrieving a specific node that might contain SQL-related data or configurations within a Hyperlambda graph. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a SQL query or command stored in a node named "sql" for execution.
 * - Accessing SQL configuration settings or parameters defined within a Hyperlambda structure.
