 * 1. The first iterator is [+], which retrieves the next sibling node (the node directly below the current node at the same indentation level).
 * 2. The second iterator is [*], which retrieves all children of the node returned by the previous iterator (the next sibling node).
 * 3. The third iterator is [*], which retrieves all children of each node returned by the previous iterator (all grandchildren of the next sibling node).
 * 
 * The overall effect is to return all grandchildren nodes of the next sibling node of the current node.
