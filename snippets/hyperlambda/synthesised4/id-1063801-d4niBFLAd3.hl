/*
 * 1. `@.exe` - This iterator searches for the first node named "exe" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first node it encounters with the name "exe". This is useful for finding a specific node when you know its name but not its exact location in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the node found by the previous iterator, including the node itself. It performs a breadth-first search, meaning it will explore all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This is useful when you want to explore or manipulate all nodes under a certain node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set from the previous iterator to only include nodes named "session". It is used to narrow down the result set to nodes of interest, in this case, nodes named "session". This is useful when you want to perform operations only on specific nodes within a larger set of nodes.
