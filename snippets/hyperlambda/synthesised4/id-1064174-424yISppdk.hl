/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate upwards in the node hierarchy to access the parent node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It allows for accessing all the direct children of the current node.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "data.read". It is used to specifically target nodes named "data.read" among the children.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator, once again, retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all the direct children of the "data.read" nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `where` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "where". It is used to specifically target nodes named "where" among the children of "data.read" nodes.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This final iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It allows for accessing all the direct children of the "where" nodes. 
 * 
 * This expression is used to navigate through a hierarchical node structure, starting from the parent node, and then drilling down through all children to find specific nodes named "data.read", and further down to nodes named "where", and finally accessing all their children. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to process or evaluate conditions specified within "where" nodes under "data.read" operations.
