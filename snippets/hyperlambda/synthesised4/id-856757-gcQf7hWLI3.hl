// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to append new nodes to a collection of nodes referenced by the expression "@.tmp-snippets/*". The added nodes include a [uri] node and a [filename] node, which are set to the values obtained from the expressions "@.uri" and "@.filepath" respectively. This allows for dynamically extending the node set with additional data.
