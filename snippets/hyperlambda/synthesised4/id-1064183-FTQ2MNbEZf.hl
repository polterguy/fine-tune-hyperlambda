/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it) of the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. It is used when you want to move to the next node at the same hierarchical level.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. After moving to the elder sibling with `+`, `*` will access all children of that sibling node.
 * 3. `*` - This iterator, applied again, will retrieve all children nodes of the nodes obtained from the previous `*` operation. This allows for accessing a deeper level of the hierarchy, effectively retrieving grandchildren of the original elder sibling node.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression can be used when you need to traverse from a current node to its next sibling and then access a nested structure within that sibling, going two levels deep. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or evaluate data that is structured in a nested format, such as configurations or hierarchical data representations.
