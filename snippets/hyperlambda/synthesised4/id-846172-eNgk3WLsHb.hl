// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to append a node with a specific property to the children of the [.tmp] node. The [add] slot targets all children of the [.tmp] node, and appends a new node with the name [nullable] and a boolean value of false. This operation effectively adds a non-nullable constraint to the targeted node structure.
