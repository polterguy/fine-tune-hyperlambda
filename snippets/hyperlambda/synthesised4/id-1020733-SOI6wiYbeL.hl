/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy if necessary. The ".dp" node is often used in Hyperlambda to refer to the "data pointer" or the current node being processed in a loop or similar construct.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. If the value of the ".dp" node is another node (rather than a simple string or primitive value), the `#` iterator will return this node by reference, allowing for direct manipulation of the node itself rather than just its value. This is useful in scenarios where you need to modify the node structure or its children directly.
