// 1. `@.tail`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "tail" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards through its ancestors and siblings. This is useful when you need to access a specific node named "tail" that is located earlier in the structure, possibly to retrieve its value or to perform some operation on it.
