// This Hyperlambda code uses the [get-value] slot to retrieve the value of the node referenced by the expression "@data.read". The expression points to a node named "data.read", and [get-value] will return its value. This is useful for extracting specific values from nodes within a Hyperlambda graph.
get-value:x:@data.read
