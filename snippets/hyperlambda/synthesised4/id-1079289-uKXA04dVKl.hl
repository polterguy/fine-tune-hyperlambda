/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "sql" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches upwards through the node structure, starting from the current position, and stops as soon as it finds a node named "sql". This is useful for referencing a node that contains SQL query information or configuration, allowing you to dynamically interact with or modify SQL-related data within the Hyperlambda code. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a SQL query or configuration node to execute a database operation.
 * - Modifying or retrieving SQL-related data for further processing or logging.
