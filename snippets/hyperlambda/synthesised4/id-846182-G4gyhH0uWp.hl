// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a block of code when previous conditions are not met. In this example, it uses the [add] slot to append a node with the name [automatic] and a boolean value of false to the children of the node(s) referenced by the expression [@.tmp/*]. The [else] slot ensures this operation is executed only if none of the preceding conditional blocks are true.
else
   add:x:@.tmp/*
