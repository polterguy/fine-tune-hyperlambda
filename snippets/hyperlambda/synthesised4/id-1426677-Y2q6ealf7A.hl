/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet retrieves the type of a node's value. It first defines a node named [.foo] with an integer value of 57. Then, it uses the [type] slot to obtain the type of the value of the node directly above it, which is [.foo]. The result of invoking [type] will be "int", indicating that the value type of [.foo] is an integer.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type of the node's value directly above it.
