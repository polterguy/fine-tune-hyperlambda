// This code checks if both the [isActive] and [isPaid] conditions are true using the [and] slot. If both conditions evaluate to true, it sets the value of [subscriptionStatus] to "Subscription valid" using the [set-value] slot. The [if] slot is used to conditionally execute the [set-value] operation based on the result of the [and] condition.
