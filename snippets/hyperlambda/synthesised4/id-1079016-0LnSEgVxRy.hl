/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator finds the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda. This is crucial when you want to retrieve or manipulate the input parameters of a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or slot individually, allowing for operations or checks on each argument.
 * 
 * 3. `supervised` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [supervised] from the children of the [.arguments] node. It is useful when you want to specifically target or manipulate the [supervised] argument, perhaps to check its value or perform operations based on its presence or absence.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a function or slot to check if a specific argument named [supervised] has been provided and to retrieve its value for further processing.
 * - It could be used in validation logic to ensure that a required argument named [supervised] is present before proceeding with the execution of the function or slot.
