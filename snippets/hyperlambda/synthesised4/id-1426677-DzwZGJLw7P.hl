// This Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the specified path, which targets nodes related to a signal for crawling a site with AI. The path navigates through the node hierarchy to locate the specific [signal] node with the value "magic.ai.crawl-site" and accesses its [.onafter] and [.instruction] nodes.
