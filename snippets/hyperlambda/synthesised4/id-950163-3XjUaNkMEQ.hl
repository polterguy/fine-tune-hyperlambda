// This code creates a dynamic slot named "game.add-score" that calculates the total score by adding a given score and bonus. It uses the [math.add] slot to perform the addition of the [score] and [bonus] arguments, and then returns the result using the [yield] slot.
slots.create:game.add-score
   math.add
      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/score
      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/bonus
