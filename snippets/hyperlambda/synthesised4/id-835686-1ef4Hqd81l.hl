// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the value of the [aggregate_function] node within the [.arguments] node is one of the predefined valid options. The validator checks if the value is either "min", "max", "sum", "avg", or "count", and throws an exception if it is not. This ensures that only valid aggregate function names are accepted, which can be useful in scenarios where specific operations are allowed on a dataset.
