/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet updates the value of a specific node by mixing a prompt into its existing content. It uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the node located at the path specified by the expression [@.scan/0/*/completion]. The new value is generated by the [strings.mixin] slot, which combines the existing content of the node with a prompt provided as an argument. The prompt is retrieved from the [@.arguments/*/prompt] path. The process effectively integrates additional data into the node's content, allowing dynamic updates based on external input.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 2. [@.scan/0/*/completion] - Expression pointing to the node whose value is to be updated.
 * 3. [strings.mixin] - Combines the existing node content with additional data.
 * 4. [@.scan/0/*/completion] - Expression pointing to the node whose content is being mixed.
 * 5. [prompt] - Node that holds the additional data to be mixed into the existing content.
 * 6. [@.arguments/*/prompt] - Expression pointing to the source of the additional data.
