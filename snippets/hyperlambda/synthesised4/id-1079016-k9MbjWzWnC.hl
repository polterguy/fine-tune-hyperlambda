/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It is used to locate the `.arguments` node, which typically contains input parameters or arguments for a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument node within the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `type` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `type` among the children of `.arguments`. It is used to specifically target nodes that represent a "type" within the arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract the "type" of each argument passed to a function or slot, which is useful for validating or processing arguments based on their type.
 * - It can also be used in logging or debugging scenarios to output the types of arguments received by a function for analysis or troubleshooting.
