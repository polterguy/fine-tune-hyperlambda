/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument that has been passed.
 * 
 * 3. `system_message` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "system_message". It is used to specifically target the "system_message" argument if it exists within the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * 
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function to retrieve the value of a specific argument named "system_message" that has been passed to the function. This is useful in scenarios where you need to process or validate a particular argument within a larger set of arguments.
 * - It can be used in an HTTP endpoint to extract a specific parameter from the request, allowing the endpoint to perform actions based on the value of "system_message".
