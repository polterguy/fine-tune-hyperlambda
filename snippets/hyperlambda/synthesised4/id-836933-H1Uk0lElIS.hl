// This Hyperlambda code uses the [auth.ticket.verify] slot to ensure that the currently authenticated user belongs to at least one of the specified roles: "admin", "guest", or "root". If the user does not belong to any of these roles, the slot will throw an exception, making it useful for securing endpoints by enforcing role-based access control.
