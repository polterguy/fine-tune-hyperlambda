// The code throws an exception using the [throw] slot, with the exception message being dynamically retrieved from a nested node structure. It accesses the message from the [message] node, which is a descendant of the [error] node, itself a descendant of the [content] node, under the [http.post] node. This allows for dynamic exception messages based on HTTP POST response content.
throw:x:@http.post/*/content/*/error/*/message
