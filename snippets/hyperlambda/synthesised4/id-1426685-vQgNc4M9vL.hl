/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specific substring within a string with another value. The code targets the [result] node and replaces instances of the substring "[[popup]]" with the value obtained from the [popup] argument within the [.arguments] node. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the substring to be replaced, and the second is the new value to substitute. This allows for dynamic string manipulation based on input arguments.
 * 
 * 1. [strings.replace] - This slot is used to replace occurrences of a specified substring within a string.
 * 2. [.] - The first argument specifies the substring "[[popup]]" that needs to be replaced.
 * 3. [get-value] - The second argument retrieves the value of the [popup] argument from the [.arguments] node to use as the replacement.
