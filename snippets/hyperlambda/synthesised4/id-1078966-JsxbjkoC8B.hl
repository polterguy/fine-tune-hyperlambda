/*
 * 1. `@.snippets`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "snippets" that is either a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful for quickly accessing a node named "snippets" that might be part of a larger structure, such as a configuration or a collection of code snippets. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a collection of code snippets stored in a node named "snippets", and you need to access this collection to perform operations like iteration, modification, or retrieval of specific snippets.
