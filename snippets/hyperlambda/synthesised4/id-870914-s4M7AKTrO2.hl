// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.update] slot to update records in a specified table, "ml_types". It includes a [values] section for specifying the columns and their new values, and a [where] clause to define conditions for selecting which records to update. The [and] slot within the [where] clause allows for combining multiple conditions to precisely target the records intended for update.
