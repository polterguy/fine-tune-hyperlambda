/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to append nodes to a specified node set. It targets the node set referenced by the expression in its value, and appends a new node to it. The new node's value is determined by evaluating the expression provided, which in this case is a reference to the value of the [.dp] node, effectively adding the current node's value to the result node set.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends a node to the node set referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [.] - Represents a new node to be added.
 * 3. [.:x:@.dp/#] - Evaluates the expression to retrieve the value of the [.dp] node by reference.
