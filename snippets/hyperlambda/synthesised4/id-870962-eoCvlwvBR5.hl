// This Hyperlambda code checks two conditions using the [and] slot. First, it uses [not-null] to verify that the node referenced by the expression contains a non-null value. Then, it uses [neq] to ensure that the value of the same node is not equal to an empty string. Both conditions must be true for the [and] slot to evaluate to true.
