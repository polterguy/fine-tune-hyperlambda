// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, and the `.` before `sql` implies that it will start the search from the current node's parent. This is useful when you want to reference a specific node by name within the current scope of execution, such as retrieving a SQL query node for execution or manipulation.
