/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator searches for the first node named "session" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its hierarchy. It will return the first "session" node it encounters.
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "session" node found by the previous iterator.
 * 
 * This expression is useful for accessing all child nodes within a "session" node in a Hyperlambda structure. A potential use case could be to iterate over session variables or data stored within a session context to perform operations or checks on each child node.
