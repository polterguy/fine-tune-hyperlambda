// The code uses the [openai.tokenize] slot to determine the number of tokens required for the text specified by the [embedding] node. This is useful for calculating token consumption when interacting with OpenAI endpoints. The [x:@.embedding] expression points to the node containing the text whose token count is to be calculated.
openai.tokenize:x:@.embedding
