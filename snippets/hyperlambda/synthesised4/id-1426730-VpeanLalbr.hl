/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to create a sitemap using a [switch] statement with multiple [case] slots. It evaluates the value of the [page] node and executes different logic based on its value, setting the [url] node to the corresponding URL for each case. If none of the cases match, it defaults to the home page URL.
 * 
 * 1. [page] - This node holds the value that is evaluated in the [switch] statement to determine which [case] to execute.
 * 2. [switch] - This slot evaluates the value of the [page] node and executes the corresponding [case] block.
 * 3. [case] - Each [case] slot checks if the [page] value matches its own value and executes its children nodes if it does.
 * 4. [set-value] - This slot sets the value of the [url] node to the corresponding URL for the matched [case].
 * 5. [default] - This slot is executed if none of the [case] values match the [page] value, setting the [url] node to the home page URL.
