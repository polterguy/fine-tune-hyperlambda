/*
 * 1. `@.urls`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "urls" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy until it finds the node named "urls". This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be a sibling or an ancestor of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the "urls" node. It is used to access all nodes directly under "urls", regardless of their names. This is useful when you want to perform operations on all child nodes of a specific parent node, such as iterating over a list of URLs stored as child nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving all URL nodes from a data structure where URLs are stored as children of a "urls" node.
 * - Iterating over a list of URLs to perform operations such as validation, transformation, or aggregation.
