/*
 * 1. `@strings.split` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "strings.split" in the current context. It is used to locate the node that contains the result of a string split operation.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "strings.split" node. It is used to access the individual parts of the string that were split.
 * 
 * 3. `[1,100]` - This iterator retrieves a subset of the previous result set, starting from the second node (index 1) and including up to 100 nodes. It is used to select a specific range of split string parts, excluding the first part.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting a specific range of elements from a list of split strings, such as retrieving a segment of a CSV row after splitting by commas.
 * - Skipping the first element of a split result, which might be a header or an unwanted prefix, and processing the subsequent elements.
