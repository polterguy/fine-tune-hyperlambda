// The provided Hyperlambda code executes a SQL delete statement using the [data.execute] slot. It deletes records from the "vss_ml_training_snippets" table where the "rowid" matches the "id" from the "ml_training_snippets" table, filtered by a specific "type" value. The "type" parameter is dynamically retrieved using a lambda expression.
data.execute:"\ndelete from vss_ml_training_snippets\n   where rowid in (select id as rowid from ml_training_snippets where type = @type)"
