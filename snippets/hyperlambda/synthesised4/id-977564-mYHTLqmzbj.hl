// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [insert-before] slot to add a new node before an existing node. The [insert-before] slot targets the [HR] node within the [departments] node and inserts a new [IT] node with a value of "New department added before HR" before it. The [insert-before] slot is used to modify the structure of a node graph by adding nodes in a specific position relative to an existing node.
insert-before:x:@.departments/*/HR
