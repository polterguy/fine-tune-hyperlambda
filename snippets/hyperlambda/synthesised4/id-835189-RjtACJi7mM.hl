/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node referenced by the expression [@.url] to the result obtained from the [get-value] slot. The [get-value] slot retrieves a specific node's value using a lambda expression that navigates through the node graph to find the first [href] attribute within the specified path. The expression uses iterators to traverse and filter nodes, ensuring that the correct node value is extracted and assigned. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node referenced by its expression to the result of its child node.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 3. [@.url] - Expression pointing to the node whose value is to be set.
 * 4. ["@.dp/#/./*/\\@href/[0,1]"] - Lambda expression used to navigate and retrieve the desired node value.
