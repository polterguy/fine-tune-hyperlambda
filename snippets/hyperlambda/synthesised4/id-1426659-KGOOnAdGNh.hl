// The [case] node is used within a [switch] statement in Hyperlambda to define a specific condition that, when matched, will execute its associated code block. In this instance, the [case] node has a value of "p", meaning that if the evaluated value of the [switch] node matches "p", the code block under this [case] node will be executed.
