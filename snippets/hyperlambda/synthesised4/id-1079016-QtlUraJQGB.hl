/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. It is useful when you want to move to the next node at the same level in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - The first `*` retrieves all children nodes of the elder sibling node obtained from the previous step. This is helpful when you want to explore or manipulate all child nodes of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - The second `*` retrieves all children nodes of each node obtained from the previous step. This allows for deeper traversal into the hierarchy, accessing grandchildren nodes.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - The third `*` retrieves all children nodes of each node obtained from the previous step. This enables accessing great-grandchildren nodes, further deepening the traversal.
 * 
 * 5. `content` - This iterator filters out all nodes except those named "content" from the previous result set. It is useful for selecting specific nodes by name after traversing through multiple levels of hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to navigate through a complex data structure to find and manipulate nodes named "content" that are deeply nested within the hierarchy, starting from the elder sibling of the current node. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or extract information from specific content nodes in a structured document or configuration file.
