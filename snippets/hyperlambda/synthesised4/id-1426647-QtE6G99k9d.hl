/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if there are no nodes matching a specific path pattern in the node hierarchy. The [not-exists] slot evaluates to true if the expression yields zero results, effectively confirming the absence of any nodes that match the given path. The expression traverses the node structure to locate nodes under [return], [candidates], and [expression], comparing their values to the value of [x]. If no such nodes exist, the condition is true. 
 * 
 * 1. [not-exists] - Evaluates to true if its specified expression yields zero results.
 * 2. [../*/return/*/candidates/*/*/expression/={@.x}] - Expression path used to locate nodes and compare their values to the value of [x].
