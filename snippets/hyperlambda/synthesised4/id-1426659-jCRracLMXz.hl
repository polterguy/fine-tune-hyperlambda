// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and replace the value of the current node with the result of the expression specified by "x:+/*/*". This expression navigates to the first elder sibling node, retrieves all its children, and then retrieves all of their children. The [unwrap] slot is useful for evaluating expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing for dynamic value assignment based on the node structure.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
