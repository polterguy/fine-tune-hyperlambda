// This Hyperlambda code logs the generation of an RSA key pair for a server. It uses the [log.info] slot to create an informational log entry, including the fingerprint of the newly created RSA key pair. The [fingerprint] is retrieved from the result of the [crypto.rsa.create-key] slot, which generates the RSA key pair.
