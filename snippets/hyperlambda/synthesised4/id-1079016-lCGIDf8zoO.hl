/*
 * 1. `@.only-prompt`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "only-prompt" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings at each level. This iterator is useful when you need to access a specific node by name that is not necessarily a direct child of the current node but is somewhere above or alongside it in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to check or manipulate a specific configuration or setting node named "only-prompt" that might be defined at various levels in the hierarchy, ensuring you always get the closest one relative to the current context.
