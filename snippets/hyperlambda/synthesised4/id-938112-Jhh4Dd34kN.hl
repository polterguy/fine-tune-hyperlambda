// The code demonstrates a conditional check using the [if] slot with an [and] condition. It retrieves values from the [.email] and [.password] nodes using [get-value]. If both values are present, it executes the [.lambda] block, setting the [.validation] node's value to "User is valid" using [set-value]. This effectively validates that both email and password are provided.
