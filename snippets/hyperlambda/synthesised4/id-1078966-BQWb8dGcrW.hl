/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" from the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for accessing a specific node that is expected to be present in the current execution context, often used in loops or dynamic slot executions where ".dp" represents the current data point.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is another node, allowing you to access this node directly. This is typically used when the value of a node is a reference to another node, and you need to manipulate or access the referenced node directly.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It is used to access all immediate child nodes of a given node, which is useful when you need to perform operations on or inspect all children of a particular node.
 * 
 * 4. `prompt` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "prompt". It is used to narrow down the node set to those nodes that have a specific name, allowing you to focus on nodes that are relevant to your operation or query.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * - Accessing and processing all "prompt" nodes that are children of a node referenced by the ".dp" node's value. This could be useful in scenarios where you are iterating over a collection of data points and need to extract or manipulate specific information labeled as "prompt" for each data point.
 * - In a dynamic slot or loop, this expression could be used to gather all prompt-related data for further processing, such as generating responses or performing analysis based on the prompts.
