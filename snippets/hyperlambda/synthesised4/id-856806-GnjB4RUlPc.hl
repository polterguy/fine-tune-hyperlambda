// The code snippet constructs a foreign key constraint string by concatenating various parts. It uses [set-value] to assign the result to [.fk], and [strings.concat] to build the string. The process involves retrieving the current value of [.fk], appending static text and dynamic values like the name of a node and table name from [.arguments]. The final string is formatted to represent a foreign key constraint in SQL.
