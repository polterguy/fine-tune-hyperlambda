/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy to find the first matching node. This is useful when you need to locate a specific node by name within a complex structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "signal" node. It allows you to access every direct child node under "signal", which is helpful when you want to perform operations on or analyze all child nodes collectively.
 * 
 * 3. `sitemap` - This iterator filters the children nodes obtained from the previous step to only include nodes named "sitemap". It narrows down the result set to nodes of interest, which is useful when you are only interested in nodes with a specific name among the children.
 * 
 * 4. `0` - This iterator selects the first node from the filtered "sitemap" nodes. It is used to pinpoint a specific node when there are multiple nodes with the same name, ensuring that you are working with the first occurrence.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include navigating a hierarchical data structure to locate and manipulate or analyze the first "sitemap" node under a "signal" node, such as in a configuration file or a data processing pipeline.
