/*
 * 1. `@strings.split`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "strings.split" in the current context. It is used to locate the node where a string split operation is defined or executed.
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "strings.split" node. It is used to access the individual parts or segments of the string that have been split.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access each part of a string that has been split into multiple segments, allowing further processing or manipulation of each segment.
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you need to iterate over each piece of a delimited string, such as parsing CSV data or processing a list of items separated by a specific character.
