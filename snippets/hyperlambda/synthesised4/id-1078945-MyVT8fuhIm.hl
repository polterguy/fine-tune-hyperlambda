/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy to find the "arguments" node. This is useful in scenarios where you need to access parameters or arguments passed into a function or slot, as "arguments" is commonly used to hold such data in Hyperlambda. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: Accessing the arguments passed to a dynamically created slot or an HTTP endpoint to perform operations based on the input parameters.
