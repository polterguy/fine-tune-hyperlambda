/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable. The [switch] slot evaluates its expression to determine which [case] block to execute. Each [case] block contains a value that is compared against the value of the [switch] expression. If a match is found, the corresponding block of code is executed. If no match is found, the [default] block is executed, if present. This allows for conditional branching based on discrete values, similar to a switch-case construct in other programming languages.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Evaluates an expression to determine which case to execute.
 * 2. [case] - Contains a value to compare against the switch expression.
 * 3. [default] - Executes if no case matches the switch expression.
