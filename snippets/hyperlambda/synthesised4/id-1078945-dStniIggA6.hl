/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator starts with an `@` symbol, which indicates that it will look for the first node named "result" in the current context. The `@` symbol is used to find nodes by their name, and it searches through the siblings and ancestors of the current node until it finds a match. In this case, it will return the first node named "result" it encounters.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the value of a node named "result" to use it in further calculations or logic.
 * - Checking if a "result" node exists in the current context to determine if a previous operation was successful.
