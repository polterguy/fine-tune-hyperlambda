/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name ".dp" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It's useful for finding a specific node that might be a sibling or an ancestor of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator retrieves the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the node is another node itself, allowing you to work with the node by reference rather than a copy. This is useful when you want to manipulate or access the original node's children.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node found by the previous iterator. It is used to access the entire set of child nodes, which can be useful for iterating over them or applying operations to each.
 * 
 * 4. `prompt` - This iterator filters the children nodes retrieved by the previous iterator to only include those with the name "prompt". This is useful for narrowing down the node set to a specific type of node you are interested in.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access and manipulate all "prompt" nodes that are children of a node referenced by ".dp". For instance, it could be used in a system that processes user prompts in a chatbot application, where ".dp" contains dynamic data related to user interactions.
