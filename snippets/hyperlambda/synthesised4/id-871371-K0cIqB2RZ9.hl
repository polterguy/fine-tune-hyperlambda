// The code performs a SQL read operation on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "Orders" table. It includes left joins with the "Employees" and "Shippers" tables based on matching IDs, and counts the total number of records. The result is limited to one record due to the [limit] argument. The [where] clause is present but not specified, indicating potential filtering conditions.
