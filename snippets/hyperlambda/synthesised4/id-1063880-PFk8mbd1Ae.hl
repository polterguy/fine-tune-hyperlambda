/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It is used to access the next node in the Hyperlambda structure, which is directly below the current node in the hierarchy. This can be useful when you need to evaluate or manipulate nodes that are sequentially arranged in the Hyperlambda script.
 * 
 * 2. `/**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the current node, including the node itself, using a breadth-first search algorithm. It is useful for operations that require access to all nodes in a subtree, such as aggregating data or applying transformations to every node within a certain scope.
