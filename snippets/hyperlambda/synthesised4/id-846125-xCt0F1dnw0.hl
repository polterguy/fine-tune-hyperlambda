// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node. It sets the value of the node referenced by [.from] to the value obtained from the second element of the result of the [strings.split] operation. The [get-value] slot is used to fetch the specific element from the split result.
set-value:x:@.from
   get-value:x:@strings.split/1
