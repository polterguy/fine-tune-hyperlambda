// The code dynamically constructs a lambda expression using the [compose] slot, which combines the specified iterators to create a path. This path points to all descendant nodes named "value" within the node referenced by [.data]. The [compose] slot allows for dynamic expression creation by concatenating iterators, enabling flexible and reusable code structures.
