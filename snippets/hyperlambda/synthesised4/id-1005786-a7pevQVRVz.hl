 * 1. `@.data` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "data" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to locate the starting point for further traversal in the node hierarchy.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data" node. It allows the expression to access every child node under "data" without filtering by name.
 * 3. `foo` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "foo" from the previously retrieved children nodes of "data". It is used to narrow down the selection to specific nodes of interest.
