// The code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to modify the value of the [.result] node by concatenating its current value with a new string. The [strings.concat] slot is employed to combine the existing value of [.result] with the string "SET foreign_key_checks = 1;\n", effectively appending this SQL command to the current content of [.result]. The [get-value] slot retrieves the current value of [.result] to be used in the concatenation process.
