// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of the string "{database}" in the value of the [connectionString] node with "information_schema". The [strings.replace] slot takes three arguments: the target string to search within, the substring to find, and the substring to replace it with. The [x:@.arguments/*/connectionString] expression points to the [connectionString] node, whose value is being modified.
strings.replace:x:@.arguments/*/connectionString
   .:{database}
   .:information_schema
