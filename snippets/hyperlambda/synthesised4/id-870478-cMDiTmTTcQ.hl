// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a block of code when previous conditions are not met. Inside the [else] block, it uses [set-value] to update the value of nodes within [.result], identified by the name obtained from the [get-name] slot. The [math.add] slot is then used to increment these values by 1.
