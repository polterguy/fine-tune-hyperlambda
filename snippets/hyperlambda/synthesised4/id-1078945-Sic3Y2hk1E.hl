/*
 * 1. `@.tmp-completion`: This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context with the name "tmp-completion". The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name, and the `.` before the name implies that it is looking for a node in the current context or hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access a specific node named "tmp-completion" in a Hyperlambda graph, which might be used to store temporary data or intermediate results in a computation or process.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you want to quickly access or modify the value of a node that is expected to exist in the current execution context.
