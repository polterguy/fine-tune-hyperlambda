// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using the [data.read] slot to interact with a SQLite database. The code specifies the database type as SQLite and targets the "Categories" table. It includes a column specification with an aggregate function, which is aliased as "result". The [where] clause is present but does not specify any conditions, implying that it might be a placeholder for future conditions. The [group] clause is used to group the results by "group_column". Finally, the [return-nodes] slot is used to return all nodes resulting from the [data.read] operation. This setup is useful for executing aggregate queries and grouping results in a structured manner.
