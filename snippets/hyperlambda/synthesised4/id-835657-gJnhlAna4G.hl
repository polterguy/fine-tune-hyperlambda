// This Hyperlambda code snippet appends a SQL query fragment to an existing SQL string. It uses [set-value] to update the [.sql] node by concatenating its current value with additional strings using [strings.concat]. The concatenated strings include a static SQL fragment " from activities where keyword_count > 0". The code effectively builds a SQL query dynamically by modifying the [.sql] node.
