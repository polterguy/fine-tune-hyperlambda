/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator looks for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is used to locate the node where arguments for a function or a slot are typically defined.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are defined as children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `limit` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `limit` from the previous result set. It is used to specifically target the `limit` argument node within the `.arguments` node. 
 * 
 * This expression is useful for retrieving the value of a specific argument named `limit` from a set of arguments defined under a `.arguments` node, which is common in function or slot definitions in Hyperlambda.
