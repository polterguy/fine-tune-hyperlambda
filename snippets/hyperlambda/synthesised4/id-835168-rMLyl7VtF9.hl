// The code snippet uses the [cache.set] slot to store a value in the cache. It retrieves the value from the [nonce] node within the [auth.token.verify] node, using a lambda expression to dynamically reference it. The cached item is stored with a key derived from this expression, allowing for efficient retrieval later.
cache.set:x:@auth.token.verify/*/nonce
