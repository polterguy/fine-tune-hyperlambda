// This Hyperlambda code snippet dynamically adds nodes to a destination node specified by the expression in the [add] slot. It retrieves nodes from the first child of the [.urls] node using the [get-nodes] slot and appends them to the [.done] node's children collection. The [add] slot ensures that the nodes obtained from [get-nodes] are evaluated and then added to the specified destination node.
