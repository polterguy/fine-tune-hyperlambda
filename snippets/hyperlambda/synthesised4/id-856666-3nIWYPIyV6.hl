// The code retrieves all nodes that are children of the [ml_training_snippets] node within the [.arguments] node, specifically those with the name [id.eq]. This is achieved using the [get-nodes] slot, which allows for dynamic node referencing and manipulation within the Hyperlambda graph structure.
