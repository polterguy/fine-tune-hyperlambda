/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current context. It is used to navigate one level up in the hierarchy from the current node.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It allows you to access every direct child node without filtering by name.
 * 3. `tasks.create` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to only include nodes with the name "tasks.create". It is used to specifically target nodes related to task creation.
 * 4. `*` - Again, this retrieves all children nodes of the "tasks.create" node. It is used to access every direct child node under "tasks.create".
 * 5. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the previously retrieved nodes. It allows further traversal down the hierarchy to access deeper nested nodes.
 * 6. `.type` - This retrieves the node named ".type" from the previously retrieved nodes. It is used to specifically access the type information of the tasks.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a task management system to retrieve the type information of all tasks created under a specific context, allowing for filtering or categorization based on task type.
 * - It could also be used in a validation or processing script to ensure that all tasks have a specified type before proceeding with further operations.
