/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is useful when you need to access the top-level node from anywhere within the node hierarchy, allowing you to perform operations or access data that is defined at the root level.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it will retrieve all children nodes of the root node. This is useful when you need to iterate over or perform operations on all child nodes of the root node.
 * 
 * 3. `execute-file` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "execute-file" from the previous result set. It is used to find a specific node named "execute-file" among the children of the root node, which is likely intended to execute a Hyperlambda file.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a scenario where you have a Hyperlambda structure with multiple nodes at the root level, and you need to find and execute a specific file execution node among them.
 * - It can be useful in a dynamic execution environment where the root node contains various operations, and you need to specifically target and execute a file operation node.
