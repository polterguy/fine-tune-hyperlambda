/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "result" that is an ancestor or sibling of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node by name, and the `.result` specifies the exact name of the node it is searching for. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate the value of a specific node named "result" within the current context or hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the value of a "result" node to use in a calculation or decision-making process.
 * - Checking the existence or value of a "result" node to determine the flow of logic in a Hyperlambda script.
