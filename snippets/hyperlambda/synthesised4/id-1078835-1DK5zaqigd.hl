/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator searches for the first node named `.result` starting from the current node. It will traverse upwards in the hierarchy if necessary to find the node. This is useful when you want to access a specific node that might not be a direct child of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the `.result` node. It is used to access every child node under `.result`, regardless of their names. This is useful for iterating over or processing all child nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `paths`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `paths`. It is applied to the children of `.result`, so it will select nodes named `paths` among those children. This is useful when you are interested in nodes with a specific name among a set of nodes.
 * 
 * 4. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the `paths` nodes. After filtering for `paths` nodes, this step accesses all their children, allowing further operations or evaluations on these nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a scenario where you need to access and process all child nodes under nodes named `paths`, which themselves are children of a node named `.result`. For example, it could be used in a file processing system where `.result` holds the outcome of a file operation, and `paths` contains file paths that need further processing or validation.
