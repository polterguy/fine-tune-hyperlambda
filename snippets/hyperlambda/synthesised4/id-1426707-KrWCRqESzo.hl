// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the name of all nodes referenced by its expression to the value of the "prompt" argument. The expression uses the [set-name] slot to dynamically rename nodes based on the provided "prompt" argument, which is evaluated and used as the new name for the nodes. The expression targets nodes by referencing the [.dp] node and its children.
