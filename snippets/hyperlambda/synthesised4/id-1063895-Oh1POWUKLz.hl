// 1. `@.sql` - This iterator starts with an `@`, which means it will search for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `.` following the `@` indicates that the search is limited to the current node's children and does not traverse siblings. This is useful when you want to directly access a specific node within the current node's hierarchy, ensuring that you are referencing the correct "sql" node without affecting or being affected by other nodes at the same level.
