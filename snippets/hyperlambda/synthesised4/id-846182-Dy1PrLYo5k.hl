// The [eq] slot performs an equality comparison between two values. In this example, it checks if the value retrieved from the node pointed to by the expression [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/column_default] is equal to an empty string. If the values are exactly the same, the [eq] slot will evaluate to true.
