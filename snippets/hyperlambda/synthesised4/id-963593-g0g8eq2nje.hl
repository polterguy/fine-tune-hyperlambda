// The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [execute-file] slot to execute a Hyperlambda file located at "/modules/utils/add.hl". It passes two arguments, [arg1] and [arg2], to the file, which are dynamically evaluated from the nodes [a] and [b] within the [.data] node. This allows the file to perform operations using the values of these nodes.
