// This Hyperlambda code sends a signal to a specified feedback channel for users with the "root" role. It constructs a message using the [strings.concat] slot and categorizes it as a "warning" type. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to transmit the message, allowing real-time communication with connected clients who have subscribed to the specified feedback channel. The signal is specifically targeted at users with the "root" role, ensuring that only these users receive the warning message.
