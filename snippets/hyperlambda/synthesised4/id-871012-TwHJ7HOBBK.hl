// This code checks if a specific node does not exist within a given path and removes a parent node if the condition is true. The [if] slot evaluates a condition using [not-exists] to check for the absence of a node at the specified path. If the node does not exist, the [.lambda] block is executed, which uses [remove-nodes] to delete the parent node at the path [@execute/0].
