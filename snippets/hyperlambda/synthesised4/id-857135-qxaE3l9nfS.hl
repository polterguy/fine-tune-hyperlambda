// The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a left join between the "Orders" and "Shippers" tables. It uses the [join] slot to specify the "Shippers" table, assigns it an alias "ShipVia", and sets the join type to "left". The [on] condition ensures that the join is based on matching the "ShipVia" column from the "Orders" table with the "ShipperID" column from the "Shippers" table.
