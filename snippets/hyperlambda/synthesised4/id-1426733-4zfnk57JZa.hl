// This Hyperlambda code snippet pauses the execution of the current thread for 100 milliseconds, allowing other processes to use the CPU during this time. The [sleep] slot is used to introduce a delay in the execution flow without consuming CPU resources, as it releases the thread back to the operating system while sleeping.
