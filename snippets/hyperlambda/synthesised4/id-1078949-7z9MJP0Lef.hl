/*
 * 1. `@json2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "json2lambda" in the current execution context. It starts the traversal from the root node or the current node, depending on where it is used.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "json2lambda" node. It allows access to any node directly under "json2lambda", regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `_session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "_session" among the children of the "json2lambda" node. It effectively narrows down the selection to nodes that specifically have this name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to extract session-related data from a JSON structure that has been converted into a Hyperlambda node tree, where "json2lambda" is the root node representing the JSON data.
 * - It might be useful in scenarios where session management or session-specific information needs to be accessed or manipulated within a larger data structure.
