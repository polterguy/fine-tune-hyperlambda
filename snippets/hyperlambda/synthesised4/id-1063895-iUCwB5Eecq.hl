// 1. `-`: This iterator retrieves the younger sibling of the current node. In Hyperlambda, a younger sibling is the node that appears immediately before the current node in the same hierarchy level. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the node that is directly above the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. For example, if you have a list of nodes and you are currently processing one of them, using the `-` iterator allows you to access the node that comes right before it, which can be useful for comparisons or sequential processing tasks.
