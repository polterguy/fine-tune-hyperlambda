// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each role of the currently authenticated user retrieved by [auth.ticket.get], and inserts a record into the "users_roles" table for each role. The [for-each] slot iterates through the roles, and [data.create] inserts the username and the current role into the database. The [user] and [role] values are dynamically set using expressions to reference the username and role respectively.
