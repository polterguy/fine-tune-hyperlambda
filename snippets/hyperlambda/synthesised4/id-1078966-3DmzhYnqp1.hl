/*
 * 1. `@.no`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, checking each node's name until it finds a match. 
 * 
 * Use case: This expression can be used to retrieve a specific node named "no" that might contain important configuration data or a flag within a larger Hyperlambda structure, ensuring that the search is efficient by only looking at siblings and ancestors.
