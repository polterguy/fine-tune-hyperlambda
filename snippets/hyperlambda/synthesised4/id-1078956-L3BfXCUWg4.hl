/*
 * 1. `@.email`: This iterator searches for the first node named "email" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to retrieve a specific piece of data, such as an email address, that might be located higher up in the node structure. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Retrieving a user's email address from a configuration or user profile node.
 * - Accessing contact information stored in a hierarchical data structure.
