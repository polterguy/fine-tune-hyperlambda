/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet retrieves the type of a node's value. The [type] slot is used to determine the Hyperlambda type name of a specified value. In this example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer value of 57, and the [type] slot is invoked with an expression pointing to the previous node, which returns the type of the node's value as "int".
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with the name ".foo", type "int", and value "57".
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the Hyperlambda type name of the value of the node specified by the expression "-".
