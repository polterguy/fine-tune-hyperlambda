/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by locating the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node with the specified name.
 *    
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `.arguments` node. It allows the expression to consider all direct children of `.arguments`.
 * 
 * 3. `/batch_size` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `batch_size` among the children of `.arguments`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda script to dynamically retrieve the value of a `batch_size` parameter passed into a function or endpoint, allowing the script to adjust its processing logic based on the specified batch size.
 * - It could also be useful in a configuration setting where different batch sizes need to be processed differently, allowing the script to access and use the batch size value directly.
