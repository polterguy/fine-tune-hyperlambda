// The code snippet demonstrates how to generate a hash value from a data node using the [crypto.hash] slot. It specifies the format of the hash as "text", which means the resulting hash will be returned in its textual representation. The [crypto.hash] slot takes an expression pointing to the data to be hashed and a child node indicating the desired output format.
crypto.hash:x:@.data
   format:text
