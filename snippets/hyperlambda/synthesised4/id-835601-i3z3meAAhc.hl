// This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the value of a node within a data read operation. It targets the second column's alias (as) under a data read operation within a data connection. The new value is retrieved from an argument named aggregate_function. This allows dynamic assignment of an alias to a column based on input parameters, facilitating flexible query construction.
