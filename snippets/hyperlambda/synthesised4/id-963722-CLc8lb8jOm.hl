// This Hyperlambda code encrypts a message labeled "Confidential data" using a combination of AES and RSA encryption. It utilizes the [crypto.encrypt] slot, which requires an encryption key, a signing key, and the signing key's fingerprint. The encryption key is derived from the recipient's public RSA key, while the signing key and its fingerprint are obtained from the sender's RSA key pair. This ensures the message is both encrypted and signed, providing confidentiality and authenticity. The slots [encryption-key], [signing-key], and [signing-key-fingerprint] are used to specify the keys needed for this cryptographic process.
