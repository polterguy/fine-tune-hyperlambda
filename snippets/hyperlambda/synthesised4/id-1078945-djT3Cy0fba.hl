/*
 * 1. `@.cont`: This iterator looks for the first node named "cont" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it starts the search from the current node's context. This expression will return the first node named "cont" that it finds.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve a specific configuration or data node named "cont" within a larger Hyperlambda structure, possibly to check its value or to perform further operations based on its contents.
