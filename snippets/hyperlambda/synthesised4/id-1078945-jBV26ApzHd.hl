/*
 * 1. `@execute` - This iterator searches for the first node named "execute" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy until it finds a node with this name. This is useful for locating a specific node in a potentially complex structure where the node's position is not fixed.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator. It allows you to access all immediate child nodes of the "execute" node, regardless of their names. This is useful when you want to process or inspect all children of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `json` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "json" from the children of the "execute" node. It is useful for extracting specific data or configurations that are expected to be under a node named "json".
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression might include extracting JSON configuration or data payloads from a dynamically executed slot or function within a Hyperlambda script, where the structure of the data is not known in advance.
