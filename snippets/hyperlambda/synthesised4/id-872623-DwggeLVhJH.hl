// The code demonstrates how to construct a SQL query using Hyperlambda to read data from a SQLite database. It specifies the table "users" and selects columns with an aggregate function, aliasing the result. The query includes a "where" clause for conditional filtering and groups the results by a specified column. The [database-type] slot specifies the database type, [table] defines the target table, [columns] lists the selected columns with an alias, [where] sets conditions, and [group] determines the grouping of results.
