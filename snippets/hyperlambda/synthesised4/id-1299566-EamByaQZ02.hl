// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to read data from a table named "employees" and then yield the result. The [data.read] slot is used to perform a read operation on the "employees" table, retrieving all its records. The [yield] slot is then used to return the data fetched by the [data.read] operation. The expression `.:x:@data.read/*` within the [yield] slot specifies that all child nodes of the [data.read] node should be included in the result. This setup is useful for returning the entire dataset of employees from a database query, making it available for further processing or output.
data.read
   table:employees
yield
   employees:x:@data.read/*
