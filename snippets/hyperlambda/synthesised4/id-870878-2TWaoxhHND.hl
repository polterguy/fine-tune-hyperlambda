// This Hyperlambda code checks if a specific argument named [token_key] exists, is not null, and is not equal to an empty string. The [and] slot ensures all these conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. The [exists] slot verifies the presence of the [token_key] node, [not-null] checks that it has a non-null value, and [neq] confirms it is not an empty string.
