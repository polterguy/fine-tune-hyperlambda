/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current node's context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or a slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument node within the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `args` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "args" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target nodes that are intended to be arguments for some operation or function.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "args" node. It is used to access each individual argument within the "args" node.
 * 
 * 5. `name` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "name" among the children of the "args" node. It is used to specifically target nodes that contain the name of each argument.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract the names of all arguments passed into a function or slot, which can be useful for logging, validation, or debugging purposes.
 * - It can also be used in dynamic slot creation or execution scenarios where argument names need to be processed or manipulated.
