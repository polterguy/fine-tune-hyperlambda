/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "result" that appears before or at the same level in the hierarchy as the current node. It does not traverse child nodes but looks for siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that may be a sibling or an ancestor in the current context, such as retrieving a result node in a calculation or operation to use its value in further processing. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a result node to check the outcome of a previous operation.
 * - Using the value of a result node to make decisions or perform further calculations.
