 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name in the current context. In this case, it looks for the first node named [.private-key-filename].
 * 2. `.private-key-filename` - This specifies the exact name of the node that the expression is trying to locate. It is used in conjunction with the `@` iterator to find the node with this specific name. 
 * 
 * This expression is used to access the value of a node named [.private-key-filename] within the current execution context. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to retrieve a private key filename for cryptographic operations or configurations.
