/*
 * 1. `@.session` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards through its ancestors and older siblings. This is useful when you need to access session-related data that is stored in a parent node or a sibling node that precedes the current node in the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving session data in a web application where session information is stored in a parent node.
 * - Accessing configuration or state information that is shared across multiple parts of a Hyperlambda script and is stored in a common "session" node.
