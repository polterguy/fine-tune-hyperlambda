/*
 * 1. `@.cache-key`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "cache-key" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches upwards in the hierarchy from the current node and stops at the first occurrence of a node with the specified name. This is useful for accessing configuration or state information stored in a node named "cache-key" that is relevant to the current context or operation. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to retrieve a cache key that is defined earlier in the hierarchy to perform cache-related operations like checking if a value is stored in the cache or invalidating a cache entry.
