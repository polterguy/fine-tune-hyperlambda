// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a value to the payload of an HTTP POST request. It uses the [add] slot to append data to the [payload] node within the [http.post] request. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value from the current context's [payload] node, which is then added to the HTTP POST request's payload, effectively modifying the request's body with additional data.
add:x:./*/http.post/*/payload
   get-value:x:@.payload/*
