// The code snippet checks if the value of the [hyperlambda] node within [.arguments] is not equal to an empty string. It uses the [not] slot to negate the result of the [eq] slot, which compares the value retrieved by [get-value] from the specified node path to an empty string. If the value is not an empty string, the condition evaluates to true.
