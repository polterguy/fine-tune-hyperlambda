/*
 * 1. `+`: This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves to the next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you need to access nodes that are sequentially placed after the current node in the same hierarchical level.
 * 
 * 2. `/*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. After moving to the elder sibling with the `+` iterator, this part will access all direct children of that sibling node. It's useful for iterating over all child elements of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `/*`: This iterator again retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. This means after accessing the children of the elder sibling, it will further access all children of those children nodes, effectively going two levels deep into the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to traverse a hierarchical data structure where you need to access a specific node's sibling and then explore its descendants up to two levels deep. 
 * - It might be useful in scenarios where you need to apply operations or extract information from a node's sibling and its sub-nodes, such as aggregating data or applying transformations.
