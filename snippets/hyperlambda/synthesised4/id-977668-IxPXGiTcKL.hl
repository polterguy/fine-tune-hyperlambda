// The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [fork] slot to execute a task asynchronously on a separate thread. The task involves putting the thread to sleep for 3000 milliseconds using the [sleep] slot, and then logging a message "Long-running task completed" using the [log.info] slot. This pattern is useful for performing non-blocking operations, allowing the main thread to continue executing without waiting for the forked task to complete.
fork
   sleep:3000
   log.info:Long-running task completed
