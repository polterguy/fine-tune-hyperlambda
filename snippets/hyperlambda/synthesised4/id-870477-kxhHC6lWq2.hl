// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the name of all nodes referenced by its main expression to the value obtained from the [get-name] slot. The [set-name] slot targets nodes using a lambda expression, and [get-name] retrieves the name of the node referenced in its expression. The code effectively renames nodes to their current names, demonstrating the usage of [set-name] and [get-name] slots.
