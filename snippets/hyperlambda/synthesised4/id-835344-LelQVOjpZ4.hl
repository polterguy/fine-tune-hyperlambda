// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each child node of the [execute] node using [for-each]. For each iteration, it attempts to execute a workflow action named "stripe-subscription-delete" by passing the subscription ID from the current node. If an exception occurs during execution, it logs the error message using [log.error]. The [try] and [.catch] slots handle exceptions gracefully, ensuring errors are logged without interrupting the entire process.
