// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each child node of [signal] using [for-each], and performs two [add] operations for each iteration. The first [add] appends nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] from the current [.dp] node's children, while the second [add] appends a new node structure to a specific path within the current [.dp] node's hierarchy. The code effectively modifies the structure of each iterated node by adding new elements to it.
