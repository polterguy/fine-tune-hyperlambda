// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using the [data.read] slot, specifically targeting a SQLite database. The query is structured to retrieve data from the "Patients" table, with a focus on aggregating results. The [columns] node specifies an aggregation function (represented by [aggregate_functor]) and assigns an alias "result" to the aggregated column. The [where] clause is included with a logical [and] operator, suggesting that multiple conditions can be added for filtering the data, although no specific conditions are provided in this snippet. The [group] node indicates a grouping operation on the data, using [group_column] to determine how the data should be grouped. Finally, the [return-nodes] slot is used to return the results of the query execution, extracting all nodes from the [data.read] execution result. This setup is useful for performing complex data retrieval operations that involve aggregation and grouping in a SQLite database.
