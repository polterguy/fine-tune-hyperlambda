/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it should look for the node by name, and ".dp" specifies the exact name of the node to find. This is useful when you need to access a specific node in a hierarchy by its name.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is another node itself, allowing you to access or modify the original node rather than just a copy. This is particularly useful when you need to work with the node's value as a reference, such as updating or manipulating its contents directly.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing and modifying the value of a node that is passed by reference in a loop, such as in a [for-each] loop where ".dp" is the currently iterated node.
 * - Retrieving a node's value when the node's value itself is a complex object or another node, allowing for further operations or manipulations on the original node.
