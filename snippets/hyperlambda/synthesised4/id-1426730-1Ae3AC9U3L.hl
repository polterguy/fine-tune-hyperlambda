// The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expressions of its children nodes before the node where it's referenced is reached, effectively "unwrapping" the values. In this case, the expression `x:+/**` is evaluated, which means it will forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied, resulting in the node's value being the evaluated result.
unwrap:x:+/**
