/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator searches for the first node named [.dp] in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it should look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. The [.dp] node is commonly used in [for-each] loops to refer to the currently iterated node.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the [.dp] node. It assumes that the value of the [.dp] node is itself a node, and it retrieves this node by reference. This allows you to modify the original node directly, rather than working with a copy of it.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression is often used in conjunction with a [for-each] loop to access and modify the value of the currently iterated node within the loop. By de-referencing the node's value, you can perform operations directly on the node, such as changing its value or adding children nodes.
