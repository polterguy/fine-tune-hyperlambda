/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all the children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access all the arguments provided to the slot or function.
 * 
 * 3. `/to` - This iterator filters the children nodes to find the node named `to`. It is used to specifically access the value of the `to` argument.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to retrieve the value of a specific argument named `to` from a set of arguments passed to a Hyperlambda slot or function. For example, it could be used in an email sending function to get the recipient's address.
