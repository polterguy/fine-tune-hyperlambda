// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot to a specific location in the node structure. The [get-nodes] slot fetches all nodes under the [.arguments] node, and the [add] slot appends these nodes to the path specified in its expression. This operation effectively merges the argument nodes into the data read's where clause.
