/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [max_context_tokens] node, which is a child of the [model] node, to the result of a division operation. The division operation is performed using the [math.divide] slot, and its result is retrieved using the [get-value] slot. The [set-value] slot is used to assign this result to the [max_context_tokens] node.
 * // 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of a specified node.
 * // 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the result of the division operation from [math.divide].
 * // 3. [math.divide] - Performs a division operation.
