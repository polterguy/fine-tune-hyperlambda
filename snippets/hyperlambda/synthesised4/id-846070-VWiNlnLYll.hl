/*
 * This Hyperlambda code continuously checks if a string contains double spaces and replaces them with a single space. It uses a [while] loop to repeatedly evaluate the condition [strings.contains] to find double spaces in the [completion] node. If double spaces are found, [strings.replace] is used to replace them with a single space. Once no double spaces are detected, the [else] block sets the [has-double-space] node to false, terminating the loop. 
 * 
 * 1. [while] - Initiates a loop that continues as long as [has-double-space] is true.
 * 2. [if] - Checks if the [completion] node contains double spaces.
 * 3. [strings.contains] - Evaluates whether the [completion] node has double spaces.
 * 4. [set-value] - Updates the [completion] node by replacing double spaces with a single space.
 * 5. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of double spaces with a single space.
 * 6. [else] - Executes if no double spaces are found, setting [has-double-space] to false.
