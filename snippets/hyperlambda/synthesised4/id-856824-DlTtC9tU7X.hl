// The code snippet demonstrates the use of a [case] statement to check if a value is "uniqueidentifier". If the condition is met, it sets the value of the [.type] node to "string" using the [set-value] slot. This is part of a [switch] or conditional logic structure where specific actions are taken based on matching cases.
case:uniqueidentifier
   set-value:x:@.type
