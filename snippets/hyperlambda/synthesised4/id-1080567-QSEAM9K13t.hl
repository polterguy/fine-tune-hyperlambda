/*
 * 1. `@data.select` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named `data.select` in the current context. It is useful for targeting specific nodes that may contain relevant data or configurations.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - The first `*` retrieves all children nodes of the `data.select` node. This is useful for iterating through all direct children nodes to perform operations or further filtering.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - The second `*` retrieves all children of each child node of `data.select`. This allows for deeper traversal into the hierarchy, accessing nested nodes within each child node.
 * 
 * 4. `keyword_density` - This iterator filters out nodes that do not have the name `keyword_density` from the previous result set. It is useful for isolating nodes that specifically contain information about keyword density, which might be relevant for SEO analysis or content evaluation.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include analyzing the keyword density of various sections within a document or dataset, particularly when the data is structured hierarchically with multiple levels of nesting.
