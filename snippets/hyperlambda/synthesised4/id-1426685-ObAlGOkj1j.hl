/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to replace occurrences of a specific string within a node's value with another string obtained from a child node. The [strings.replace] slot is used to perform the replacement operation. The code takes the value of the [.result] node and replaces occurrences of the string "[[button]]" with the value obtained from the [get-first-value] slot. The [get-first-value] slot retrieves the value of the [button] node from the [.arguments] node, which is used as the replacement string. This allows dynamic substitution of the "[[button]]" placeholder with a value specified in the arguments. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a specified string within a node's value with another string.
 * 2. [get-first-value] - Retrieves the first value from a set of nodes, in this case, the value of the [button] node from the [.arguments] node.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [button] node from the [.arguments] node.
