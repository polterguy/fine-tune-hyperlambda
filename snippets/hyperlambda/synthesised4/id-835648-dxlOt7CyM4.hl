/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specific location in a Hyperlambda graph. It retrieves nodes using [get-nodes] from the [.arguments] node, specifically targeting [limit] and [offset] nodes, and adds them to the [data.connect/*/data.read] path. This operation is useful for dynamically modifying a data structure by including additional parameters such as pagination controls.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified path in the graph.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node, specifically [limit] and [offset].
