/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves to the next node below the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you want to access nodes that are at the same hierarchical level but are defined after the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing operations or evaluations on each child node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of each node returned by the previous `*` iterator. This effectively accesses all grandchildren nodes of the original elder sibling node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to perform operations on all grandchildren of the elder sibling of a particular node. For example, if you have a list of nodes where each node has its own set of children, and you want to access or modify all grandchildren of the next node in the list, this expression would be useful.
