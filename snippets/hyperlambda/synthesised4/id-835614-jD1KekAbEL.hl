// This Hyperlambda snippet changes the name of nodes located at a specific path to a concatenated string. It uses [set-name] to target nodes under [data.read] and [columns] with the name [aggregate_functor]. The new name is created by concatenating the value of [aggregate_function] and [aggregate_column] from [.arguments], enclosed in parentheses, using [strings.concat].
set-name:x:./*/data.read/*/columns/*/aggregate_functor
   strings.concat
      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/aggregate_function
      .:(
      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/aggregate_column
      .:)
