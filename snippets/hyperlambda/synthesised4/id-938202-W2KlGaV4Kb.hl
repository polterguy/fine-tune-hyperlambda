// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the node referenced by [.first-value] to the value of the second child node of [.data]. The [set-value] slot is used to change the value of nodes, and in this case, it targets the node at index 1 under [.data], effectively updating [.first-value] with this specific node's value.
