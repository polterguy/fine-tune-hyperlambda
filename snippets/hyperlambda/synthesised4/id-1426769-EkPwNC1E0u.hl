/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [switch] slot to perform conditional branching based on the value of a node. The [switch] slot evaluates the value of the [.val] node and executes the first matching [case] node as a lambda object. If none of the [case] nodes match, the [default] node is executed. The code sets the value of the [.result] node based on the evaluated case.
 * 
 * 1. [.val] - This node holds the value that the [switch] slot will evaluate to determine which [case] to execute.
 * 2. [.result] - This node will store the result of the executed [case] or [default] block.
 * 3. [switch] - This slot evaluates the value of the [.val] node and determines which [case] block to execute.
 * 4. [case:bar] - This [case] block executes if the value of [.val] is "bar", setting the [.result] node to "Oops".
 * 5. [case:foo] - This [case] block executes if the value of [.val] is "foo", setting the [.result] node to "Success!".
 * 6. [default] - This block executes if none of the [case] nodes match the value of [.val], setting the [.result] node to "Success!".
