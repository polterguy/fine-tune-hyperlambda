// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` implies it will start from the current node's level. This is useful for retrieving a specific node within the current scope that is named "sql".
