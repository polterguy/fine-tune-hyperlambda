// Evaluates whether both conditions are true: the existence of a node at the specified path and if the token count of a JSON string exceeds a maximum token value. The [and] slot ensures both [exists] and [mt] conditions must be met for the overall evaluation to be true. [exists] checks for the presence of a node, while [mt] compares the token count from [openai.tokenize] against [get-value].
