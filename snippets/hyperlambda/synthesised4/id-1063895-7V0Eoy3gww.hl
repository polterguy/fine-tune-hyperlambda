/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is useful for accessing the arguments node in a Hyperlambda structure, which is often used to define input parameters for slots or functions.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node(s). In this context, it is used to access all child nodes of the "arguments" node, which typically contain individual argument definitions.
 * 
 * 3. `columnLength` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "columnLength". It is used to specifically target the "columnLength" argument within the children of the "arguments" node, allowing for operations or evaluations to be performed on this particular argument.
