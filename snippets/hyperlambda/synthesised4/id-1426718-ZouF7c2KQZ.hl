// The [unwrap] slot in this Hyperlambda code is used to forward evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. The expression "x:+/*/*/*" is evaluated, and the result is used in place of the [unwrap] node. This allows for dynamic evaluation of node references in the Hyperlambda graph.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*
