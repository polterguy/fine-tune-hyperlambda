/*
 * The Hyperlambda code checks if a specified file exists using [io.file.exists]. If the file exists, it sets the HTTP response header to indicate the content type as JavaScript with UTF-8 encoding using [response.headers.set]. Then, it opens the file as a stream with [io.stream.open-file] and returns the stream as the response using [return]. This is useful for serving cached JavaScript files efficiently.
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if a specified file exists.
 * 2. [io.file.exists] - Determines the existence of the file.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Executes the following nodes if the file exists.
 * 4. [response.headers.set] - Sets the HTTP response content type to JavaScript with UTF-8 encoding.
 * 5. [io.stream.open-file] - Opens the existing file as a stream.
 * 6. [return] - Returns the opened file stream as the HTTP response.
