/*
 * This Hyperlambda code concatenates a SQL query string by appending specific parts to an existing SQL string. It uses the [set-value] slot to update the [.sql] node with the result of [strings.concat], which combines the current SQL string with additional static strings to form a complete SQL query. The query targets the "Products" table and includes a condition to filter records where "keyword_count" is greater than zero. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the [.sql] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings to form a SQL query.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the current value of the [.sql] node.
 * 4. [.] - Represents static string parts of the SQL query, such as " from ", "Products", and " where keyword_count > 0".
