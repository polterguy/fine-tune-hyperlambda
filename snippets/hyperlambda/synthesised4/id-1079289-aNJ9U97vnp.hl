 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `.sql` within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specific name `.sql`. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name, especially when dealing with SQL-related operations or configurations in a Hyperlambda script.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve SQL query strings or database connection details stored within a `.sql` node in a Hyperlambda script, allowing for dynamic database operations or configurations.
