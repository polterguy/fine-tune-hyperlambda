/*
 * This Hyperlambda code iterates over each node resulting from a [data.select] operation, extracts specific content from each node, and appends it to a [.session] node. It alternates between adding content with the role of "assistant" and "user" based on the extracted prompt and completion data. The code effectively structures the session data by pairing prompts with their corresponding completions.
 * 
 * 1. [for-each] - Iterates over each node resulting from a [data.select] operation.
 * 2. [unwrap] - Extracts content from the current node's hierarchy.
 * 3. [add] - Appends the extracted content to the [.session] node.
 * 4. [role] - Specifies the role of the content being added, either "assistant" or "user".
 * 5. [content] - Extracts and assigns the content from the current node to the [.session] node.
