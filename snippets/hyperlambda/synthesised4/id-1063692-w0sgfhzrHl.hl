// 1. `@.private-key-filename`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "private-key-filename" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is useful when you need to access a specific node's value that is located somewhere above the current node in the hierarchy. This is particularly helpful in scenarios where the node's position is not fixed, but its name is unique within the scope.
