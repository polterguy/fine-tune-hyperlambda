// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a "Content-Type" header with the value "application/json" to all HTTP requests within the current context. The [add] slot is used to insert this header into each [headers] node found in any HTTP request nodes (e.g., [http.get], [http.post], etc.) within the specified path. This ensures that the requests are treated as JSON requests.
