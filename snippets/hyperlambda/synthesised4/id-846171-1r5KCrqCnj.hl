// The provided Hyperlambda code uses the [else] slot to execute a block of code when previous conditions are not met. It sets the value of the [type] node by concatenating several argument values, including [pkName], [pkType], and [pkLength], with additional static strings to form a SQL primary key definition string. The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine these values and strings into a single string.
