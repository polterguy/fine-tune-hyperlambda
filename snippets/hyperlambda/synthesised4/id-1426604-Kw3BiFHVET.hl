// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] block to define a specific condition or value that, when matched, will execute the associated lambda object. Each [case] node must have a value, either a constant or an expression, that is compared against the evaluated value of the [switch] node. If the [switch] node's value matches the value of a [case] node, the code within that [case] node is executed. If no [case] node matches, and a [default] node is present, the [default] node's code is executed instead. The [case] slot is crucial for implementing conditional branching based on multiple potential values.
