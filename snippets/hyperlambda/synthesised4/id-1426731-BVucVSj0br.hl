/*
 * This Hyperlambda code takes the first and second parts of a split string and concatenates them with "://" in between, then sets this concatenated string as the value of the [.domain] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.domain] node to the result of the concatenation.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one single string.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@strings.split/0] - Retrieves the first part of the split string.
 * 4. [.] - A static string value "://".
 * 5. [get-value:x:@strings.split/1] - Retrieves the second part of the split string.
