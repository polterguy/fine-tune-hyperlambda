// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "sql" that is either a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It is particularly useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located at various levels within the hierarchy, ensuring you get the closest one in terms of hierarchy proximity. This is often used when you have a node structure where the "sql" node can appear at different levels, and you want to ensure you're referencing the correct one without explicitly traversing each level.
