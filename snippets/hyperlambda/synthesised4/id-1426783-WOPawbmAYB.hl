/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node by retrieving a specific element from a previously split string. It sets the value of the [.to] node to the second element of the result from a [strings.split] operation.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a node, in this case, the second element from a split string operation.
