// // This Hyperlambda code sends a signal using the [sockets.signal] slot to notify subscribers about a session's completion. It targets a specific session identified by the expression [x:@.session]. The [args] node contains a single argument [finished] with a boolean value of true, which is transmitted as a JSON object to all connected clients subscribed to the specified session. This allows real-time communication to inform clients that a session has finished. The [args] node is optional, but in this case, it is used to provide additional context about the signal being sent.
