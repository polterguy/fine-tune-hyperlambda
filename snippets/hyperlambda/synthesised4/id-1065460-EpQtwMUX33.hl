// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `.sql` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node with the specified name, and the `.` implies that it starts the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate the `.sql` node, which might contain SQL-related data or commands, within the current execution scope.
