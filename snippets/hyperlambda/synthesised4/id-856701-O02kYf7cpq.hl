// The code uses [set-value] to change the value of the [.time-challenge] node to the result of a [get-value] operation. The [get-value] retrieves the value of the second node (index 1) from the result of a [strings.split] operation. This effectively assigns a specific part of a split string to [.time-challenge].
set-value:x:@.time-challenge
   get-value:x:@strings.split/1
