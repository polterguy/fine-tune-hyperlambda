/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot, particularly in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints where arguments are defined under an [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or slot, regardless of their specific names.
 * 
 * 3. `link` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "link" among the children of the [.arguments] node. It is used to specifically access the argument named "link" if it exists.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint to retrieve a specific argument named "link" that was passed to it. This is useful in scenarios where the slot or endpoint needs to process or validate a URL or reference passed as an argument.
