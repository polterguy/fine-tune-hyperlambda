// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.title] node to the first title node found in the result of the [html2markdown] conversion. It uses [set-value] to change the value of [.title] and [get-value] to retrieve the title from the converted markdown. The expression [@html2markdown/*/title/[0,1]] is used to locate the first title node in the converted markdown structure.
set-value:x:@.title
