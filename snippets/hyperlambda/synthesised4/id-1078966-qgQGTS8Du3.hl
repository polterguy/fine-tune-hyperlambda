/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the root node of arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any nodes that are direct children of "arguments".
 * 
 * 3. `images` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "images" from the previously retrieved child nodes of "arguments". It is used to specifically access a node named "images" that is a child of "arguments".
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to access an "images" node that is passed as an argument to a Hyperlambda slot or function. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or manipulate image data that is provided as part of the input arguments.
