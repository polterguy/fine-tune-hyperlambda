/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a session node exists and is not null within the arguments node. It uses the [and] slot to combine two conditions: [exists] to verify the presence of the session node, and [not-null] to ensure the session node has a non-null value. If both conditions are true, the [and] slot evaluates to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Combines multiple conditions and evaluates to true if all conditions are true.
 * 2. [exists] - Checks if the specified node exists within the arguments.
 * 3. [not-null] - Checks if the specified node has a non-null value.
