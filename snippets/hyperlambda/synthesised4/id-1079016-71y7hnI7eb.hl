/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context with the name "session". It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with that name. This is useful for accessing session-related data or settings that are stored in a node named "session" within the current execution context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving user session information in a web application to check authentication status or user preferences.
 * - Accessing session-specific configuration settings or variables that are shared across different parts of an application.
