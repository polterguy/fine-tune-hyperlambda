// The [data.transaction.rollback] slot is used to explicitly roll back an open transaction in a database. This ensures that any changes made during the transaction are not saved to the database, effectively undoing all operations performed within the transaction's scope. This slot is crucial for maintaining data integrity, especially in scenarios where an error occurs, and you need to revert the database to its previous state.
