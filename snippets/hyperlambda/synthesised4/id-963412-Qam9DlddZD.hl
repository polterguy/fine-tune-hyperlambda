// This Hyperlambda code connects to a PostgreSQL database named "authdb" and deletes records from the "sessions" table where the "expires_at" field is less than the current date and time. It uses the [pgsql.connect] slot to establish the database connection, [date.now] to get the current date and time, and [pgsql.delete] with a [where] clause to specify the condition for deletion.
pgsql.connect:authdb
