// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, `media` and `posts`, using the `post_id` field as the joining key. The join is aliased as `post_id` to clarify the reference to the `posts` table. The `on` clause specifies the condition for the join, ensuring that the `post_id` from the `media` table matches the `id` from the `posts` table. This setup allows for retrieving all records from the `media` table, along with matching records from the `posts` table, if available.
