// This code snippet uses the [math.add] slot to sum the values of two nodes, [balance1] and [balance2], located as children of the [user] node. The [get-value] slot retrieves the values of these nodes, and [math.add] calculates their sum.
math.add
   get-value:x:@.user/*/balance1
   get-value:x:@.user/*/balance2
