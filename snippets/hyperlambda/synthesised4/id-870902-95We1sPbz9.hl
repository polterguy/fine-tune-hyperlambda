// This code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes to a Hyperlambda structure using the [add] slot. It retrieves nodes from the [data.read] node set using [get-nodes] and appends them under the [data.execute] node. The [add] slot is used to modify the structure by including additional nodes dynamically.
