// This Hyperlambda code updates the value of the [sum] node within the [totals] node by adding together the values of [balance1] and [balance2] nodes found within the [user] node. The [set-value] slot is used to assign the result of the [math.add] operation, which retrieves the values of [balance1] and [balance2] using [get-value].
