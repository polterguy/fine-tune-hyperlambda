// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In the given example, [unwrap] is applied with the expression "x:+/*/*", which will evaluate and replace the node's value with the result of this expression. This allows for forward evaluation of expressions, making it useful when invoking lambda objects with expressions that need to be evaluated before execution.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
