// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, [unwrap] is applied to the next sibling node, ensuring that any expressions are evaluated before the subsequent node is processed. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions within a lambda object, allowing for dynamic value assignment prior to execution.
