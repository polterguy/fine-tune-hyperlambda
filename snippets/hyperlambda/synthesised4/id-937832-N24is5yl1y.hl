// The code snippet demonstrates how to delete records from the "PlaylistTrack" table in a SQLite database using the [data.delete] slot. The [database-type] specifies the database as SQLite, and the [table] indicates the target table for deletion. The [where] clause, combined with [and], allows for specifying conditions to filter which records should be deleted.
