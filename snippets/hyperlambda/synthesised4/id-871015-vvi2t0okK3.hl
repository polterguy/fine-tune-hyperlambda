// This Hyperlambda code checks if a condition is true using [if]. If true, it creates a new entry in the "ml_blocked_ips" table with the client's IP address and user ID using [data.create]. It logs the request headers and a message indicating the IP was blocked using [add] and [log.info]. Finally, it throws an exception with a public message and a status code of 401 using [throw].
