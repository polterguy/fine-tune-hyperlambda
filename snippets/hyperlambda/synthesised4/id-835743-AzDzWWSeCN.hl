// This Hyperlambda code sets an HTTP response header to control caching behavior. By using the [response.headers.set] slot, it specifies that the response can be cached publicly and should be stored for a maximum of 300 seconds. This is useful for optimizing web performance by allowing clients and proxies to cache the response for a specified duration.
response.headers.set
   Cache-Control:public, max-age=300
