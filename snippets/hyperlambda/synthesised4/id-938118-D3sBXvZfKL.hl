// The code demonstrates how to perform an SQL join using Hyperlambda, specifically an inner join between the "people" and "salary" tables based on matching IDs. It specifies the columns to be retrieved from the joined tables, namely "monthly" from "salary" and "first_name" and "last_name" from "people". The [sql.read] slot is used to read data, and the [join] slot specifies the join conditions.
sql.read

         and
            people.id:salary.people_id
   columns

      people.last_name
