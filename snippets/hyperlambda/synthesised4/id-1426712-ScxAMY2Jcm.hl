// This Hyperlambda code snippet evaluates whether the value of the node [has-sent-waiting] is not equal to true. It uses the [neq] slot to perform a "not equal" comparison between the value retrieved from the [has-sent-waiting] node and a boolean value of true. If the values are not the same, the [neq] slot will evaluate to true.
