// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database using a predefined connection string and executes a SQL delete statement on a non-existing table, demonstrating how to use the [data.execute] slot for operations where the result is not needed. The example is intended to illustrate error handling by deliberately causing an exception due to the non-existing table.
