// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each node in the result of the [csv2lambda] slot, converts their names to lowercase, and replaces any character not in the specified set with an underscore. It uses [for-each] to loop through nodes, [get-name] and [set-name] to retrieve and modify node names, and [strings.to-lower] and [strings.replace-not-of] for string manipulation.
