// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced, allowing for forward evaluation. In this example, it unwraps all nodes at a specific path, enabling dynamic manipulation of node values before execution. The expression `x:+/*/*` targets specific nodes for evaluation.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
