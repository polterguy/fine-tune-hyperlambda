// 1. `@.file-path`: This iterator searches for the first node named "file-path" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks for a sibling or child node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate the value of a specific node named "file-path" within the current scope of your Hyperlambda code.
