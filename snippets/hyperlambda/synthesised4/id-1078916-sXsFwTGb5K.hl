/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. It's typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an HTTP endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It's used to access all argument nodes provided under the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `references` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `references`. It's used to specifically target nodes that are named `references` among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to access a specific argument named `references` passed to it. This is useful in scenarios where you need to process or validate a list of references provided as input to your function or endpoint.
