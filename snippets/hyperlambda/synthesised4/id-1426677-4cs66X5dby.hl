/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet modifies the value of a node named [url] within the [.arguments] node by prepending "https://" to its current value. It uses the [set-value] slot to change the value and the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate the "https://" prefix with the existing URL value. The [get-value] slot retrieves the current value of the [url] node to be concatenated. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 3. [.] - Represents a static string value to be concatenated.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the current value of the [url] node within [.arguments].
