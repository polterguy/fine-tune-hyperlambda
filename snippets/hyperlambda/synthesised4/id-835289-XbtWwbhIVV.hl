// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet concatenates and updates the value of a node named [.sql]. It retrieves the current value of [.sql], appends the name and type of a node referenced by [.dp], and inserts a space between them. This operation is useful for dynamically building SQL queries or similar string-based constructs. The slots used are: [set-value], [strings.concat], [get-value].
set-value:x:@.sql
   strings.concat
      get-value:x:@.sql
      get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/name
      .:" "
      get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/type
