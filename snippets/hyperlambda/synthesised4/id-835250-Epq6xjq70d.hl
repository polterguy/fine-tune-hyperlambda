// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node it references is reached, allowing forward evaluation. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate the expression pointing to the next sibling node, ensuring its value is resolved before execution continues. This is useful for dynamically resolving values in a Hyperlambda graph.
