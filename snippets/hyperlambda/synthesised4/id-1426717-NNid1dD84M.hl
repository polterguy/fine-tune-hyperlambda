// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot in Hyperlambda to retrieve the type name of a node's value. In this example, a node named [.foo] is assigned an integer value of 57, and the [type] slot is used to obtain the type name of the value, which is "int". The [type] slot is useful for dynamically determining the data type of a node's value in Hyperlambda.
