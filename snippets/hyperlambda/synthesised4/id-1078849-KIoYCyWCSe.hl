/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator looks for the first node named ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, starting from the current position in the hierarchy and moving upwards if necessary. This is useful when you need to access a node that is not a direct child of the current node but exists somewhere in the hierarchy above.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator retrieves the value of the node found by the previous iterator as a node by reference. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is itself a node, allowing you to manipulate the original node directly. This is particularly useful when you want to work with the node's value as a separate node structure.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It is used to access all immediate child nodes of the ".dp" node's value, which was retrieved by reference. This is helpful when you need to perform operations on all child nodes of a specific node.
 * 
 * 4. `prompt` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "prompt". It selects nodes named "prompt" from the children of the node obtained in the previous step. This is useful when you need to focus on specific nodes within a larger set, such as extracting prompts from a collection of nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a data structure containing various nodes, and you need to extract and manipulate nodes specifically named "prompt" that are children of a node referenced by ".dp". This could be useful in a system that processes dynamic prompts or configurations stored in a hierarchical format.
