/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and retrieve the value of a specific node within a hierarchical structure. It targets the node with the name [.url] located under the [.onafter] node, which is a child of the [magic.ai.crawl-site] node. The [unwrap] slot ensures that any expressions within the targeted node are evaluated, and the resulting value is returned. This is useful for dynamically obtaining the URL value after a specific signal or event has been processed.
 * 
 * 1. [unwrap] - Evaluates and retrieves the value of a node specified by an expression.
 * 2. [./*/signal/=magic.ai.crawl-site/*/.onafter/*/.url] - The expression used to locate the [.url] node within the hierarchy, starting from the current node context.
