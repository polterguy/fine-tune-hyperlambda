/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" starting from the current context. It's often used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `/session`: This iterator filters the results to only include nodes named "session" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target a node named "session" within the arguments.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or endpoint to retrieve the "session" argument passed to it, which might contain session-related data such as user authentication information or session variables.
 * - It can be used to validate or manipulate session data within a function, ensuring that session-specific operations are performed correctly.
