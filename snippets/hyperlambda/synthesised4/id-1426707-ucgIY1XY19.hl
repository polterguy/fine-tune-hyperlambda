// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, it evaluates the expression specified by the "+" iterator, which refers to the next sibling node. This allows the value of the sibling node to be "unwrapped" and evaluated before the execution pointer reaches it.
