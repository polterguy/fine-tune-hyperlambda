/*
 * This Hyperlambda code iterates over each node in the result of the [xml2lambda] conversion, and for each node, it performs a series of operations to modify and add data to a file. Specifically, it unwraps certain nodes, sets names for nodes using values from arguments, and appends these nodes to a file data structure. The operations include setting node names to "prompt" and "completion" based on argument values, and adding these nodes to a [.file-data] structure.
 * 
 * 1. [for-each] - Iterates over each node in the result of the [xml2lambda] conversion.
 * 2. [unwrap] - Unwraps nodes at a specific path in the node structure.
 * 3. [set-name] - Sets the name of nodes to "prompt" using values from arguments.
 * 4. [set-name] - Sets the name of nodes to "completion" using values from arguments.
 * 5. [add] - Appends the modified nodes to a [.file-data] structure.
 * 6. [prompt] - Node that stores the prompt value extracted from the node structure.
 * 7. [completion] - Node that stores the completion value extracted from the node structure.
