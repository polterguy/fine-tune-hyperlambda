/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator starts by locating the first node named `.dp` in the current context. The `@` symbol signifies that it looks for a node with the specified name, which is `.dp` in this case. This is often used to reference a specific node that is expected to be present in the current execution context, such as a data point or a parameter node.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found in the previous step. It assumes that the value of the `.dp` node is itself a node, allowing direct access to this node by reference. This is useful when you want to manipulate or navigate through the node structure that is stored as the value of another node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous step. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing further navigation or processing of these children nodes.
 * 
 * 4. `dflt_value` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `dflt_value`. After retrieving all children nodes with the `*` iterator, this step narrows down the selection to those specifically named `dflt_value`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access a default value stored within a complex data structure. For example, if `.dp` represents a configuration or settings node, and each setting has a `dflt_value` node, this expression would allow you to retrieve the default values for processing or validation purposes.
 * - It can also be useful in a data transformation task where you need to extract default values from a dataset for comparison or to apply them as fallback values in case other values are missing.
