// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.create] slot to insert a record into a database table named "hyperlambda". It specifies the table name and uses the [values] node to define the fields and their corresponding values. The fields include [code], which is set using the [lambda2hyper] slot, and [prompt] and [validation], which are set using lambda expressions pointing to existing nodes. This approach ensures that the data is inserted safely, preventing SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries.
