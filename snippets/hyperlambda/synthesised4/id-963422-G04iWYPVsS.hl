// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] logical operator to evaluate multiple conditions. It checks if the [id] node is equal to the integer value 101 using the [eq] slot. The [and] slot will only evaluate to true if all its child conditions are true, in this case, if the [id] node equals 101.
