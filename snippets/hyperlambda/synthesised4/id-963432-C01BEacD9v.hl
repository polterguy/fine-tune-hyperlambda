// The code creates a new JWT token for a user named "julia" with the role "admin". It specifies an expiration time for the token using a mathematical addition operation, which likely calculates the expiration based on a current time value. The [auth.ticket.create] slot is used to generate the token, while the [math.add] slot is used to compute the expiration time.
