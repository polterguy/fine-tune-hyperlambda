// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a node named [case] with a value of "gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct" and then appends a child node to it named [tokens] with an integer value of 4096 and another child node named [chat] with a boolean value of false. The [add] slot is used to append these nodes to the current node structure, and the [x:@.dp/#] expression references the node to which the new nodes are added.
