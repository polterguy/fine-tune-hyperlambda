/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is useful when you need to access nodes from the top of the hierarchy, regardless of the current node's position.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children nodes of the root node.
 * 3. `.foo1` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "foo1". It is used to narrow down the selection to specific nodes by name.
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "foo1" node(s) obtained from the previous step. It is used to access the descendants of the "foo1" node(s).
