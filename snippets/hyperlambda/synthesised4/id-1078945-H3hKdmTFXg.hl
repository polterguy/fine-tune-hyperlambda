// 1. `@.from`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "from" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will not traverse sibling nodes, only direct ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is a direct ancestor of the current node, such as retrieving configuration settings or metadata that are defined higher up in the node hierarchy.
