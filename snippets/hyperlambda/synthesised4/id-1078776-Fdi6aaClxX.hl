/*
 * 1. `@whitelist`: This iterator searches for the first node named "whitelist" in the current context. It starts from the current node and traverses upwards and sideways in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to access a specific node that might not be a direct child of the current node but exists somewhere in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "whitelist" node. It allows you to access each child node under "whitelist", which can be useful for iterating over a list of items or processing each child node individually.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access and process all entries in a whitelist, such as checking if a particular entry exists or performing operations on each entry in the whitelist.
 * - It can be used in security-related applications where you need to verify or manipulate a list of allowed entities or actions.
