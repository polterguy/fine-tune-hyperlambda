// This Hyperlambda code sends a signal using the [sockets.signal] slot to a session specified by the expression [x:@.session]. It transmits a message to the subscribers, where the message content is derived from a JSON structure. The JSON is first converted to a lambda structure using [json2lambda], and the specific content to be sent is extracted from the path [*/choices/0/*/delta/*/content] within the converted lambda. The [args] node contains the message to be sent to the session subscribers.
