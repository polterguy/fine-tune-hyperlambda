// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a table named "ml_types" using the [data.read] slot. It specifies the columns "max_context_tokens", "api_key", and "model" to be retrieved. The [where] clause is used to filter the results, ensuring that the "type" column matches the value passed in the [.arguments] node. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple conditions, although only one condition is specified here.
