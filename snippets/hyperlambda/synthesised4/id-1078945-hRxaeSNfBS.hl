/*
 * 1. `@.session` - This iterator looks for the first node named "session" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors.
 * 
 * 2. `**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the current node, including the node itself. It performs a breadth-first search, meaning it will traverse the tree level by level.
 * 
 * 3. `role` - This iterator filters the previous result set to include only nodes named "role". It will look for nodes named "role" among the descendants of the "session" node.
 * 
 * 4. `=developer` - This iterator filters the nodes to include only those whose value is "developer". It applies this filter to the nodes named "role" from the previous step.
 * 
 * 5. `[0,1]` - This iterator retrieves a subset of the previous result set. It starts from the first node (index 0) and includes only one node. This effectively selects the first "role" node with the value "developer".
 * 
 * 6. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. After selecting the "role" node with the value "developer", it moves up to its parent node.
 * 
 * 7. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It applies this to the parent node of the selected "role" node.
 * 
 * 8. `content` - This iterator filters the previous result set to include only nodes named "content". It looks for "content" nodes among the children of the parent node of the "role" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a system where user sessions are stored in a hierarchical structure, and you need to find the content associated with a session where the user's role is "developer". It can help in extracting specific information related to developers from session data.
