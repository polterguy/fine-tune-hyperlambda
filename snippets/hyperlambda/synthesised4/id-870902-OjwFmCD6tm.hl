/*
 * This code checks if there are no nodes matching a specific path within a data structure using [not-exists]. If the condition is true, it removes nodes at two specified paths using [remove-nodes]. The paths targeted for removal are within "data.read" and "data.delete" sections under "data.connect". The use of [not-exists] ensures that the removal only occurs if the specified nodes do not exist. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Begins a conditional statement.
 * 2. [not-exists] - Checks if no nodes exist at the specified path.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the actions to execute if the condition is true.
 * 4. [remove-nodes] - Removes nodes at the specified paths if the condition is met.
