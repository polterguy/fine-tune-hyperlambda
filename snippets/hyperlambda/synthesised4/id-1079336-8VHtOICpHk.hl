/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node named "sql". This is useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically access or manipulate SQL-related data or commands stored in a node named "sql" within a complex Hyperlambda structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a SQL query or command that is stored in a node named "sql" for execution or logging.
 * - Accessing configuration or metadata related to SQL operations that are stored in a node named "sql".
