/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It starts the traversal from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds the node with this name. This is useful for pinpointing a specific section in a larger Hyperlambda structure, especially when dealing with nested nodes.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "hyper2lambda" node. It allows you to access every direct descendant of the specified node, which is helpful when you need to process or evaluate multiple nodes under a parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `.arguments` - This iterator moves to the parent node of the current result set and then retrieves the node named ".arguments". This is typically used in Hyperlambda to access the arguments passed into a function or an endpoint, as ".arguments" is a conventional node name for storing such data.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the ".arguments" node. It allows you to access each argument passed into the function or endpoint, which is crucial for processing or validating input data.
 * 
 * 5. `_user-id` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "_user-id". It is used to specifically target a node that represents a user identifier, which is often necessary for authentication or user-specific operations.
 * 
 * 6. `=string` - This iterator filters the "_user-id" nodes to only include those with a value of "string". It ensures that the user ID being processed is of the correct type or value, which is important for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to validate that a user ID passed as an argument is correctly formatted as a string. This is particularly useful in scenarios where user authentication or authorization is required, ensuring that the user ID is processed correctly before proceeding with further logic.
