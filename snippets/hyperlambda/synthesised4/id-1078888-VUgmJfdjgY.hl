/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.dp` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is useful for locating a specific node by name within the current context or its ancestors.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator retrieves the value of the node found by the previous iterator as a node by reference. It assumes that the value of the node is another node, allowing for modifications to the original node rather than a copy. This is useful when you need to work with the actual node value rather than just its data.
 * 
 * 3. `**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of its previous result set, including the node itself from where it starts, using a "breadth-first" algorithm. It is useful for accessing all nodes within a subtree, allowing for operations on a complete set of descendants.
 * 
 * 4. `\#text` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name `#text`. It is useful for extracting text nodes within a set of descendants, which can be helpful for processing or analyzing text content within a document or data structure.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include extracting and processing all text content within a specific subtree of a document, such as when parsing XML or HTML data to retrieve and manipulate text nodes for further analysis or transformation.
