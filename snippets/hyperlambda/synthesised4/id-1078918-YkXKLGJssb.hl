/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current node's context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It allows access to each individual argument passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `stream`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "stream" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically target the "stream" argument.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access a specific argument named "stream" from a list of arguments passed to a function or slot. This is useful when you need to perform operations or validations on the "stream" argument specifically.
 * - It can also be used in scenarios where you need to dynamically handle or manipulate the "stream" argument within a Hyperlambda function, such as streaming data processing or handling file streams.
