// The code uses the [strings.replace-not-of] slot to replace every character in the [.mixed] node's value that is not a digit (0-9) with an empty string, effectively removing all non-digit characters from the string. The first argument specifies the allowed characters, and the second argument specifies the replacement character, which is an empty string in this case.
