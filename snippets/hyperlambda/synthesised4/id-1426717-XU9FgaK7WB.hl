// The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expression provided in its value before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, the expression [x:+/*] is evaluated, and the resulting nodes are unwrapped, meaning their values are resolved and used in the current context before execution continues.
unwrap:x:+/*
