// 1. `@.no`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "no" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` before `no` specifies that it should look for this node in the current level or hierarchy. This iterator is useful when you want to retrieve a specific node by its name within the current scope of the Hyperlambda execution.
