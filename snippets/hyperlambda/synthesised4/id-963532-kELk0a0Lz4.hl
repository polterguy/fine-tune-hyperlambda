// The [data.delete] slot is used to delete records from a specified table in a database. It requires specifying the [database-type] and [table] from which records will be deleted. The [where] clause is used to define conditions for deletion, ensuring only specific records are removed. The [and] slot allows for multiple conditions to be combined, providing precise control over which records are targeted for deletion.
