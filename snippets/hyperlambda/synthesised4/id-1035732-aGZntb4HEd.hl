// 1. `@.src`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "src" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. It is useful when you need to access a specific node by name within the current context or hierarchy. This can be particularly helpful when you need to fetch a configuration or data node that is defined earlier in the structure and is not a direct child of the current node.
