/*
 * 1. `@.model` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "model" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, to find the node with the name "model". This is useful for accessing a specific section of the data structure that is labeled as "model".
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "model" node. It is used to access every node directly under "model", regardless of their names. This is useful when you want to perform operations on all child nodes of a particular parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `no_requests` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "no_requests". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes specifically named "no_requests" among the children of the "model" node. This is useful for accessing or modifying data related to "no_requests" within the "model" node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to count, modify, or perform operations on nodes named "no_requests" that are children of a "model" node. For instance, it could be used to check the number of requests a model has processed or to reset a counter related to requests.
