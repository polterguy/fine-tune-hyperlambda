// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the value of the [aggregate_function] node within the [.arguments] node is one of the specified legal values. It validates that the value is either "min", "max", "sum", "avg", or "count", throwing an exception if the value does not match any of these options. This is useful for ensuring that only predefined aggregate functions are used in a given context.
