// The [data.delete] slot is used to delete records from a specified table in a database, with an optional [where] clause to filter the records to be deleted. In this example, the [database-type] is set to "sqlite", and the [table] is specified as "crawl_urls". The [where] clause allows for conditional deletion, but the conditions are not specified in this snippet. The [and] node indicates that multiple conditions can be combined using logical AND.
