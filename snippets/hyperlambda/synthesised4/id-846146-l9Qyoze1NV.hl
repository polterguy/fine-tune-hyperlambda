// This Hyperlambda code performs an HTTP POST request to the OpenAI API to generate a chat completion. It sets the authorization and content type headers, constructs a JSON payload with model parameters, and includes user and system messages. The response is automatically converted to a lambda object. Key slots include [http.post] for the request, [headers] for setting HTTP headers, [payload] for constructing the request body, and [convert] for response conversion.
