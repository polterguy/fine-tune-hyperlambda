// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [not] slot to negate the result of an equality check. It uses the [eq] slot to compare the value obtained from the [get-value] slot, which retrieves the value of the [repeats] node from the [.arguments] node, against a null or empty value. The [not] slot then inverts the boolean result of this comparison, effectively checking if the [repeats] node has a non-null and non-empty value.
