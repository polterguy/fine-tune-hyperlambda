// The code snippet demonstrates how to delete a record from a specified table in a SQLite database using the [data.delete] slot. It specifies the database type as SQLite and uses a [where] clause to ensure that only records matching the given condition (where the 'id' equals a specified value) are deleted. This ensures precise deletion of records based on the condition provided.
