// This Hyperlambda code retrieves nodes based on a specific path and condition. It uses the [get-nodes] slot to return all nodes that match the expression provided. The expression navigates through the node structure starting from [.arguments], traversing its children, and filtering nodes that match the path and name specified, particularly focusing on nodes related to [comments.name.eq].
