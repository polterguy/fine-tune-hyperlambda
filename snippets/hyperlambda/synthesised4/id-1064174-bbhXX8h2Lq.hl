/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda) of its previous result set. It is useful when you want to navigate to the next node in the sequence from your current position.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access the immediate children of a node, allowing you to explore the structure beneath a particular node.
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes returned by the previous `*` iterator. This allows you to access the grandchildren of the initial node, effectively letting you explore two levels deep into the node hierarchy. 
 * 
 * This expression can be used to navigate from a node to its next sibling and then explore two levels of its descendants.
