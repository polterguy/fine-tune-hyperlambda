/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by locating the first node named "arguments" within the current context. It uses the "@" symbol to search for a node with the specified name, and the search is limited to the current node's siblings and itself. The "arguments" node is typically used to pass parameters or data into a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "arguments" node. It is used to access the nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node, allowing further filtering or processing of these nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "session" from the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target nodes that hold session-related information, which could be useful for accessing or manipulating session data within a function or slot.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - The expression could be used in a function or slot to retrieve session-related data passed as an argument, allowing the function to perform operations based on the current session state.
 * - It could be used to validate or log session information within a larger workflow, ensuring that session data is correctly handled or recorded.
