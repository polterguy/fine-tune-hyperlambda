 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name from the current context. In this case, it looks for the first node named "roles" within the current scope or hierarchy.
 * 2. `.roles` - This is the specific node name that the `@` iterator is searching for. It indicates that the expression is targeting a node named "roles". 
 * 
 * This expression is useful when you need to access or manipulate the first "roles" node in the current context, possibly to retrieve its value or perform operations on it.
