/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" from the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy if necessary.
 *    
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found in the previous step. It assumes the value of the node is another node by itself, allowing you to work with the original node rather than a copy.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous step. It is used to access the children of the node that was de-referenced.
 * 
 * 4. `images` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "images" from the children nodes obtained in the previous step.
 * 
 * 5. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "images" node(s) obtained in the previous step. It is used to access the individual image nodes contained within the "images" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve all image nodes within a specific data structure, where ".dp" is a node containing a reference to a collection of images. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or display all images associated with a particular data point.
