/*
 * 1. `@html2lambda` - This iterator starts by searching for the first node named "html2lambda" in the current context. This is typically used to locate a specific section of the Hyperlambda graph that deals with HTML to Lambda transformations.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "html2lambda" node. It is used to access any direct descendants, regardless of their names, under the "html2lambda" node.
 * 
 * 3. `html` - This iterator filters the children of the previous result set to only include nodes named "html". It is used to specifically target HTML-related nodes within the "html2lambda" context.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "html" node. It allows access to any direct descendants of the "html" node, which typically represent different parts of an HTML document.
 * 
 * 5. `body` - This iterator filters the children of the previous result set to only include nodes named "body". It is used to specifically target the body section of an HTML document.
 * 
 * 6. `**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the "body" node, including the node itself, using a breadth-first search algorithm. It is used to access any node within the body section, regardless of depth or hierarchy.
 * 
 * 7. `article` - This iterator filters the descendant nodes to only include those named "article". It is used to specifically target article elements within the body of an HTML document.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract all "article" elements from the body of an HTML document that is being processed within a Hyperlambda context. This is useful for applications that need to manipulate or analyze article content within web pages, such as content management systems or web scraping tools.
