// 1. `@.token`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "token" that is in the same level or hierarchy as the current node. The `@` symbol is used to find a node by its name, and the `.` indicates that it starts the search from the current node's level. This is useful when you need to access a specific node named "token" within the same context or parent node, such as retrieving an authentication token or a session identifier in a Hyperlambda script.
