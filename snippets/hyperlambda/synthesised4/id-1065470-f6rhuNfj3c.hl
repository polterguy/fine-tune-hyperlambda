// 1. `@.fields`: This iterator looks for the first node in the current context with the name "fields". It starts from the current node and searches upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node's siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific node named "fields" that might be located at any level above the current node in the hierarchy.
