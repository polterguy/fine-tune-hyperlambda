// 1. `@.no` - This iterator is looking for the first node with the name "no" that is an ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates it searches for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it should start the search from the current node's parent. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is hierarchically above the current node in the Hyperlambda structure.
