/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code snippet is used to perform operations on a set of nodes. It uses the [else] slot to execute a block of code if a preceding [if] condition is false. The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it is referenced, specifically targeting a deep node structure. The [add] slot is then used to insert nodes into a specified location, in this case, adding prompt and completion nodes to the [snippets] node. The [prompt] node is populated with the value from the [file-meta] node, and the [completion] node is populated with the value from the [content] node. This structure is typically used in scenarios where you need to dynamically build or modify a node structure based on certain conditions.
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes the following block if a preceding [if] condition is false.
 * 2. [unwrap] - Evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it is referenced, targeting a deep node structure.
 * 3. [add] - Inserts nodes into a specified location.
 * 4. [prompt] - Populated with the value from the [file-meta] node.
 * 5. [completion] - Populated with the value from the [content] node.
