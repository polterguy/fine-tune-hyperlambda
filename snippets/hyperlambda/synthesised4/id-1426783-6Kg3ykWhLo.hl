/*
 * This code connects to a generic or magic database to select prompts and their maximum completion values from the "ml_requests" table, filtered by a specific user ID, questionnaire, and context. It groups the results by prompt. For each selected record, it unwraps the content and adds it to a session, alternating between roles of assistant and user. The session is constructed with the prompt as the assistant's content and the completion as the user's content.
 * 
 * 1. [data.connect] - Connects to the specified database.
 * 2. [data.select] - Executes a SQL query to retrieve prompts and their maximum completion values.
 * 3. [user_id] - Filters the SQL query by user ID.
 * 4. [for-each] - Iterates over each record returned by the SQL query.
 * 5. [unwrap] - Unwraps the content of the selected record.
 * 6. [add] - Adds the unwrapped content to the session with a specified role and content.
 * 7. [role] - Specifies the role (assistant or user) for the session content.
 * 8. [content] - Specifies the content for the session based on the unwrapped data.
