/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the hierarchy from the current node's position.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node returned by the previous iterator. It is used to access every direct child node of the parent node.
 * 3. `data.create` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "data.create" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically target nodes named "data.create".
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node(s) returned by the previous iterator. It is used to access every direct child node of the "data.create" node(s).
 * 5. `values` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "values" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically target nodes named "values" under the "data.create" node(s).
