/*
 * This expression is a simple Hyperlambda expression that uses a single iterator. Let's break it down:
 * 
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name from its current context or hierarchy. In this case, it looks for the first node named "fields" in the current scope or hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access a specific node named "fields" within a Hyperlambda structure, which might contain configuration data, field definitions, or other relevant information that needs to be processed or evaluated.
