 * The code concatenates a string using [strings.concat] and assigns it to the node referenced by [set-value]. The concatenated string is "integer not null primary key autoincrement", which is typically used in SQL to define a column type with constraints.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Assigns a new value to the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into a single string.
 * 3. [.] - Represents individual string parts to be concatenated.
