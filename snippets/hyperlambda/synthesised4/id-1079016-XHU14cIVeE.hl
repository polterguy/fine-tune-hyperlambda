/*
 * 1. `@.cache-session`: This iterator searches for the first node named "cache-session" starting from the current node and traversing upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. It will return the first occurrence of a node with this name. This is useful for accessing session-related data or configurations that might be stored under a node named "cache-session".
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "cache-session" node. It is used to access all the data or settings stored within the "cache-session" node. This can be particularly useful for iterating over session variables or cached data that are stored as children nodes under "cache-session".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing all session variables stored under a "cache-session" node to perform operations like validation, logging, or updating session data.
 * - Retrieving cached data for processing or analysis, where each piece of data is stored as a child node under "cache-session".
