// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] logical operator in Hyperlambda to create a SQL WHERE clause condition. It specifies that the 'field1' column must be equal to the value 'howdy' for the condition to be true. This is achieved by appending the [.eq] equality comparison operator to the field name within the [and] block.
