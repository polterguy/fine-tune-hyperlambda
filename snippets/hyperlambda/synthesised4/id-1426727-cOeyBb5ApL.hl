// This code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the Hyperlambda type name of a specified value. In this example, a node named [.foo] is declared with an integer value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to determine the type of the value associated with the [.foo] node. The result of the [type] invocation will be the type name of the value, which is "int" in this case. The [type] slot is useful for dynamically checking and verifying the data types of values within a Hyperlambda script.
