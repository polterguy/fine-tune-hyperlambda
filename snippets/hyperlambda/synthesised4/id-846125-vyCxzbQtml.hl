/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a loop that continues executing as long as the value of [.tmp] is more than 0. Within each iteration, it removes the first node from [.cache-session] and decrements the value of [.tmp] by 1. 
 * 
 * 1. [while] - Initiates a loop that continues as long as the condition is true.
 * 2. [mt] - Checks if the value of [.tmp] is more than 0.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the operations to be executed in each iteration of the loop.
 * 4. [remove-nodes] - Removes the first node from [.cache-session].
 * 5. [math.decrement] - Decreases the value of [.tmp] by 1.
