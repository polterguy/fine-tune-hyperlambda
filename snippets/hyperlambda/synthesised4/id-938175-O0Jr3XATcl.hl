// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [zone] node is equal to "A". If this condition is true, it sets the value of the [orderStatus] node to "Priority shipping". The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, where the [eq] slot checks for equality between the [zone] node's value and "A". If the condition is met, the [.lambda] node executes the [set-value] slot to update the [orderStatus] node.
