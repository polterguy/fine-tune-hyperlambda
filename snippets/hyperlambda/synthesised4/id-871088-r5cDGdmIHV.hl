/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the first URL node under the execute node does not exist using [not] and [exists]. If the condition is true, it removes the entire urls node using [remove-nodes]. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Starts a conditional block.
 * 2. [not] - Inverts the result of the condition.
 * 3. [exists] - Checks if the first URL node under execute exists.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 5. [remove-nodes] - Removes the urls node if the condition is met.
