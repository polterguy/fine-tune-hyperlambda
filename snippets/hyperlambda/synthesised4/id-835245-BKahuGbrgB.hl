// The Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate an expression that retrieves the value of a node located at a specific path. The path expression `./*/signal/*/url` navigates through the current node's children to find a node named [url] under a [signal] node. The [unwrap] slot ensures that this value is evaluated and made available for further processing.
unwrap:x:./*/signal/*/url
