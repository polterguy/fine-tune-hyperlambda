// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type name of a node's value. The example initializes a node [.foo] with an integer value and uses [type] to obtain its type. The [type] slot is crucial for understanding the data type of a node's value, which can be useful for validation or conversion purposes. The code highlights the importance of type declarations in Hyperlambda, which are placed between a node's name and its value, separated by a colon.
