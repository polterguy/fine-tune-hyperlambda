// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each role provided in the [.arguments] node and deletes corresponding entries from the "users_roles" table where the username and role match. The [for-each] slot iterates through roles, and [data.delete] removes entries based on conditions specified in the [where] clause, ensuring only relevant records are deleted.
