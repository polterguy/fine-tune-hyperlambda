/*
 * 1. `@.seed`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "seed" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node named "seed" that is an ancestor or a sibling of the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or initialization data stored in a "seed" node that is shared across multiple parts of a Hyperlambda script.
 * - Retrieving a value from a "seed" node that acts as a template or default setting for subsequent operations.
