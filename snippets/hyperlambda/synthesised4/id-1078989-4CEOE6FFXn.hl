/*
 * 1. `@.first`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "first" from the current node's hierarchy. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy to find the first occurrence of a node named "first". This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located higher up in the hierarchy, such as a configuration or a setting node that applies to multiple sibling nodes. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a common configuration or setting node that is shared across multiple sibling nodes.
 * - Retrieving a parent node's property or value that is relevant to the current node's processing logic.
