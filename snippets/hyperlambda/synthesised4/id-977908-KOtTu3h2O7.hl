/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if both [token-valid] and [password-valid] are true using the [and] slot. If either is false, the [not] slot negates the result, triggering the [if] condition to execute its lambda, setting [security-ok] to false. This ensures that security is only considered okay if both conditions are met. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if the condition is true to execute the lambda.
 * 2. [not] - Negates the result of the [and] condition.
 * 3. [and] - Evaluates if both [token-valid] and [password-valid] are true.
 * 4. [get-value:x:@.token-valid] - Retrieves the value of [token-valid].
 * 5. [get-value:x:@.password-valid] - Retrieves the value of [password-valid].
 * 6. [.lambda] - Contains the actions to execute if the condition is true.
 * 7. [set-value:x:@.security-ok] - Sets the value of [security-ok] to false.
