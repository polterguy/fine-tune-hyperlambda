// The code snippet uses the [or] slot to evaluate two conditions: whether the value of the [verb] node within the current [.dp] node is "get" or "delete". If either condition is true, the [or] slot will evaluate to true. The [eq] slots are used to compare the value of the [verb] node against the specified strings.
