// This Hyperlambda code snippet connects to a SQLite database and reads from the "questionnaires" table. It selects the count of all rows in the table, naming the result as "count". The [where] clause is present but not specified, and the [limit] is set to 1, meaning only one result will be returned. The [database-type] specifies the database being used.
