// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [fork] slot to execute a lambda asynchronously in a separate thread. It first pauses execution for 500 milliseconds using the [sleep] slot, and then logs a message "First async log" with [log.info]. This allows the main thread to continue executing without waiting for the completion of the forked task.

   sleep:500
