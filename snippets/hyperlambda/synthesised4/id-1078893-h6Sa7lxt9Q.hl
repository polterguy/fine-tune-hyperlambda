/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (the next node below it in the Hyperlambda) of the current node. It is useful when you want to move downwards in the hierarchy to access the next sibling node.
 * 
 * 2. `+` - This second `+` iterator again retrieves the elder sibling of the current node, effectively moving two nodes downwards in the hierarchy. This can be useful for skipping over nodes or accessing a specific sibling node further down.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access the children of the current node, allowing you to work with multiple nodes at once.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes returned by the previous `*` iterator. It allows for deeper traversal into the hierarchy to access nested children nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `*` - This third `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes returned by the previous `*` iterator, allowing for even deeper traversal into the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to navigate a complex hierarchical structure where you need to access deeply nested nodes that are siblings of a particular node, such as when processing a deeply nested XML or JSON structure in Hyperlambda.
