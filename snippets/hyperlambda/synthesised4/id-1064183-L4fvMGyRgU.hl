/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to access the [.arguments] node, which typically contains input parameters or arguments for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected [.arguments] node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `direction` - This iterator filters the previously selected nodes to only include those with the name "direction". It is used to specifically access the "direction" argument, assuming it is a child of the [.arguments] node. 
 * 
 * This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to access a specific argument, "direction", from a set of input parameters provided to a function or endpoint.
