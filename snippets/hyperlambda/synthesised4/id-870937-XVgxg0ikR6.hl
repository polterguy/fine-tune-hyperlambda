/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert nodes into a specified location within a node graph. It adds a new node structure with [name] and [type] as children under the path specified by the expression in [add]. The expression targets the [args] node, which is a child of [return-nodes], allowing for dynamic extension of the node structure. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts nodes at the specified location in the node graph.
 * 2. [name] - Represents a child node under the newly added structure.
 * 3. [type] - Represents another child node under the newly added structure.
