// This Hyperlambda code executes a workflow action named "markdown2html" using the [execute] slot. It specifies the filename of the action and passes in an argument named "markdown", which is derived from the content of a node using a lambda expression. The expression retrieves and HTML encodes the body content, ensuring the markdown is processed correctly.
