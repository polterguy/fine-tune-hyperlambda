/*
 * 1. `@json2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named "json2lambda" in the current context. It starts the traversal from the root or the current node, depending on the context in which it is used. This node is assumed to be the starting point for further navigation.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "json2lambda" node. It allows the traversal to continue deeper into the hierarchy by accessing each child node under "json2lambda".
 * 
 * 3. `message` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find those specifically named "message". It narrows down the node set to only those nodes that match the name "message".
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Once again, this iterator retrieves all children of the "message" nodes. It allows further traversal into the hierarchy to access the next level of nodes under each "message" node.
 * 
 * 5. `content` - Finally, this iterator filters the children of the "message" nodes to find nodes named "content". It selects only those nodes that match the name "content", providing access to their values or further children.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to extract specific content from a JSON-like structure that has been converted into a Hyperlambda node structure. For example, if you have a JSON object with messages and each message contains content, this expression would allow you to access the content of each message.
 * - It could be useful in a logging or messaging system where you need to process or display the content of messages stored in a structured format.
