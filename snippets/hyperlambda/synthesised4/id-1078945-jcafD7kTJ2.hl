/*
 * 1. `@.fixed`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "fixed" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - To retrieve a configuration or constant value stored in a parent node named "fixed".
 * - To access a specific setting or parameter that is defined at a higher level in the node hierarchy, ensuring that the value is consistently used across different parts of the Hyperlambda code.
