// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [fork] slot to asynchronously execute an HTTP GET request to the specified URL. The [fork] slot allows for concurrent execution, enabling the HTTP request to be processed in parallel with other operations. The [http.get] slot retrieves data from the given endpoint, allowing for efficient multitasking in Hyperlambda.
