/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet appends the JSON representation of a lambda object to an existing result node, followed by a newline character. It uses the [set-value] slot to update the value of the [.function-result] node by concatenating its current value with the output of [lambda2json] and a newline. The [strings.concat] slot is used to perform the concatenation, and [get-value] is used to retrieve the current values of [.function-result] and [lambda2json]. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the [.function-result] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.function-result] - Retrieves the current value of the [.function-result] node.
 * 4. [get-value:x:@lambda2json] - Retrieves the JSON representation of a lambda object.
 * 5. [.: "\n"] - Represents a newline character to be appended at the end.
