// This code changes the name of nodes referenced by its expression to a concatenated string. The [set-name] slot targets nodes using a complex expression, and the [strings.concat] slot combines a static string and a value retrieved from another node to form the new name. The process involves the following steps: 1. [set-name] changes the name of nodes found by the expression. 2. [strings.concat] creates the new name by concatenating a static string and a dynamic value. 3. [get-value] retrieves the current value of a node to be used in the concatenation.
