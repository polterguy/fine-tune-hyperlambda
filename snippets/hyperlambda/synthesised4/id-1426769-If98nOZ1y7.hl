// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, it evaluates the expression [x:+/*/*], which navigates to the node's elder sibling, retrieves all its children, and then all their children, effectively "unwrapping" these nodes into the current context.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
