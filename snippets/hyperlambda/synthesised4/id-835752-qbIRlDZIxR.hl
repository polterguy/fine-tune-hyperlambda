/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to the result of a [data.connect] operation. It retrieves nodes using [get-nodes] from the [.arguments] node, specifically targeting [limit] and [offset] arguments, which are typically used for pagination purposes. The [add] slot then appends these nodes to the result of the [data.connect] operation, allowing for dynamic modification of the data retrieval process based on the provided arguments. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the result of a data connection operation.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node, specifically [limit] and [offset] for pagination.
