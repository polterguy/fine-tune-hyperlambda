/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is commonly used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument node individually.
 * 
 * 3. `css`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "css". It is used to specifically target the "css" argument within the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve the value of a "css" argument passed to a Hyperlambda function or slot, allowing the developer to apply or manipulate CSS styles based on the provided argument.
