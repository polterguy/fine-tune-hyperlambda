// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the first child node of the result produced by the [strings.split] operation. The [get-value] slot is used to access the value of the node specified by the expression, which in this case is the first node resulting from the [strings.split] operation. The expression `@strings.split/0/-` navigates to the first child node of [strings.split] and retrieves its value.
