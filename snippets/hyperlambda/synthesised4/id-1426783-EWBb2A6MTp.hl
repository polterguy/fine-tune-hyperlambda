/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet retrieves the second element from a split string operation and assigns it to a node. It uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.from] node to the result of a [get-value] operation, which extracts the second element from a previously split string stored in [strings.split]. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node referenced by the expression to the value obtained from its child node.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression, in this case, the second element from the [strings.split] node.
