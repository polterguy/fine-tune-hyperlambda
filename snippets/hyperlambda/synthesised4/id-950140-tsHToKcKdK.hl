/*
 * This Hyperlambda code creates a dynamic slot named "magic.auth.ensure-role" that ensures a specified role exists in a database. It first validates the presence of "role" and "description" arguments using [validators.mandatory]. It then attempts to connect to a database and read from the "roles" table to check if the role already exists. If the role does not exist, it inserts a new record into the "roles" table with the provided role name and description. Any exceptions during this process are caught and silenced. 
 * 
 * 1. [slots.create] - Creates a new dynamic slot named "magic.auth.ensure-role".
 * 2. [validators.mandatory] - Ensures the "role" and "description" arguments are provided.
 * 3. [try] - Begins a block to attempt database operations.
 * 4. [data.connect] - Connects to a database.
 * 5. [data.read] - Reads from the "roles" table to check for the existence of the role.
 * 6. [if] - Checks if the role does not exist in the database.
 * 7. [not] - Negates the condition to check for non-existence.
 * 8. [exists] - Determines if the role was found in the database read operation.
 * 9. [data.create] - Inserts a new role into the "roles" table if it doesn't exist.
 * 10. [.catch] - Catches any exceptions that occur during the try block.
 * 11. [.silent] - Silences any exceptions caught, preventing them from propagating.
