/*
 * 1. `@config.get`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "config.get" from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its siblings and ancestors until it finds a match. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to access configuration settings stored in a node named "config.get" within a Hyperlambda application. 
 * - It might be used to dynamically retrieve configuration values needed for further processing or decision-making in the application logic.
