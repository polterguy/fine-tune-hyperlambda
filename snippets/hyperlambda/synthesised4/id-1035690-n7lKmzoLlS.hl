/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot, especially in the context of HTTP endpoints or dynamic slots.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are children of the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `country` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named [country]. It is used to specifically access the [country] argument node among the children of the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * This expression is commonly used to access the value of a specific argument, in this case, [country], that is passed to a function or endpoint. It is useful in scenarios where you need to process or validate input data based on specific arguments.
