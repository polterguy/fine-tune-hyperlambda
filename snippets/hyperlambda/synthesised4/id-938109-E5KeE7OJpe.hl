// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a loop that continues to execute as long as the value of [.stock] is less than 5. During each iteration, it adds a node with the text "Restocking item" to [.warehouse] and increments the [.stock] value by 1. The loop effectively simulates a restocking process until the stock reaches a specified limit.
