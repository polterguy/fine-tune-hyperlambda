// This code snippet connects to the "sakila" database and initiates a database transaction. Within this transaction, it attempts to execute a SQL delete operation on the "film_actor" table. However, since the transaction is not explicitly committed, it will automatically roll back upon exiting the scope, ensuring no changes are made to the database.
data.connect:sakila
   data.transaction.create
