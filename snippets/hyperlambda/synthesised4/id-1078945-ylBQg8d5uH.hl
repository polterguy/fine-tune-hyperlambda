/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves downwards in the node hierarchy to the next node at the same level. This is useful when you want to access the next sibling node in a sequence of nodes.
 * 
 * 2. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access every child node directly under the current node, allowing you to perform operations or evaluations on each child node.
 * 
 * 3. `/*` - This is a repetition of the previous iterator, which again retrieves all children nodes of the current node. This is useful when you want to access the children of the children nodes retrieved by the first `/*` iterator, effectively allowing you to traverse two levels down from the elder sibling node.
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression might include scenarios where you need to process or evaluate nodes that are two levels deep under the next sibling node in a hierarchical data structure, such as extracting specific data points from a nested configuration or settings file.
