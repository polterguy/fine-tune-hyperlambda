// 1. `-`: This iterator retrieves the younger sibling of the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. The younger sibling is the node that appears immediately before the current node in the sequence. This iterator is useful when you need to access or manipulate the node that is directly preceding the current node in the hierarchy. It is often used in scenarios where the relationship or order between nodes is significant, such as when processing sequential data or maintaining a specific order of operations.
