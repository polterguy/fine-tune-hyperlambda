/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [strings.split] slot to split the content of an HTTP GET request response into multiple strings, using the newline character ("\n") as the delimiter. The slot takes as input the content retrieved from the HTTP GET request and returns a node set where each node represents a segment of the original content that was separated by newline characters. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.split] - Splits a string into multiple parts based on a specified delimiter.
 * 2. [x:@http.get/*/content] - The expression pointing to the content of the HTTP GET request response.
 * 3. [.] - The delimiter used for splitting, in this case, a newline character ("\n").
