// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specific location within a node graph. It targets nodes resulting from a [data.connect] invocation, specifically within the [yield] section, and appends a new node under [rag_functions]. The appended node contains a value extracted from the [prompt] node of the currently iterated node, using a reference to [.dp]. This approach allows for dynamic modification of the node structure based on database connection results.
