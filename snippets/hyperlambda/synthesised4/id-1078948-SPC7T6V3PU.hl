/*
 * 1. `@.model` - This iterator searches for the first ancestor node with the name "model". It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access a node that is a parent or ancestor of the current node, ensuring that you are referencing the correct part of the structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "model" node. It is used to access every child node directly under the "model" node, regardless of their names. This is helpful when you want to perform operations on all children nodes or when you need to find a specific node among them.
 * 
 * 3. `webhook_incoming_url` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "webhook_incoming_url". After retrieving all children of the "model" node, this step narrows down the selection to only those nodes named "webhook_incoming_url". This is useful when you are specifically interested in nodes with this name, perhaps to retrieve or modify their values.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve the "webhook_incoming_url" node from a model configuration, which might be necessary for setting up or testing webhook integrations.
 * - It can also be used in a script to verify or log the incoming webhook URL for debugging or auditing purposes.
