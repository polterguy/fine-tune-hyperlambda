/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot in Hyperlambda to update the value of all nodes referenced by its expression. In this example, it changes the value of all [h4] nodes that are children of the [.page-header] node to the value of the [.prompt] node. This is achieved by using the [get-value] slot to retrieve the value of [.prompt] and passing it as the source to [set-value].
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the nodes referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [.prompt] node to be used as the new value for the [h4] nodes.
