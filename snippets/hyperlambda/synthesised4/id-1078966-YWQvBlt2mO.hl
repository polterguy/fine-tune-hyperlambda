/*
 * 1. `@.html`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "html" starting from the current node's context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, and the `.` before it means it starts the search from the current node's context. 
 * 
 * The use case for this expression could be to retrieve or manipulate the "html" node within a Hyperlambda structure, possibly to modify its content or to perform some operation based on its value or children. This is useful in scenarios where you are working with HTML content in a Hyperlambda-based application or script.
