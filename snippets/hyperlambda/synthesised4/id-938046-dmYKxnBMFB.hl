// This Hyperlambda code snippet updates the value of the [.modified] node by adding a specific time duration to the [.timestamp] node. It uses [math.add] to sum the current timestamp with a time span of 2 hours and 45 minutes, created by two separate [time] slots. The [set-value] slot then assigns this new calculated time to [.modified].
