/*
 * 1. `@data.connect`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "data.connect" from the current context. It starts the expression by locating this specific node within the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "data.connect" node. It allows access to all direct descendants of "data.connect".
 * 
 * 3. `data.read`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find those with the name "data.read". It focuses on nodes named "data.read" among the children of "data.connect".
 * 
 * 4. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "data.read" nodes. It allows access to all direct descendants of each "data.read" node.
 * 
 * 5. `group`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find those with the name "group". It focuses on nodes named "group" among the children of "data.read".
 * 
 * 6. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "group" nodes. It allows access to all direct descendants of each "group" node.
 * 
 * 7. `group_column`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find those with the name "group_column". It focuses on nodes named "group_column" among the children of "group". 
 * 
 * This expression is useful for navigating a hierarchical data structure to locate specific nodes, such as "group_column", that are nested within a series of parent nodes. It can be used in scenarios where data is organized in a nested manner, and specific elements need to be accessed or manipulated.
