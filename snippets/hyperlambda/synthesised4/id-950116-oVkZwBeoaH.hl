// This Hyperlambda code uses the [add] slot to append nodes from two different sources into a destination node. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all child nodes of [.input1] and [.input2], and these nodes are then added to the [.output] node's children collection. This operation effectively merges the nodes from [.input1] and [.input2] into [.output].
