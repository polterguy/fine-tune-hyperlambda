/*
 * The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type name of a node's value. In this example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer value of 57. The [type] slot is then used with an expression pointing to the previous node to return the type name of the value, which is "int". This allows you to dynamically determine the data type of a node's value within your Hyperlambda code.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type name of the previous node's value, which is "int".
