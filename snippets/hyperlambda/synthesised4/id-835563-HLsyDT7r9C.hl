// This Hyperlambda code concatenates strings to form a SQL query. It uses [set-value] to update the [.sql] node by appending additional strings to its current value using [strings.concat]. The concatenated strings include a table name "CustomerCustomerDemo" and a condition "where keyword_count > 0". The [get-value] retrieves the current value of [.sql] to ensure the new strings are appended to the existing SQL statement.
