// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join operation between two tables, "leads" and "clients", using the "client_id" as the alias for the "clients" table. The join condition is specified using an "and" logical condition to match the "client_id" from the "leads" table with the "client_id" from the "clients" table. The [join] slot is used to define the join operation, while the [as] slot is used to alias the "clients" table.
