/*
 * This code snippet uses an [if] statement to check a condition involving an [or] logical operation. It evaluates whether the [auth] node within the current [.dp] node is null or has an empty value using [null] and [eq] slots. If either condition is true, it executes a lambda object that adds the current [.dp] node to the [models] node using the [add] and [get-nodes] slots. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves nodes referenced by its expression, and the [add] slot appends these nodes to the specified target node.
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Evaluates a condition and executes its lambda object if true.
 * 2. [or] - Combines two conditions, returning true if either is true.
 * 3. [null] - Checks if the [auth] node is null.
 * 4. [eq] - Compares the [auth] node to an empty value.
 * 5. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the [if] condition is true.
 * 6. [add] - Appends nodes to the [models] node.
 * 7. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes referenced by the expression.
