// The code iterates over each node in the [signal] collection and checks multiple conditions for each node. If the node does not exist in the [done] or [urls] collections and its value starts with the specified URL, the node is added to the [urls] collection. The [for-each] slot iterates through nodes, [if] checks conditions, [and] combines conditions, [not-exists] checks for non-existence, [strings.starts-with] checks the start of a string, and [add] appends nodes to a collection.
