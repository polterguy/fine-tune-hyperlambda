/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [case] slot within a [switch] statement to perform conditional execution based on an unsigned integer value. The [switch] slot evaluates the value of the specified node and executes the first matching [case] node as a lambda object. The [case] nodes must have a value, either a constant or an expression, and the [default] node is optional, providing a fallback if no [case] matches. The example illustrates using unsigned integers as values for [case] nodes.
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Represents a branch in a [switch] statement, executed if its value matches the evaluated value of the [switch] node.
