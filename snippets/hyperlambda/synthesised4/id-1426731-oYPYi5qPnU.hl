// The code demonstrates the use of the [return-nodes] slot to return a set of nodes from a dynamically created slot or a context that supports returning nodes. In this example, it returns a single node named [has-sitemap] with a boolean value of false. This allows the caller to receive a structured response containing multiple nodes, potentially representing a more complex data structure.
