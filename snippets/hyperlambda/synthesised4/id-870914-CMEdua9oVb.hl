// This Hyperlambda code retrieves a subset of nodes from a specified node collection. The [get-nodes] slot is used with an expression that targets the first node within the children of the [.arguments] node. The expression [0,1] specifies that only the first node in the collection should be returned. This is useful for selectively accessing specific nodes in a larger node set.
