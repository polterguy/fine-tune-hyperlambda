// The code uses the [execute] slot to invoke the [magic.io.file.load-recursively] slot, which loads all files recursively within the specified folder at "/modules/fine-tune-hyperlambda/snippets/". This operation returns the filenames and their content, making it useful for tasks like generating frontend applications based on templates or downloading a folder. The result is an array of filenames, each with a child node containing the file's content.
