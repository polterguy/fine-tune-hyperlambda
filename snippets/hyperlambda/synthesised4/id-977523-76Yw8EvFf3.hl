// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [case] slot to check if a given integer value is 20, and if so, it sets the value of the [.result] node to the string "Value is twenty". The [case] slot is typically used within a [switch] construct to handle specific cases, but here it directly evaluates the condition.
case:int:20
   set-value:x:@.result
      .:Value is twenty
