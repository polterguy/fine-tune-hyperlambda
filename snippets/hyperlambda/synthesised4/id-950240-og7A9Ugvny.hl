// The code retrieves the value of a specific node within a referenced node structure. It uses the [get-value] slot to access the value of a node identified by the expression [x:@.dp/#/*/with]. This expression navigates through a node graph, starting from a reference node [.dp], accessing its value, and further traversing its children to find a node named "with". The [get-value] slot then returns the value of this "with" node.
