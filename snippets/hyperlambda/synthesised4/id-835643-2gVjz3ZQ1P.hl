// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to update records in a SQLite database using the [data.update] slot. It specifies the database type as SQLite and targets the "Regions" table. The [values] node is intended to contain the columns and their new values for the update operation. The [where] node, with its [and] condition, is used to define the criteria for selecting the records to update, ensuring that only specific records are modified.
