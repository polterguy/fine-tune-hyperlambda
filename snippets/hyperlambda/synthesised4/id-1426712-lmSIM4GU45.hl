// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node it references is reached, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions. The expression "x:+/*/*" will be evaluated, and its result will be unwrapped, effectively resolving any references or expressions before proceeding to the next node.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
