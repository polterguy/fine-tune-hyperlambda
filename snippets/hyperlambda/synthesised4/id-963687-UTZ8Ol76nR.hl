// The Hyperlambda code uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the node referenced by [.dp] to "hidden@example.com". The [.dp] node is typically used in iterations or dynamic slots to refer to the current node being processed, and the [#] iterator allows for direct modification of the node's value by reference.
