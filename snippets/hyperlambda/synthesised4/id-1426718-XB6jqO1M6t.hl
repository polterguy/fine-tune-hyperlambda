// The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expression provided in its value before the node where it's referenced is reached, effectively "unwrapping" the expression. In this example, the expression `x:+/*/*/*` is evaluated, and its result is used as the value of the node where [unwrap] is invoked. This allows for dynamic evaluation and assignment of values in Hyperlambda.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*
