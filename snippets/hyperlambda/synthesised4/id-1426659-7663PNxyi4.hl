/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if certain conditions are met for nodes within a data structure, specifically looking for the existence and non-null status of "prompt" and "completion" nodes. If these conditions are true, it trims any whitespace from the values of these nodes and adds the modified node to a return collection. The code is useful for ensuring that the "prompt" and "completion" nodes contain valid, non-empty strings, and for preparing these nodes for further processing or return.
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional block that will execute its lambda object if the condition is true.
 * 2. [and] - Combines multiple conditions that must all be true for the block to execute.
 * 3. [exists] - Checks if the "prompt" node exists in the data structure.
 * 4. [not-null] - Ensures the "prompt" node is not null.
 * 5. [mt] - Checks if the length of the "prompt" string is greater than 0.
 * 6. [exists] - Checks if the "completion" node exists in the data structure.
 * 7. [not-null] - Ensures the "completion" node is not null.
 * 8. [.lambda] - Contains the actions to execute if the conditions are met.
 * 9. [set-value] - Sets a new value for the "prompt" node, trimming whitespace.
 * 10. [strings.trim] - Trims whitespace from the "prompt" node's value.
 * 11. [set-value] - Sets a new value for the "completion" node, trimming whitespace.
 * 12. [strings.trim] - Trims whitespace from the "completion" node's value.
 * 13. [add] - Adds the modified node to a return collection.
 * 14. [get-nodes] - Retrieves the nodes to be added to the return collection.
