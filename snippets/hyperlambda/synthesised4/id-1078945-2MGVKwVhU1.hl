/*
 * 1. `@.tmp-completion`: This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "tmp-completion" in the current node's hierarchy. It starts from the current node and looks upwards through the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that may not be a direct child of the current node, but exists somewhere in the ancestor hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or state information stored in a node named "tmp-completion" that is shared across different parts of the Hyperlambda graph.
 * - Retrieving a temporary result or intermediate computation stored in a "tmp-completion" node that needs to be used in subsequent operations.
