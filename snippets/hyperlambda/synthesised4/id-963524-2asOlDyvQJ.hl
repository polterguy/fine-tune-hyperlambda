// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of [.status] is not equal to "Ready". If the condition is true, it logs an informational message indicating that [.status] is not "Ready". The [neq] slot is used to compare the [.status] value against "Ready", and if they are not equal, the [.lambda] block is executed to perform the logging action.
