/*
 * 1. `@.session` - This iterator searches for the first node named "session" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "session" node it encounters.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "session" node found by the previous iterator.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access all session-related data stored as children nodes under a "session" node, which might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or validate session information in a web application.
