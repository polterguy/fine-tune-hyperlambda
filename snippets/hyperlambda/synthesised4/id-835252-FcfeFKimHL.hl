// This Hyperlambda code checks if any nodes exist under [data.select]. If no nodes are found, it executes a lambda object that removes all nodes located at the path [../*/return/*/snippets]. The [if] slot is used to evaluate the condition, and [not-exists] checks for the absence of nodes, while [remove-nodes] deletes the specified nodes if the condition is true.
