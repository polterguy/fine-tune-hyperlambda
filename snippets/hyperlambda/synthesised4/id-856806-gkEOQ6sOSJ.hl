// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node. Specifically, it sets the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.first] to a boolean value of false. The [set-value] slot takes an expression pointing to the target node and a child node containing the new value to be assigned.
set-value:x:@.first
