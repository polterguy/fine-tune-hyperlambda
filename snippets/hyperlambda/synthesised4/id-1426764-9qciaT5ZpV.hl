 * /*
 *  * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement with a [case] slot to handle different conditions based on the value of the [dataType] node.
 *  * The [switch] slot evaluates the value of [dataType] and executes the corresponding [case] block if a match is found.
 *  * If no match is found, the [default] block is executed.
 *  * This structure is useful for handling multiple conditional branches based on a single variable's value.
 *  *
 *  * 1. [dataType] - A node representing the type of data being evaluated.
 *  * 2. [switch] - A slot that evaluates the value of [dataType] to determine which [case] block to execute.
 *  * 3. [case] - A slot that specifies a condition to match against the value of [dataType].
 *  * 4. [default] - A block that executes if no [case] conditions match the value of [dataType].
