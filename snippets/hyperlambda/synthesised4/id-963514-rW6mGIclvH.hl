// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a "customer" table in a database. It uses the [data.read] slot to execute a SQL SELECT statement, limiting the result set to 5 records. The [table] slot specifies the table to query, and the [limit] slot restricts the number of records returned to prevent excessive data retrieval.
data.read
   table:customer
   limit:5
