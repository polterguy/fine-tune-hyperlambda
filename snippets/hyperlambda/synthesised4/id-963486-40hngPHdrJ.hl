// This Hyperlambda code uses the [for-each] slot to iterate over each role provided in the [.arguments] node. For each role, it creates a new entry in the "users_roles" table using the [data.create] slot, setting the role and username as values for the new record. The [.dp] node is used to reference the current role being iterated.
