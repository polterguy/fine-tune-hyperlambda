/*
 * 1. `@http.post` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "http.post" from the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further navigation within the node structure. This is useful when you need to access a specific section of a Hyperlambda graph that deals with HTTP POST requests.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the previously selected "http.post" node. It allows you to explore all the elements contained within the HTTP POST node, which could include headers, body, or other related information.
 * 
 * 3. `content` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to find those with the name "content". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes specifically related to the content of the HTTP POST request, which might include the payload or data being sent.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the previously selected "content" node. It is used to access all elements within the content node, which could include various parts of the data structure being sent in the HTTP request.
 * 
 * 5. `name` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to find those with the name "name". It is used to specifically access nodes that hold the name information within the content of the HTTP POST request, which might be used for identifying or processing the data.
