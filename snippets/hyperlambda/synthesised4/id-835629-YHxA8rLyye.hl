/*
 * The Hyperlambda code changes the name of a node using the [set-name] slot. It concatenates a string using [strings.concat], combining a static string value and the value of a node referenced by a lambda expression. The resulting concatenated string is used as the new name for the node.
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the name of the node(s) referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 3. [.] - Represents a static string value.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a node specified by its expression.
