/*
 * 1. `@.buffer`: This iterator searches for the first node named "buffer" starting from the current node and traversing upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. It is useful for locating a specific node that may not be a direct child of the current node but exists somewhere in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "buffer" node. It allows for accessing all immediate descendants of the "buffer" node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `url`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "url" from the children of the "buffer" node. It is used to specifically target nodes with the name "url" among the children of the "buffer" node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to extract URLs from a buffer node, which might be part of a larger data structure where URLs are stored for further processing, such as downloading resources or redirecting users.
