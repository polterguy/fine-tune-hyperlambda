/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert a node structure into a specific location within a Hyperlambda graph. The [add] slot is used to add new nodes to an existing node set. In this example, the [add] slot targets a specific location in the graph, defined by the expression `x:@.exe/*/signal`, and adds a new node structure with three children nodes: [to], [from], and [channel]. Each of these nodes has an expression pointing to another node in the graph, allowing for dynamic value assignment. This pattern is useful for dynamically constructing or modifying node graphs based on existing data within the graph.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node structure to the specified location in the graph.
 * 2. [to] - A child node of the added structure, with its value dynamically set from another node.
 * 3. [from] - A child node of the added structure, with its value dynamically set from another node.
 * 4. [channel] - A child node of the added structure, with its value dynamically set from another node.
