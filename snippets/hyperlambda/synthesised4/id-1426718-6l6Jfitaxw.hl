/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the HTTP status code returned by an [http.post] request is less than 300, indicating a successful response (status codes below 300 generally indicate success in HTTP). If the condition is true, it implies the HTTP POST request was successful. 
 * 
 * 1. [lt] - Compares the value of the node specified in its expression to the value of its child node to determine if it is less than the child node's value.
 * 2. [http.post] - Represents the HTTP POST request whose status code is being checked.
 * 3. [.] - Contains the integer value 300, which is the threshold for determining if the HTTP status code indicates success.
