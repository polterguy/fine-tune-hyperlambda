/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "hyper2lambda" from the current context. It is useful when you need to access a specific node by its name, especially when it is not a direct child of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "hyper2lambda" node. It is useful for accessing or iterating over all child nodes when you need to perform operations on each of them or extract specific information.
 * 
 * 3. `payload` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "payload" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used when you are interested in nodes with a specific name among the children, allowing you to focus on relevant data.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - Extracting or processing data contained within "payload" nodes under a "hyper2lambda" node, such as when dealing with a data structure where "payload" nodes hold important information.
 * - Iterating over multiple "payload" nodes to perform batch operations or aggregations, such as summing values or collecting data for reporting.
