// This Hyperlambda code performs a logical AND operation to check if the HTTP status code returned by a previous [http.get] request is between 200 and 299 inclusive. The [mte] slot checks if the status code is more than or equal to 200, and the [lt] slot checks if it is less than 300. If both conditions are true, the overall expression evaluates to true.
