/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda. This is useful when you need to work with or validate input parameters in a dynamic slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument passed to the slot or function. This is useful for iterating over or processing multiple arguments.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "session". It is used to specifically target the "session" argument within the list of arguments. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate a specific argument by name.
