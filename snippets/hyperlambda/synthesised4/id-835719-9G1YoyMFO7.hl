// This Hyperlambda code snippet establishes a connection to an SQLite database and reads data from the "notes" table. It performs a left join with the "clients" table using the "client_id" as an alias, selecting specific columns from both tables, and applies a "where" condition to filter the results. The [database-type] specifies the database, [table] and [join] define the tables and join type, [columns] lists the selected columns, and [where] sets up the filtering condition.
