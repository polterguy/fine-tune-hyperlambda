// The code checks if the value of the [status] node is not equal to "complete". If this condition is true, it sets the value of the [action-required] node to boolean true. This is achieved using the [if] slot to evaluate the condition, the [neq] slot to compare the [status] node's value, and the [set-value] slot to update the [action-required] node.
