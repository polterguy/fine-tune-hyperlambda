// The [unwrap] slot evaluates an expression before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, it unwraps the value of a node located at a specific path, which traverses multiple levels of hierarchy to access a node named "content". The result is that the value of the "content" node is evaluated and used before the [unwrap] node is executed.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*/content
