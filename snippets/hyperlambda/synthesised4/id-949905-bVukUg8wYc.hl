// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a conditional check using the [if] slot combined with the [neq] slot to evaluate if the value of the [index] node is not equal to 0. If the condition is true, the code within the [.lambda] node will be executed. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [index] node for comparison.
