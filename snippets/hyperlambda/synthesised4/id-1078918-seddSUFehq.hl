/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. The `@` symbol is used to find the first node with the specified name, which is `.arguments` in this case. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. The `*` symbol is used to access all direct children of the node found by the previous iterator. This is useful for iterating over or accessing all argument nodes provided to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `markdown` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `markdown`. It selects nodes from the children of `.arguments` that have the specific name `markdown`. This is often used to access a specific argument or parameter by name.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function or slot to access a specific argument named `markdown` that has been passed to the function. This might be useful in a scenario where you need to process or manipulate markdown content provided as an argument.
