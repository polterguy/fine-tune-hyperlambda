// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to convert the value of a node to a specified type and set it back. It uses [set-value] to change the value of the node referenced by [.dp], applying [convert] to transform the node's value to the type specified in the [.action] node's [.arguments]. The [type] is dynamically determined using [get-name] to extract the type from the [.arguments] structure.
