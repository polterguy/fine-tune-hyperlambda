// This Hyperlambda code connects to a PostgreSQL database named "accounts" and deletes a record from the "users" table where the "id" field equals 1001. The [pgsql.connect] slot establishes the database connection, while the [pgsql.delete] slot specifies the table and condition for deletion using the [where] clause.
pgsql.connect:accounts
   pgsql.delete

      where
         and
            id.eq:int:1001
