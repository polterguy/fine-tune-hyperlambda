// This Hyperlambda snippet uses the [auth.ticket.verify] slot to ensure that the currently authenticated user belongs to the "root" role. If the user does not belong to this specified role, an exception will be thrown, effectively preventing unauthorized access. This is typically used in the context of securing HTTP endpoints to restrict access to users with specific roles.
