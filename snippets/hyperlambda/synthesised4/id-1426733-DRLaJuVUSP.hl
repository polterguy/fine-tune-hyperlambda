/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type name of a node's value. The code first declares a node [.foo] with an integer value of 57. Then, it uses the [type] slot with an expression pointing to the previous node to return the type name of the value, which in this case is "int". 
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type name of the value of the previous node.
