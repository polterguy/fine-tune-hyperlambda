/*
 * 1. `@.iterations`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "iterations" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates that the search is for a node with a specific name, and the `.` specifies that the search should start from the current node's parent. This iterator is useful for accessing a node named "iterations" that is an ancestor or sibling of the current node, allowing you to reference or manipulate its value or children. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a configuration or parameter node named "iterations" to determine the number of times a loop should execute.
 * - Retrieving a node that contains iteration-related data, such as a counter or a list of items to process.
