/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "arguments" node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `databaseType` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "databaseType" from the previously retrieved children nodes. This is typically used to access a specific argument named "databaseType" that might be passed to a slot or function.
