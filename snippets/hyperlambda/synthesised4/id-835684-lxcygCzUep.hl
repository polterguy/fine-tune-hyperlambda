// This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database using a specified connection string and performs a read operation on the "contacts" table. It includes a left join with the "clients" table, counts the entries, and applies conditions from the arguments to the "where" clause. The result is limited to one record and returned. Key slots include [data.connect] for database connection, [data.read] for reading data, and [return-nodes] for returning the result.
