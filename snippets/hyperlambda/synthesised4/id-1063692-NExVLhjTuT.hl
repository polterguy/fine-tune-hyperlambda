// 1. `@.public-key-filename`: This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which means it looks for the first node with the name "public-key-filename" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful for retrieving a specific node by name when you know the node's name but not its exact location in the hierarchy. It will not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors up in the hierarchy.
