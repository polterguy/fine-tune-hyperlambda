// This Hyperlambda code updates the value of a node with the name "completion" by concatenating its current value with additional strings. It uses [set-value] to modify the node's value, and [strings.concat] to concatenate the current value of the "completion" node with two newline characters and a string that includes a URL. The URL is retrieved from the [.arguments] node using [get-value]. The resulting value is a formatted string that appends the URL information to the existing content of the "completion" node.
