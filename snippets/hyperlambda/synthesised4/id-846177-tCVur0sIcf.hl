// The code snippet uses the [eq] slot to compare the value of a node referenced by the expression [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/Key] with the static string "PRI". If the values are exactly the same, the [eq] slot evaluates to true. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression, which navigates through the node structure to find the "Key" node within the [.dp] node.
