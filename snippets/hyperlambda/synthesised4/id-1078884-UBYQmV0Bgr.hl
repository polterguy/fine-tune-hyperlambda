/*
 * 1. `@crypto` - This iterator searches for the first node named "crypto" in the current context. It is used to locate a node that might contain cryptographic functions or data.
 * 
 * 2. `hash` - This iterator navigates to the child node of the previously found "crypto" node that is named "hash". It is used to access hashing-related functionalities or data.
 * 
 * 3. `sha256` - This iterator further navigates to the child node of the "hash" node that is named "sha256". It is likely used to access the SHA-256 hashing function or related data.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve a node that contains the SHA-256 hashing function, which can then be used to hash data securely.
 * - It might be part of a larger Hyperlambda script that performs cryptographic operations, such as verifying data integrity or creating digital signatures.
