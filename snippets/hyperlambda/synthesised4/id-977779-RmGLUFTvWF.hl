// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else-if] slot to evaluate a condition where it checks if the value of [request-type] is equal to "POST". If this condition is true, it executes a lambda that sets the value of [response] to "Storing data". This structure is used for conditional branching in Hyperlambda, allowing different actions based on the evaluated condition.
