// This Hyperlambda code uses an [else] block to set the value of a node referenced by [.url]. It concatenates a base URL with a slash and a specific part of another node's value, extracted using a lambda expression. The [else] block is executed only if preceding conditions in an [if] or [else-if] block evaluate to false. The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine the base URL, a slash, and a specific segment of another node's value into a single URL string.
