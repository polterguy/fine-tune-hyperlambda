 * 1. `@.columns` - This iterator searches for the first node named "columns" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "columns" node found by the previous iterator. It collects all direct child nodes under the "columns" node, allowing further operations or evaluations to be performed on each of these child nodes.
