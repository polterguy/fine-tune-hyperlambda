// 1. `@.no` - This iterator looks for the first node with the name "no" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to find a specific node that is an ancestor of the current node, such as retrieving configuration settings or shared data that is defined at a higher level in the hierarchy.
