// This Hyperlambda code uses the [set-name] slot to change the names of all nodes referenced by its expression to the value obtained from the [get-value] slot. The [set-name] expression targets nodes that are two levels down from its current context, while the [get-value] retrieves the value of the [group_column] node from the [.arguments] node.
