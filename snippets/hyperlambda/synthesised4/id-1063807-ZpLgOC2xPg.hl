// 1. `@.migration-script-folder`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "migration-script-folder" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It will not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. This is useful when you need to find a specific configuration or setting node that is defined higher up in the hierarchy, such as a folder path or a configuration setting that applies to the current context.
