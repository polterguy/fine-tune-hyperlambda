// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [yield] slot to return the result of a database read operation. It retrieves all rows from a data source using the [data.read] slot and then yields these rows as the output of the current lambda execution. The [yield] slot is used to return the result of the operation, allowing the data to be further processed or returned to the caller.
