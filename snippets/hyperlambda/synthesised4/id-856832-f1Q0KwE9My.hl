// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node's short description is not null and not an empty string. It uses the [and] slot to combine two conditions: [not-null] verifies the presence of a value in the short description, and [neq] ensures the value is not an empty string. Together, these slots confirm that the short description is both present and non-empty.
