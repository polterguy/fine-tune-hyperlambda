/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `session`. It is used to specifically target the `session` node among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access a session-related argument passed to a Hyperlambda function or slot. It is useful in scenarios where session data needs to be retrieved or manipulated within a Hyperlambda execution context.
 * - It can be used in an HTTP endpoint to access session information provided as part of the request arguments, allowing the endpoint to perform operations based on the session data.
