/*
 * 1. `@.function-result`: This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which is used to find the first node with a specific name in the current context. In this case, it looks for the first node named `function-result`. The `.` before `function-result` indicates that it is looking for this node in the current context or scope. This iterator is useful when you need to access the result of a function or operation that has been stored in a node named `function-result`. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the output of a previously executed function to use in further processing or decision-making.
 * - Accessing the result of a computation or operation to log it or send it as a response in an HTTP endpoint.
