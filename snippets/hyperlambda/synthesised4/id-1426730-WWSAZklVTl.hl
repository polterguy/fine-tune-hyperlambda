/*
 * This Hyperlambda code takes the result of a [strings.split] operation, retrieves all nodes from the second node onward, and joins them into a single string separated by colons. The [strings.split] operation is assumed to have been executed previously, and its results are being accessed here. The [strings.join] slot concatenates the values of these nodes with ":" as the separator. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.join] - Concatenates the values of nodes with a specified separator.
 * 2. [x:@strings.split/*/[1,100]] - Retrieves all nodes from the result of [strings.split], starting from the second node.
 * 3. [.:":"] - Specifies the colon character ":" as the separator for the join operation.
