// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [or] slot to evaluate two conditions. It checks if either the first name or the last name contains a substring specified by the [filter] argument. If either condition is true, the [or] slot evaluates to true. This is useful for filtering data based on partial matches in either the first or last name fields.
