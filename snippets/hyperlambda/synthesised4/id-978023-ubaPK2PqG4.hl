// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each node returned by the [data.read] expression and sends an email to the address specified in the [email] node of each iterated node. The email has a subject "Login Reminder" and a plain text body reminding the recipient to log in and update their profile. The [for-each] slot is used to loop through the nodes, and the [mail.smtp.send] slot constructs and sends the email for each iteration.
