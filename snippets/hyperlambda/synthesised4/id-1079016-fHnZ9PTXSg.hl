/*
 * 1. `@.extra-tokens`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "extra-tokens" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It looks for a node named "extra-tokens" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is located higher up in the hierarchy, such as a configuration or setting node that applies to multiple child nodes. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to check or manipulate a specific configuration or setting that is defined at a higher level in the hierarchy, such as retrieving additional tokens or parameters that are required for processing within a certain context.
