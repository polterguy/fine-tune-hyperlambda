/*
 * 1. `@.tmp-prompt`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "tmp-prompt" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it will search for this node name, and the "." implies it will start the search from the current node's parent, moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. 
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate data associated with a specific node named "tmp-prompt" within a larger graph structure, especially when the node's position is not fixed but its name is known.
