/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of its previous result set. It is useful when you want to move downwards in the hierarchy to the next node at the same level.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It's used to access all direct descendants of the current node.
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes obtained from the previous `*` iterator. It allows you to access the grandchildren of the original node.
