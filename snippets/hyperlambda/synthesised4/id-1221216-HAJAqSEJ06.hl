// Retrieves a subset of nodes from the first [.arguments] node it finds upwards in the hierarchy. Specifically, it retrieves up to 1000 children nodes starting from the second child node (index 1). This can be useful for processing or analyzing a large number of argument nodes while skipping the first one, such as when you have a list of parameters or configurations and you want to exclude the first one for some reason.
