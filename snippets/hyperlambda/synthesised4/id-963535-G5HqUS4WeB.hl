// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to split a string into multiple parts using [strings.split] and then join these parts back together with a newline character using [strings.join]. The [strings.split] slot divides a string into segments based on a specified delimiter, while [strings.join] combines these segments into a single string, inserting a newline character ("\n") between each segment.
strings.join:x:@strings.split/*
