// 1. `@.private-key`: This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which indicates that it will search for the first node with the name "private-key" in the current context. The `.` following the `@` symbol specifies that the search should begin from the current node's context. This expression is typically used to retrieve a specific configuration or sensitive data node, such as a private key, from within a larger data structure. The use case for this expression is to securely access and utilize a private key stored within the node structure, ensuring that operations requiring this key can be performed without exposing it unnecessarily.
