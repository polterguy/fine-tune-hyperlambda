/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet evaluates whether the value of the "Default" node, which is a child of the current node referenced by [.dp], is not equal to a specified value. The [not] slot negates the result of the [eq] slot, which checks for equality between the value of the "Default" node and a given value. If they are not equal, the [not] slot returns true. 
 * 
 * 1. [not] - Negates the boolean result of its child condition.
 * 2. [eq] - Checks if two values are equal.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/Default] - Retrieves the value of the "Default" node, which is a child of the node referenced by [.dp].
 * 4. [.] - Represents the value to compare against the "Default" node's value.
