/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to perform addition operations on nodes within a Hyperlambda structure. It retrieves nodes from specified paths using the [get-nodes] slot and adds their values together. Specifically, it accesses nodes under [.arguments] with names [to] and [from], and adds their values, storing the result in the node path [.exe/*/signal]. This operation is useful for dynamically combining values from different parts of a Hyperlambda graph.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Performs addition on the values of the nodes specified by the expressions.
 * 2. [get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/to] - Retrieves the nodes under [.arguments] with the name [to].
 * 3. [get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/from] - Retrieves the nodes under [.arguments] with the name [from].
