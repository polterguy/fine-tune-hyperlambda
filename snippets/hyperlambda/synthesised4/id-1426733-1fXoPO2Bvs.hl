 * This Hyperlambda code retrieves all nodes that are descendants of the [urls] node, which is itself a child of any node under the [signal] node. The [get-nodes] slot is used to reference these nodes, allowing further operations to be performed on them.

 * 1. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes based on the expression provided.
 * 2. [@signal/*/urls/*] - Expression pointing to all nodes under the [urls] node, which is a child of any node under the [signal] node.
