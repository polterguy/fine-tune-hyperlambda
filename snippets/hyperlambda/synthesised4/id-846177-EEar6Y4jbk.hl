// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to handle a conditional branch where none of the preceding conditions are met. It sets the value of the [connection] node by concatenating a generic string with the value of the [database] argument, enclosed in brackets. The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine these components into a single string.
