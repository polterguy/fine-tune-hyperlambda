// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and retrieve the names of nodes that are deeply nested within a structure. The expression "+/*/*/*/name" navigates through the hierarchy to access these names, allowing the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate the expression before reaching the node where it's referenced.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*/name
