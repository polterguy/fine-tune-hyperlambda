// 1. `@.sql` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "sql" that is at the same level or higher in the hierarchy relative to the current node. It does not traverse sibling nodes but rather looks upwards in the hierarchy to find the first occurrence of a node named "sql". This is useful when you want to access a specific node that might be defined earlier in the Hyperlambda code, ensuring that you are referencing the correct node without having to specify the entire path.
