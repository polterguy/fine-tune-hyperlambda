// The code snippet demonstrates how to save a lambda object as a Hyperlambda text file using the [io.file.save] slot. It retrieves the Hyperlambda representation of a lambda object using [lambda2hyper] and saves it to a file specified by the [.dp] node. The [get-value] slot is used to obtain the Hyperlambda text from the [lambda2hyper] node.
io.file.save:x:@.dp/#
   get-value:x:@lambda2hyper
