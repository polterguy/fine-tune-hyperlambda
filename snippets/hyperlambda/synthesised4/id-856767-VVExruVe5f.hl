// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes to a destination node. It targets the [.result] node and adds a set of nodes, each containing a [prompt], [uri], and [distance] node, which are derived from the current node being iterated over, indicated by [.dp]. This allows for the dynamic construction of a node structure based on existing data.
