/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `@.arguments` - This iterator again retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" within the previously retrieved "arguments" node. This suggests that there might be nested argument structures, and this step is used to delve into the second level of arguments.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current result set, which in this case is the second "arguments" node. This is used to access all the individual argument nodes within the second "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 4. `max_context_tokens` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "max_context_tokens". It is used to specifically target the node that holds the maximum context tokens value.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda script to retrieve the value of the "max_context_tokens" argument from a nested argument structure. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to enforce or check token limits in a context, such as limiting the number of tokens processed in a language model or API call.
