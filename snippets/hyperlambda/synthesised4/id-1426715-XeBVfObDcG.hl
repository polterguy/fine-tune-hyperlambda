 * The Hyperlambda code unwraps the URL value from a node structure by navigating through the hierarchy using the expression `./*/signal/*/url`. This effectively retrieves the URL node's value from within a nested structure, allowing further operations or evaluations on the extracted URL. 
 * 
 * 1. [unwrap] - Evaluates the expression to retrieve and forward the value of the specified node.
 * 2. [x:./*/signal/*/url] - The expression navigates through the node hierarchy to locate and extract the URL node's value.
