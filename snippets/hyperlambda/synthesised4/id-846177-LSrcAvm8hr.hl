// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [case] slot to evaluate a node's value against multiple conditions, executing the corresponding block of code when a match is found. This is useful for branching logic based on specific values. The [case] slot is typically used within a [switch] block to handle different scenarios based on the value of a node.
