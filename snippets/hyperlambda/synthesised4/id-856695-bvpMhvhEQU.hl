// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes into multiple destination nodes. It targets all [candidates] nodes under [return] nodes and adds a new node structure with [name], [expression], and [complete] as children. The [name] and [expression] nodes use expressions to set their values, while [complete] is set to a boolean true.
