// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates a conditional [if] statement that evaluates a logical [and] condition. It checks if two equality conditions are true using [eq] for both [SOME_EXPRESSION] and [SOME_OTHER_EXPRESSION] against their respective values [SOME_VALUE] and [SOME_OTHER_VALUE]. If both conditions are met, the [.lambda] block is executed.
