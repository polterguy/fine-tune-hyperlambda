// This code snippet uses the [math.add] slot to calculate the total rewards by summing up the values from three different sources: purchases, referrals, and promotions. Each of these values is retrieved using the [get-value] slot, which points to specific nodes within the [rewards] structure. The result is the combined total of these three reward sources.
