// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing for forward evaluation. In this example, the expression "x:+/*/*" is evaluated, and the result is assigned to the node where [unwrap] is used. This is useful for dynamically determining node values before execution.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
