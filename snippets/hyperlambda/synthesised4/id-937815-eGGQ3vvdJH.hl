// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [validators.string] slot to enforce a minimum length constraint on a string argument. Specifically, it validates that the [password] argument within the [.arguments] node has a minimum length of 12 characters. If the [password] does not meet this length requirement, an exception will be thrown.
validators.string:x:@.arguments/*/password
