// The Hyperlambda code performs a SQL query to select the prompt and the maximum completion value from the "ml_requests" table, filtered by a specific user ID, questionnaire, and context, and groups the results by the prompt. It uses the [data.select] slot to execute the SQL query and dynamically injects the user ID from the arguments.
data.select:@"
select prompt, max(completion) as completion
   from ml_requests
   where user_id = @user_id and questionnaire = 1 and context = 1
   group by prompt"
   user_id:x:@.arguments/*/user_id
