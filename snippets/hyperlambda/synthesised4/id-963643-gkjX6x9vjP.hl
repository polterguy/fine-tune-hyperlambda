// This Hyperlambda code constructs a URL by concatenating a base URL with an API key and a URL-encoded query parameter. It uses [strings.concat] to combine the base URL, the API key retrieved with [get-value], and a query string. The query parameter is URL-encoded using [strings.url-encode] to ensure it is safely included in the URL. The final URL is stored in the [.url] node using [set-value].
