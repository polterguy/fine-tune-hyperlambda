// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of a node specified by its expression. It navigates through the node structure to find the node at the path [.dp/#/*/path] and returns its value. The expression uses iterators to traverse the node hierarchy, where [.dp] is the current node being processed, [#] de-references its value, [*] retrieves its children, and [/path] filters to the node named "path".
