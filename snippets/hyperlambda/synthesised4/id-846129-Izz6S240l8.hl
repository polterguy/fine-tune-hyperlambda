// This Hyperlambda code checks if the result of a [data.scalar] operation is equal to zero. The [eq] slot is used to compare the value obtained from [data.scalar] with the static value of 0, returning true if they are the same. The [data.scalar] slot typically executes a scalar SQL query, fetching a single value, which is then compared using [eq].
