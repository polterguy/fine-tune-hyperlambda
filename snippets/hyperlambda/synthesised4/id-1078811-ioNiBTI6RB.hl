/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "signal" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node within the hierarchy to start the traversal from.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. It is used to access the immediate children of the "signal" node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of each child node of the "signal" node. It is used to access the grandchildren of the "signal" node.
 * 
 * 4. `=magic` - This iterator filters the nodes retrieved by the previous iterators to only include those nodes whose value is "magic". It is used to find nodes with a specific value among the grandchildren of the "signal" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to find all nodes that are two levels deep under a "signal" node and have the value "magic". This might be useful in a configuration or settings file where certain nodes are marked with the value "magic" to indicate special behavior or properties.
