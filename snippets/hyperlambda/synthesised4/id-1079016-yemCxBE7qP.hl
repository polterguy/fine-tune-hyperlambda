/*
 * 1. `@.model`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "model" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches through the siblings and ancestors of the current node to find the first occurrence of a node named "model". 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access configuration or metadata stored in a "model" node that is shared across multiple parts of a Hyperlambda script.
 * - It can be used to retrieve a specific data model or schema definition that is required for processing or validation in the current context.
