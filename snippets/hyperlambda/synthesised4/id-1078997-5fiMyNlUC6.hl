/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" from the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by its name. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is expected to be present in the current execution context.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is another node, allowing you to work with the node itself rather than just its value. This is particularly useful when the value of a node is a reference to another node structure.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It is used to access all immediate children of a node, which is useful when you need to perform operations on all child elements.
 * 
 * 4. `Type` - This final part filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "Type" from the previously retrieved children. It is used to specifically target nodes named "Type" for further processing or evaluation.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include scenarios where you need to access and manipulate nodes of a specific type within a dynamically passed node structure, such as processing or validating data types in a configuration or data processing task.
