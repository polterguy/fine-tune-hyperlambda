/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert new nodes into a node set. The [add] slot targets the node referenced by the expression in its value, which in this case is the value of the [.dp] node. It then appends two new nodes: [tokens] with an integer value of 16385, and [chat] with a boolean value of true, as children of the targeted node.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts new nodes into the node set referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the parent node for the new children nodes.
 * 3. [tokens] - A new node with an integer value of 16385.
 * 4. [chat] - A new node with a boolean value of true.
