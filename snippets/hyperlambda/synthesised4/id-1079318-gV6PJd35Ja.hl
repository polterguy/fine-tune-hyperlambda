/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is useful for accessing the arguments node in a Hyperlambda file, typically used in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints to retrieve input parameters.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument passed to the slot or endpoint, allowing further operations or evaluations on these arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving all input parameters for a dynamic slot or HTTP endpoint to validate or process them.
 * - Iterating over all arguments to perform operations such as logging, validation, or transformation.
