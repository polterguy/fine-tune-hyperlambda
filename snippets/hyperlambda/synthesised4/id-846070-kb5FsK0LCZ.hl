// The [case] slot is used within a [switch] block to define a specific condition to match against the evaluated value of the [switch]. If the value of the [switch] matches the value of a [case], the corresponding block of code is executed. The [case] slot must have a value, which can be a constant or an expression, and it is used to determine if the [switch] should execute the [case] block.
