// The code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL join operation using Hyperlambda, specifically joining the "users_extra" table with an alias "ue2" on the condition that the "username" column in the "users" table is equal to the "user" column in the "users_extra" table. This is achieved using the [join] slot with [as] for aliasing and [on] for specifying join conditions, utilizing [and] and [eq] for logical and equality checks.
join:users_extra
   as:ue2
   on
      and
         users.username.eq:ue2.user
