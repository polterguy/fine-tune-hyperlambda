// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to determine the type of a node's value. It first declares a node [.foo] with an integer type and a value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to retrieve the type of the node's value, which in this case is "int". The [type] slot is invoked with an expression pointing to the node whose type is to be determined, and it returns the type name as a string. This functionality is useful for dynamically checking and verifying the types of values within a Hyperlambda script.
