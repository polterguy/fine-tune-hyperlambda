// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and "unwrap" a complex expression that navigates through a series of nodes. The expression "+/*/*/*" is a lambda expression that traverses the node graph, moving to the elder sibling, then through multiple levels of children nodes. The [unwrap] slot ensures that this expression is evaluated before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing for dynamic evaluation of node paths in a Hyperlambda graph.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*
