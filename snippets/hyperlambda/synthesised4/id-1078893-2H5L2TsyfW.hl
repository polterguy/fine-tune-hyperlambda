/*
 * 1. `@signal`: This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy to find the first occurrence of a node with this name.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "signal" node found in the previous step. It collects every direct child node under the "signal" node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used to gather all the child nodes of a specific "signal" node, which might represent a set of data or configurations related to a particular signal or event in a system.
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze all elements associated with a "signal" node, such as logging, monitoring, or triggering further actions based on the signal's children.
