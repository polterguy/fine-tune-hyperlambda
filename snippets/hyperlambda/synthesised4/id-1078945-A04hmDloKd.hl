/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of its previous result set, which means it will select the node immediately following the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the node that comes directly after a specific node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. After selecting the elder sibling with the `+` iterator, the `*` iterator will then select all children of that sibling node. This is useful for accessing or processing all child nodes of a specific sibling node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * 
 * - You might use this expression to iterate over all child nodes of a specific sibling node, perhaps to apply a transformation or extract data from each child.
 * - This could be useful in a scenario where you need to process a list of items that are grouped under a specific sibling node in a structured data set.
