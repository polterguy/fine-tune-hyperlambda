/*
 * 1. `@.fields`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "fields" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches for a sibling or ancestor node named "fields" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access configuration or metadata stored in a "fields" node that is located earlier in the node hierarchy.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically reference and manipulate data structures that are defined earlier in the Hyperlambda script.
