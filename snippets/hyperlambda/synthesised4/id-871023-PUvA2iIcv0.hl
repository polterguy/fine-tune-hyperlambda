/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to execute a dynamic slot named "magic.ai.url.get" that retrieves a URL from the "Location" header of an HTTP GET response. It uses the [http.get] slot to perform the HTTP GET request, and then accesses the "Location" header value using a lambda expression. The [headers] node is included to specify any additional HTTP headers needed for the request.
 * 
 * 1. [execute] - Invokes the dynamic slot "magic.ai.url.get".
 * 2. [url] - Retrieves the URL from the "Location" header of the HTTP GET response.
 * 3. [headers] - Specifies additional HTTP headers for the request.
