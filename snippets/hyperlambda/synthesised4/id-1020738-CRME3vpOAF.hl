// 1. `@.reset-email`: This iterator searches for the first node named "reset-email" that is an ancestor of the current node. It will traverse upwards in the hierarchy to find this node. This is useful when you need to access a node that is not a direct sibling or child, but rather exists somewhere above in the hierarchy, allowing you to retrieve its value or interact with it in some way.
