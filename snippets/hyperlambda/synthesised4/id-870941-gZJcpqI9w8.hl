// This Hyperlambda code sends a signal to a specified role using the [sockets.signal] slot. The signal targets the "root" role and includes an argument node with a type of "action". It dynamically assigns the "name" from the [.arguments] node and includes an "input" node, facilitating communication or triggering actions within a system. The [sockets.signal] slot allows for real-time messaging to roles, users, or groups, making it useful for event-driven architectures.
