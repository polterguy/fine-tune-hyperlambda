/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda) of the current node. It moves one step down in the hierarchy, selecting the next sibling node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. After selecting the elder sibling with the `+` iterator, this `*` will select all children of that sibling node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the result set from the previous `*`. It further drills down into the hierarchy, selecting all descendants of the children nodes retrieved by the first `*`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to traverse a node structure, starting from a given node, moving to its next sibling, and then gathering all descendant nodes two levels deep. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze a specific subset of nodes in a structured data set, such as extracting detailed information from a sibling node and its descendants in a configuration or data file.
