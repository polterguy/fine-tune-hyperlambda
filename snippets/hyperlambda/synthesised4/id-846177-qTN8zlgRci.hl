// The code demonstrates the use of the [switch] slot in Hyperlambda, which functions similarly to a switch/case block in traditional programming languages. It evaluates the value of a specified node and executes the first [case] node that matches this value. If no [case] matches, the [default] node is executed. The [case] node in this example is named "binary".
case:binary
