/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument individually, regardless of their specific names.
 * 
 * 3. `references` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `references` among the children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to specifically target nodes that are intended to hold reference values or identifiers.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a function or slot that processes a list of references passed as arguments, such as validating, logging, or transforming these references.
 * - It could be part of a data processing routine where specific reference nodes need to be extracted and manipulated from a larger set of input arguments.
