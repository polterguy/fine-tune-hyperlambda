// The Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [token_key] exists as a child of [.arguments], is not null, and is not an empty string. It uses [and] to ensure all these conditions are true simultaneously. The [exists] slot verifies the presence of the node, [not-null] ensures it has a value, and [neq] confirms the value is not an empty string.
