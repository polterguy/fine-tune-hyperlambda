/*
 * /*
 *  * This Hyperlambda code constructs a URL by concatenating parts of a split string.
 *  * It uses [set-value] to assign a value to the [.domain] node.
 *  * The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate the URL parts.
 *  * The [get-value] slots retrieve specific parts of the split string.
 *  * The resulting URL is constructed by combining the protocol and domain.
 *  * 1. [set-value] - Assigns the concatenated URL to the [.domain] node.
 *  * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates the parts to form a URL.
 *  * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the protocol part of the split string.
 *  * 4. [.] - Represents the "://" separator in the URL.
 *  * 5. [get-value] - Retrieves the domain part of the split string.
