// The [unwrap] slot in this Hyperlambda code evaluates the expression specified by its value before the node where it's referenced is reached. The expression "x:+" indicates that the node immediately following the current node should be evaluated. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions inside a lambda object, allowing the value to be unwrapped and used before the lambda object is executed.
