/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a signal to a specified session. It includes an [args] node that contains a single argument [finished] with a boolean value of true. This setup is typically used to notify subscribers of the session that a particular event or condition, indicated by the [finished] argument, has occurred. The [args] node is transformed into a JSON object and sent to all connections subscribed to the session specified by the expression in the [sockets.signal] slot. 
 * 
 * 1. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to a specified session.
 * 2. [args] - Contains the arguments to be sent with the signal.
 * 3. [finished] - A boolean argument indicating the event or condition.
