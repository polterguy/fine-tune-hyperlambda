/*
 * Loads the content of a text file specified by the result of a concatenated string expression. This example demonstrates combining the [io.file.load] and [strings.concat] slots to dynamically construct a file path by concatenating strings, and then loading the file content from the resulting path.
 * 
 * 1. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into a single string, which is used to form a dynamic file path.
 * 2. [io.file.load] - Loads the content of the text file located at the path generated by the concatenated string.
