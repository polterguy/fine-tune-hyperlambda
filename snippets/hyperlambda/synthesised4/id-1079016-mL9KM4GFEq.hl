/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It is used to access the arguments node, which typically contains input parameters or configuration settings for the current context.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access all the parameters or settings defined within the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `model_size` - This iterator filters the result set to include only the nodes with the name "model_size". It is used to specifically access the "model_size" parameter, which likely indicates the size of a model being configured or used.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to dynamically access and use the "model_size" parameter from a set of arguments, such as when configuring a machine learning model or setting up a computational task that requires knowledge of the model's size.
