// This Hyperlambda code connects to a MySQL database named "auth_db" and reads from the "users" table. It selects the count of all entries in the "users" table, aliasing the result as "count", and limits the result to one record. The [data.connect] slot establishes the database connection, while [data.read] specifies the table and columns to query.
