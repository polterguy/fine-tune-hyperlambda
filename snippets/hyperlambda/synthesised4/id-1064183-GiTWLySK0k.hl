/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed into a function or slot, especially in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is useful when you want to iterate over or access all argument nodes provided to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `aggregate_function` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `aggregate_function` among the children of the `.arguments` node. It is typically used to access a specific argument by name, which in this context is expected to be a function or a value related to aggregation.
