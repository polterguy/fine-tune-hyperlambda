/*
 * 1. `@.data` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "data" from the current context. It starts the search from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful for targeting a specific section of the node structure that is labeled as "data".
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "data" node. It allows you to access all direct descendants of the "data" node, which is useful when you want to perform operations on or analyze each child node individually.
 * 
 * 3. `old-name` - This iterator filters the children nodes retrieved by the `*` iterator to only include nodes named "old-name". It is used to narrow down the node set to those that match the specified name, allowing you to focus on specific nodes within the children of "data".
