// This Hyperlambda code connects to an SQL Server database named "ecommerce_db" and reads data from the "orders" table. It selects a count of all records in the table, aliasing the result as "count", and limits the result set to one record. The database type is specified as Microsoft SQL Server (mssql) for both the connection and the read operation.
