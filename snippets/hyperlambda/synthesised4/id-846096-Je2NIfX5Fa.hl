// This code snippet demonstrates how to change the value of a node using the [set-value] slot in Hyperlambda. It utilizes the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specific string within the node's current value. The [set-value] slot targets the [.result] node, and the [strings.replace] slot is used to replace occurrences of the string specified by the [rtl] node with "true". The process involves evaluating the [strings.replace] slot to obtain the modified string, which is then assigned to the [.result] node.
set-value:x:@.result
   strings.replace:x:@.result
      .:[[rtl]]
      .:true
