// This Hyperlambda code checks if both the [.feature-enabled] and [.user-logged-in] nodes have truthy values using the [and] slot. If both conditions are true, it sets the value of the [.status] node to "ready" using the [set-value] slot. The [get-value] slot is used to retrieve the values of the nodes being checked.
