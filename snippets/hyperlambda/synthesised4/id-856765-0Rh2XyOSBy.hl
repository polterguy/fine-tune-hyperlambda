// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [max_context_tokens] node, which is a child of the [model] node, to the result of a division operation. The division result is retrieved using the [get-value] slot, pointing to a previously executed [math.divide] operation. The [set-value] slot updates the node's value with the calculated division result.
