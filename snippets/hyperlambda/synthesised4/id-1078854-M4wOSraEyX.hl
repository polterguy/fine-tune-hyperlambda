/*
 * 1. `@.models`: This iterator searches for the first node named "models" within the current node's context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to locate a specific node in a potentially complex structure where the node might not be a direct child.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator. In this case, it will return all child nodes of the "models" node. This is useful for operations that need to process or evaluate each child node under a specific parent, such as iterating over a list of model configurations or data entries.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving and processing all model configurations defined under a "models" node in a configuration file.
 * - Iterating over a list of models to apply a specific operation or transformation to each one.
