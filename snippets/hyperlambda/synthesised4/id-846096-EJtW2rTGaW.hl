/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a file exists by using [io.file.exists] with a dynamically constructed filename from [strings.concat]. If the file exists, it sets the [.filename] node's value to the concatenated string using [set-value]. The [if] slot is used to conditionally execute the [set-value] operation based on the existence of the file.
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks the condition if the file exists.
 * 2. [io.file.exists] - Determines if the file specified by the concatenated string exists.
 * 3. [strings.concat] - Dynamically constructs the filename to check.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 5. [set-value] - Sets the value of [.filename] to the concatenated filename.
 * 6. [get-value] - Retrieves the concatenated filename value.
