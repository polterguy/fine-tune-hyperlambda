// The [data.select] slot is used to execute arbitrary SQL queries on a connected database and return the results as a lambda object. It allows for executing SQL statements and retrieving multiple result sets if specified. The [data.scalar] slot, similar to [data.select], executes SQL but returns a single value, often used for aggregate results. The [data.read] slot is used for selecting records from a database with optional arguments like columns, order, direction, limit, offset, where, join, and group.
