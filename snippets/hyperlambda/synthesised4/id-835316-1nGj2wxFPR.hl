// The [unwrap] slot in this code evaluates the expression provided, which traverses multiple levels of nodes to reach the [content] node. The [unwrap] slot ensures that the value of the [content] node is evaluated before the node where [unwrap] is invoked is reached, effectively "forward evaluating" the expression.
