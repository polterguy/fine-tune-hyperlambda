/*
 * 1. `@.function-result`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "function-result" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a match. This is useful for accessing the result of a previously executed function or operation within the same scope or hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: 
 * - Accessing the result of a function that was executed earlier in the same Hyperlambda script to perform further operations or validations based on that result.
