/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node, meaning it selects the node immediately following the current node in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the next node in sequence relative to your current position.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it will select all children of the elder sibling node identified by the `+` iterator. This is useful for accessing all nested nodes under a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - The second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes selected by the previous `*` iterator. This effectively drills down two levels of hierarchy from the elder sibling node, allowing access to deeply nested nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access and manipulate data that is two levels deep in the hierarchy of the elder sibling node. For example, if you have a list of configurations or settings and you need to apply changes or gather information from deeply nested properties of the next configuration in sequence, this expression would be suitable.
