// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [session] exists within the [.arguments] node and ensures it is not null. The [and] slot combines these two conditions, evaluating to true only if both conditions are met. The [exists] slot checks for the presence of the [session] node, while [not-null] verifies that the node has a non-null value.
