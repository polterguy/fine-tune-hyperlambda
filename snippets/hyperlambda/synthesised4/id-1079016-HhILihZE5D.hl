/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "session" that is an ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name, and the `.` before "session" specifies that it should look for this node among the current node's ancestors. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving session-related data in a web application where session information is stored in a node named "session".
 * - Accessing configuration or state information that is stored in a "session" node higher up in the hierarchy, which might be relevant for the current operation or context.
