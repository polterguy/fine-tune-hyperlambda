/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join operation on a SQLite database using the [data.read] slot. The code specifies a table named "Employees" and performs a left join with itself, using the alias "ReportsTo" for the joined table. The join condition is defined by matching the "ReportsTo" column in the "Employees" table with the "EmployeeID" in the "ReportsTo" alias. The [columns] section lists all the columns to be retrieved from the query, including various employee details and the last name of the employee's supervisor, which is aliased as "ReportsTo.LastName". The [where] clause is included but currently does not specify any conditions. Finally, the [return-nodes] slot is used to return the results of the data read operation.
 * 
 * 1. [data.read] - Initiates a data read operation from the specified database.
 * 2. [database-type] - Specifies the type of database being used, in this case, SQLite.
 * 3. [table] - Indicates the primary table to read data from, here it's "Employees".
 * 4. [join] - Specifies a join operation with the same "Employees" table, using an alias "ReportsTo".
 * 5. [as] - Provides an alias for the joined table, "ReportsTo".
 * 6. [type] - Defines the type of join, which is a left join in this case.
 * 7. [on] - Specifies the join condition, matching "Employees.ReportsTo" with "ReportsTo.EmployeeID".
 * 8. [columns] - Lists the columns to be retrieved in the query result.
 * 9. [where] - Placeholder for any additional filtering conditions, currently empty.
 * 10. [return-nodes] - Returns the nodes resulting from the data read operation.
