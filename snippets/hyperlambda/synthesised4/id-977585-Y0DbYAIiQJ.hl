// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses [data.select] to execute a SQL query that selects the "greeting" column from the "ml_types" table, filtering the results based on the "type" value provided in the [.arguments] node. The [type] slot is used to dynamically insert the value from the [.arguments] node into the SQL query, allowing for parameterized querying.
data.select:"\nselect greeting\n\tfrom ml_types\n\twhere type = @type"
   type:x:@.arguments/*/type
