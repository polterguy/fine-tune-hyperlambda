// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each [email] node within the [user] nodes inside the [.users] node. For each [email] node found, it sets its value to "hidden@example.com". The [for-each] slot is used to loop through the nodes, and the [set-value] slot changes the value of the current node, referenced by [.dp].
