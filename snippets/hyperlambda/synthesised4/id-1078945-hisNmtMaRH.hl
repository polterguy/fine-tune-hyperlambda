/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing the root arguments node in a Hyperlambda execution context, which typically contains input parameters or data passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any parameter or data nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `data` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "data" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target a node named "data" within the arguments, which might contain specific data or values needed for processing.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - Accessing a specific data node within the arguments passed to a Hyperlambda function or endpoint, which could be used for further processing or validation.
 * - Retrieving configuration or input data that is structured under a "data" node within the arguments for dynamic processing in a Hyperlambda script.
