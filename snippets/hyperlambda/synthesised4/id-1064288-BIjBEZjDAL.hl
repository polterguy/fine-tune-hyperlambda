/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator returns the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot, typically at the beginning of a Hyperlambda file or dynamic slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node, which in this case is the "arguments" node. It is used to access all the argument nodes provided under the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `group_column` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "group_column". It is used to specifically access the value of the argument named "group_column" from the list of arguments.
