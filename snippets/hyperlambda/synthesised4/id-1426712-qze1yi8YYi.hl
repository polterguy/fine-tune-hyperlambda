/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a signal to a session, with arguments transformed into JSON. It retrieves the function result from a configuration setting using [config.get], and includes the invocation and file details from the [execute] node's children, specifically targeting the [json] and [workflow] nodes. This setup allows for dynamic signaling based on session-specific configurations and execution details. 
 * 
 * 1. [sockets.signal] - Initiates a signal to a session.
 * 2. [args] - Specifies the arguments to be sent with the signal.
 * 3. [function_result] - Retrieves a configuration setting using [config.get].
 * 4. [invocation] - References the [json] node from the [execute] node's children.
 * 5. [file] - References the [workflow] node from the [execute] node's children.
