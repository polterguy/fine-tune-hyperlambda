/*
 * 1. `@strings.split`: This iterator searches for the first node named `strings.split` in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by its name, ensuring that the subsequent operations are performed on the correct node. This is useful when you need to perform operations or retrieve values from a node with a known name within a larger structure.
 * 
 * 2. `0`: This iterator retrieves the first child node of the previously selected node. In this context, it is used to access the first child of the `strings.split` node. This is helpful when you want to work with the first element in a list or collection of nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `-`: This iterator retrieves the younger sibling of the current node, which is the node immediately preceding it in the Hyperlambda structure. It is used to navigate to the previous node at the same hierarchical level, allowing you to access or manipulate nodes that are adjacent to the current one.
