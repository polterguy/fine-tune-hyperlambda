// This Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied as a value. It specifically targets the [.vectorize] node within the [.onafter] node, which is a child of the [magic.ai.crawl-site] node. The [unwrap] slot is used to ensure that any expressions within the [.vectorize] node are evaluated, allowing for dynamic execution of the node's content. The expression traverses the node hierarchy to locate and process the desired node.
