// 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before in its hierarchy that matches the given name, which in this case is "fingerprint". It searches for a node named "fingerprint" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is an ancestor of the current node, ensuring that you get the closest matching node in the hierarchy.
