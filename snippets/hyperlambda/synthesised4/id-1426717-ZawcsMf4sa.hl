// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [convert] slot in Hyperlambda to convert the value of a node to a different type. In this example, the value of the [.foo] node, which is originally a string "57", is converted to an integer type using the [convert] slot. The conversion is specified by the [type] node, which is set to "int". This allows the value to be used in contexts where an integer is required.
convert:true
