/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the node hierarchy.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access all the immediate descendants of a node.
 * 3. `data.create` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "data.create". It is used to narrow down the node set to specific nodes of interest.
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes resulting from the previous iterator. It is used to access all the immediate descendants of the "data.create" nodes.
 * 5. `values` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "values". It is used to further narrow down the node set to specific nodes of interest under the "data.create" nodes.
