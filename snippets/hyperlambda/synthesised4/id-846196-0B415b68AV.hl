// The code demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda, which executes its child nodes if all preceding conditional slots evaluate to false. Here, the [eval] slot is used within the [else] block to execute a lambda object referenced by the [invoke] node. This setup allows for conditional execution of code based on prior conditions, defaulting to the [else] block when no other conditions are met.
