/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "sql" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access a specific node named "sql" that might contain SQL query information or configuration details related to database operations. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: You might use this expression in a Hyperlambda script to dynamically access and execute SQL queries stored in a node named "sql" within your current execution context. This could be part of a larger operation where you need to retrieve data from a database or perform some database-related task.
