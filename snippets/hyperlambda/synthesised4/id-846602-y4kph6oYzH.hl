// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [insert-before] slot to insert a node named [group_column] before the first child node of the [columns] node, which is a child of the [data.read] node, itself a child of the [data.connect] node. This operation is useful for dynamically modifying the structure of a Hyperlambda node tree by adding new nodes at specific positions.
