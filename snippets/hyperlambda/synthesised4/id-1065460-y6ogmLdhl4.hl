 * 1. `@.words`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "words" from the current context. It is used to navigate to a specific node within the hierarchy, assuming that "words" is a direct child of the current node or context.
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the "words" node. It is used to access all nodes that are directly under the "words" node, regardless of their names or types. This is useful for iterating over or processing all elements contained within the "words" node.
