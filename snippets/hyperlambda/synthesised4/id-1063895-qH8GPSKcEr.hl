// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node named `.sql` within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that the search is for a node by name, and the `.` prefix specifies that the search is within the current node's scope or hierarchy. This is useful for retrieving specific nodes by name when you know the structure of your Hyperlambda graph and need to access a particular node directly.
