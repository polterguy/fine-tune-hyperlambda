// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specific location in a node hierarchy. The [add] slot targets the [data.delete] node's [where] clause and appends nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot, which references all nodes under the [.arguments] node. This effectively integrates argument nodes into a SQL-like delete operation's where clause, allowing for dynamic query construction based on input arguments.
