 * 1. `@.max-size`: This iterator searches for the first node named "max-size" within the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, looking for a node with the specified name. 
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression can be used to retrieve a configuration or setting value, such as the maximum allowed size for a file upload, from a node named "max-size" that might be defined at a higher level in the hierarchy.
