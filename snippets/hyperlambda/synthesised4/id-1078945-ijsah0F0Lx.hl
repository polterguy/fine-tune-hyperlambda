 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches through the current node's siblings and ancestors to find the first occurrence of a node named "session".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access session-related data in a Hyperlambda graph, such as user session information or session-specific variables, which might be necessary for authentication, authorization, or maintaining state across different parts of an application.
