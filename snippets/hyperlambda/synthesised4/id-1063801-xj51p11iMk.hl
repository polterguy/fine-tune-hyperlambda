/*
 * The expression `@strings.concat` is a simple Hyperlambda expression that uses a single iterator. Below is an explanation of the iterator used in this expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@strings.concat`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "strings.concat" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it looks for a node by its name. This type of iterator is useful when you need to locate a specific node by its name to perform operations on it or retrieve its value. In the context of Hyperlambda, "strings.concat" is typically a slot used to concatenate multiple string values. This expression would be used to find the "strings.concat" node so that its functionality can be utilized, such as concatenating strings passed as its children nodes.
