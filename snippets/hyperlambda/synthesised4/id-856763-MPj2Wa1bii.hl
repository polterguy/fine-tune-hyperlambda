// This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of the string "[CONTEXT]" within a node pointed to by the expression in [@.prompt] with the value obtained from [get-value], which retrieves the context value from a signal's context node. The [strings.replace] slot facilitates dynamic string manipulation by allowing the replacement of specified substrings with values derived from other nodes or slots.
strings.replace:x:@.prompt
