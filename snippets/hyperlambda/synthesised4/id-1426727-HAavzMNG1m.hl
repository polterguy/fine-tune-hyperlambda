// This Hyperlambda code uses the [sleep] slot to pause the execution of the current thread for 100 milliseconds. The [sleep] slot is non-blocking, meaning it releases the thread back to the operating system while it is "sleeping", allowing other processes to utilize the CPU resources during this time. This is useful in scenarios where you want to introduce a delay without consuming CPU resources unnecessarily.
