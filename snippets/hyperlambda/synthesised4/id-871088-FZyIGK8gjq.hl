 * // This Hyperlambda code checks if a specific node does not exist and removes another node if the condition is true.

 * // 2. [not] - Inverts the result of its child condition.
 * // 3. [exists:x:@execute/*/urls/0] - Checks if the first node under "urls" exists.
 * // 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * // 5. [remove-nodes:x:@execute/*/urls] - Removes the "urls" node if the condition is met.
