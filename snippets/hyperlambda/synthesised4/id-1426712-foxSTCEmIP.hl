// The [unwrap] slot in this Hyperlambda code is used to forward evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this case, it evaluates the expression "x:+/*/*", which navigates to a specific node in the structure, and assigns its evaluated value to the current node. This allows for dynamic evaluation of expressions within the Hyperlambda graph.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
