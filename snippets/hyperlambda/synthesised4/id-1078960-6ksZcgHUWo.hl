/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in its current context. It is used to locate a specific node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. It is used to access the immediate descendants of the "signal" node, allowing further filtering or processing of these nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `disallow` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "disallow" among the children of the "signal" node. It is used to narrow down the selection to specific nodes of interest under the "signal" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to check if there are any "disallow" nodes under a "signal" node, which might be useful in scenarios where certain actions or signals are restricted or need to be validated.
 * - It could also be used in a configuration or settings context where certain signals are marked as disallowed, and the system needs to retrieve and process these restrictions.
