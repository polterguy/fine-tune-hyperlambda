/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.mixin] slot to dynamically combine a prompt with the completion text from a specific node path. The [strings.mixin] slot takes an expression pointing to the completion nodes under [.scan/0], and mixes it with the prompt provided in the [.arguments] node, effectively creating a combined string output. The result is a string that includes both the prompt and the completion text. The code is useful for generating dynamic strings by combining static and dynamic content. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.mixin] - Combines a prompt with completion text from a specified node path.
 * 2. [prompt] - Provides the prompt text to be mixed with the completion text.
