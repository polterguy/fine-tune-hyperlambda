// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes into a destination node's children collection. It specifically adds a node with the name derived from the value of the current node being iterated over, into each [args] node found within the [return-nodes] node. The [add] slot uses the expression to locate all [args] nodes under [return-nodes], and the [.dp] node is used to reference the current node in the iteration, allowing its value to be used as the name for the new node.
