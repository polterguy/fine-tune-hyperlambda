// The code demonstrates the use of the [yield] slot to return a value from a dynamically created slot or function. It uses [strings.concat] to concatenate strings and assigns the result to a [tag] node, which is then returned by the [yield] slot. This allows the result of the concatenation to be accessed by the caller of the dynamic slot.
