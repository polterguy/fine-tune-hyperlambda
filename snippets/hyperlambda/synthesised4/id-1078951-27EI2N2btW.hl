// 1. `@.file-meta`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "file-meta" that is an ancestor of the current node. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors up in the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to access metadata or configuration information that is defined at a higher level in the hierarchy, such as file-level metadata or settings that apply to a group of nodes. Potential use cases include accessing file metadata in a document processing system or retrieving configuration settings in a hierarchical data structure.
