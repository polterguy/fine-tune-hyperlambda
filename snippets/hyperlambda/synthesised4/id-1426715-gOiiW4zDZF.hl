// This Hyperlambda code snippet converts the value of the [max_request_tokens] node within the [model] node to an integer type. It uses the [convert] slot to change the data type, ensuring that the value is treated as an integer for subsequent operations. The expression [x:@.model/*/max_request_tokens] specifies the node to be converted.
convert:x:@.model/*/max_request_tokens
