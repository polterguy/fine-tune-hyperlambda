/*
 * The Hyperlambda code checks if the [insert_url] node in [.arguments] is true, and if so, it appends a formatted URL reference to the [completion] node. It uses [strings.concat] to concatenate the existing value of [completion] with additional strings, including a URL from [.arguments]. The result is a multi-line string that includes a reference to a URL. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if the [insert_url] node in [.arguments] is true.
 * 2. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [completion] node.
 * 3. [strings.concat] - Concatenates strings to form a new value for [completion].
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the current value of [completion] and the URL from [.arguments].
