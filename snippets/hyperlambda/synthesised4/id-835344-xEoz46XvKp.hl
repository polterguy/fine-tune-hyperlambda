// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database named "magic" and reads data from the "users_extra" table, filtering records where the user matches the current authenticated user and the type is either "name" or "email". It then iterates over each result, setting the name and value of nodes based on the "type" and "value" fields of each record, and adds these to an "extra" node. The code effectively maps database records to a structured node format for further processing.
