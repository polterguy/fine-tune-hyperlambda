/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node, which in this case is the "arguments" node. It allows access to all argument nodes provided to the slot or function.
 * 
 * 3. `group_column`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to find the first node named "group_column". It is used to specifically access the argument or parameter named "group_column" within the arguments. This is often used to obtain a specific value needed for processing or logic within the Hyperlambda code.
