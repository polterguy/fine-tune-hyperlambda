/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "signal" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by its name, starting the search from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. It is used to access any direct child nodes under the "signal" node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `context` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "context" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically target nodes named "context" that are children of the "signal" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access configuration or state information stored under a "context" node within a "signal" node, which might be part of a larger system for handling signals or events.
 * - It could be used in a logging or monitoring system to extract context-specific data related to a particular signal or event for analysis or debugging purposes.
