/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `massage`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "massage". It is used to specifically access the "massage" argument from the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function to retrieve the value of an argument named "massage" that was passed to the function. This might be useful in a scenario where the function needs to process or validate a massage-related input.
