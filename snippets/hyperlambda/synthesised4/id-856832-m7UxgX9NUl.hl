// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.delete] slot to remove records from the "ml_training_snippets" table. It specifies a [where] condition using [and] to ensure that only records with a specific [type] from the [.arguments] node and a [meta] value of "woocommerce-import" are deleted. The [type.eq] and [meta.eq] slots are used to compare the values for deletion criteria.
