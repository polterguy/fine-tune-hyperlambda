/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type of a node's value. It assigns an integer value to a node named [.foo] and then uses the [type] slot to obtain the type of this node's value. The result of invoking [type] will be the type name of the value, which in this case is "int".
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type of the value of the node above it.
