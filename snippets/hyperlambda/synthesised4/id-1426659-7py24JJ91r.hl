/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement with multiple [case] conditions to determine the value of a [result] node based on the value of a [status] node. The [switch] statement evaluates the [status] node and executes the corresponding [case] block if the value matches. If no [case] matches, the [default] block is executed. The code is useful for handling multiple conditional branches based on a single variable's value.
 * 
 * 1. [status] - Declares a node with a value that will be evaluated in the [switch] statement.
 * 2. [switch] - Begins a switch statement to evaluate the [status] node.
 * 3. [case] - Specifies a condition to match the [status] node's value.
 * 4. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [result] node based on the matched [case].
 * 5. [default] - Executes if no [case] conditions are met, setting a default value for the [result] node.
