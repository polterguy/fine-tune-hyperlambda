// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" that is a sibling of the current node. It uses the `@` symbol to reference nodes by name, and the `.` symbol to denote the current node's context. The use case for this expression could be to retrieve a SQL query or command stored in a node named "sql" for execution or further processing.
