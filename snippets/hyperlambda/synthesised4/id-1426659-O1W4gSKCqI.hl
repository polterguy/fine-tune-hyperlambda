 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if the value of the first node in the result set, obtained by navigating through the specified path, is not equal to a given value. The path navigates to the first node with the name "href" under the current node's [.dp] node, and compares its value to an unspecified value. If the values are not equal, the [neq] slot will evaluate to true.
 * // 1. [neq] - Compares the value of the specified node with another value to check for inequality.
 * // 2. [x:"@.dp/#/*/\@href/[0,1]"] - Expression to navigate to the first "href" node under the [.dp] node.
 * // 3. [.] - Represents the value to compare against, which is unspecified here.
