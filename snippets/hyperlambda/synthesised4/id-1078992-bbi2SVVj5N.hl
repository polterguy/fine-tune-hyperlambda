/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to navigate to the top of the node hierarchy, allowing access to the entire structure from the root. This can be useful when you need to evaluate or manipulate nodes at the highest level of the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it is used after navigating to the root node to access all of its direct children. This is useful for iterating over or evaluating all immediate descendants of the root node.
 * 
 * 3. `sqlite.connect` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name `sqlite.connect`. It is used to locate specific nodes within the children of the root node that are related to SQLite database connections. This is useful when you need to perform operations related to SQLite connections, such as establishing or closing a connection.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Similar to the previous `*` iterator, this retrieves all children nodes of the `sqlite.connect` node. This allows access to any configuration or operational nodes that are direct descendants of the `sqlite.connect` node, which might include parameters or commands related to the database connection.
 * 
 * 5. `return-nodes` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name `return-nodes`. It is used to locate specific nodes that are intended to return data or results from operations performed within the `sqlite.connect` context. This is useful for retrieving the output or results of database operations, such as query results or status messages.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * - Establishing a connection to an SQLite database and retrieving the results of a query or operation performed on the database.
 * - Accessing configuration or operational details related to an SQLite connection and returning relevant data or status information.
