// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a new node to the [session] node. It uses the [add] slot to insert a child node under [session], which contains a nested structure with [role] and [content] nodes. The [role] node is set to "system", and the [content] node's value is dynamically retrieved from the [new-prompt] node. This structure is useful for organizing session data with specific roles and content.
