// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to update records in a SQLite database table named "crawl_urls" using the [data.update] slot. It specifies the database type as SQLite and includes a [values] node to define the columns and values to be updated. The [where] node, combined with an [and] condition, is used to filter which records should be updated, ensuring that only specific records meeting the criteria are modified.
