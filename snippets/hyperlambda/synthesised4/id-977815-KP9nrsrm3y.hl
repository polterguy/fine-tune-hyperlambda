// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database named "usersdb" and retrieves a single record from the "users" table where the "id" column equals 1. It uses [data.connect] to establish the connection and [data.read] to perform the query with a [where] condition and a [limit] of 1 to ensure only one record is returned.
data.connect:usersdb
   data.read
      table:users
      where
         and
            id.eq:int:1
      limit:int:1
