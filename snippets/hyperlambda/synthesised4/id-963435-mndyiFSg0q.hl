// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to add a node to the result of the [return-nodes] slot. It retrieves the first node from the result of a [strings.split] operation and adds it to the specified location. The [add] slot is used to modify the structure by inserting new nodes, and the [strings.split] is used to split a string into parts, where this code specifically targets the first part.
