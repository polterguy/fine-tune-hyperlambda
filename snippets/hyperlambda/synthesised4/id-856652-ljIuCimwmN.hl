// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [insert-after] slot to insert nodes after a specified node in a hierarchical structure. It targets the [operationId] node within a nested structure and inserts two new nodes, [consumes] and [produces], immediately after it. The [consumes] node retrieves its value from a deeply nested node using an expression, while the [produces] node is assigned a static value of "application/json". This approach is useful for dynamically modifying a node graph by adding new nodes based on existing node values.
