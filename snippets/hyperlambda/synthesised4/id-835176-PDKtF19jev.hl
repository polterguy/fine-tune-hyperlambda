// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [yield] slot to return the result of a [lambda2hyper] operation. The [lambda2hyper] slot converts a lambda object into a Hyperlambda string, and the [yield] slot then returns this string as a result. This process is useful for serializing lambda objects into text for storage or transmission.
