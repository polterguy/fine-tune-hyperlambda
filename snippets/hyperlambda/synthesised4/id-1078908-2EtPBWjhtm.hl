/*
 * 1. `@.max-context-tokens`: This iterator starts with an `@` symbol, which indicates that it will search for the first node with the name "max-context-tokens" in the current context. The `.` following the `@` symbol specifies that the search should begin from the current node's parent. This means it will look for a sibling node named "max-context-tokens" starting from the current node's parent. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve the value of a configuration or setting related to the maximum number of context tokens allowed in a particular operation or process.
 * - It might be useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically adjust or check the maximum context tokens setting within a larger Hyperlambda script or application logic.
