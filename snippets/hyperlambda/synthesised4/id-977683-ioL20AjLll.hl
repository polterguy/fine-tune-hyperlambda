/*
 * The code demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to construct a SQL query that counts the number of rows in the "roles" table. It specifies a limit of 1 for the result set and includes a placeholder for a [where] condition using [and]. The [columns] node specifies the aggregation function [count(*)] with an alias "count". This setup is useful for retrieving the total number of entries in a table while allowing for additional filtering conditions. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.read] - Initiates a SQL read operation on the specified table.
 * 2. [table] - Specifies the table name from which to read data.
 * 3. [columns] - Declares the columns to be selected in the SQL query.
 * 4. [count(*)] - Uses an aggregate function to count rows.
 * 5. [as] - Provides an alias for the column result.
 * 6. [where] - Placeholder for adding conditional logic to filter results.
 * 7. [and] - Placeholder for logical conjunction in the where clause.
 * 8. [limit] - Restricts the number of records returned by the query.
