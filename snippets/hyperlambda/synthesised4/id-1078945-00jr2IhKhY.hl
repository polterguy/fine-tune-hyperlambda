// 1. `@.type`: This iterator looks for the first node named `type` in the current context. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards through its ancestors. This is useful when you need to retrieve a specific node's value or reference in a hierarchical structure, such as when determining the type of an object or data segment in a configuration or data processing task. This expression is particularly useful in scenarios where the `type` node might be defined at a higher level in the hierarchy, and you need to access it from a nested context.
