// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [switch] slot to perform conditional branching based on the value of [input-value]. It evaluates the value of [input-value] and executes the corresponding [case] block if the value matches "foo" or "bar", logging an appropriate message. If the value does not match any [case], the [default] block logs a message indicating the value was neither "foo" nor "bar".
switch:x:@.arguments/*/input-value
   case:foo
      log.info:Value was foo
   case:bar
      log.info:Value was bar
   default
      log.info:Value was neither foo nor bar
