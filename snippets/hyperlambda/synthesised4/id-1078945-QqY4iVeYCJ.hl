// 1. `@http.post`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "http.post" in the current context. The `@` symbol is used to search for a node by its name, and it will return the first match it finds. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate data related to an HTTP POST request within a Hyperlambda script. A potential use case could be to extract information from an HTTP POST request node to process or validate the request data further.
