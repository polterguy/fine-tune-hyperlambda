// The [set-value] slot changes the value of the node referenced by its expression. In this case, it modifies the value of the node currently being iterated in a [for-each] loop, as [.dp] is a reference to the current node in the loop. The [#] iterator ensures that the value of the node itself is accessed and changed.
