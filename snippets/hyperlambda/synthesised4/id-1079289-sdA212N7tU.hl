// 1. `@.no` - This iterator looks for the first node with the name "no" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first matching node it encounters. This is useful when you need to find a specific ancestor node or a node that is not a direct child or sibling of the current node. A potential use case could be to retrieve configuration or state information stored in a node named "no" that is relevant to the current context.
