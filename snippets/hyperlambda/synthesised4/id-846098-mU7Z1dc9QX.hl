/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda, which executes a block of code if all preceding conditional slots evaluate to false. In this example, the [else] block contains a [set-value] slot that updates the value of the [result] node by using the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of the string "[[submit_button]]" with "false" within the current value of [result]. 
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes its children nodes if no preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are true.
 * 2. [set-value] - Updates the value of the [result] node.
 * 3. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a specified string within the [result] node's value.
