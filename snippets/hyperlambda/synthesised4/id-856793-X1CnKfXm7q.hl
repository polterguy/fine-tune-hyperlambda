// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-name] slot to change the name of a node referenced by [.dp] to a sanitized version of its current name. The [strings.replace-not-of] slot is used to replace any character in the node's name that is not an alphanumeric character or underscore with an underscore. The [get-name] slot retrieves the current name of the node to be sanitized.
