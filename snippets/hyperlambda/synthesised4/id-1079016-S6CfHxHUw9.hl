/*
 * 1. `@.session` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" from the current context. It starts the search from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and their children, until it finds a node named "session". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access session-related data in a Hyperlambda application, such as retrieving user session information or session-specific variables. 
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you need to verify or manipulate session data, like checking if a user is logged in or retrieving session-specific settings.
