// This Hyperlambda code snippet dynamically adds nodes to all [log-invocation] nodes found in the parent node's siblings. It retrieves nodes from the [meta] node inside the [.arguments] node and appends these nodes to each [log-invocation] node. The [add] slot is used to perform the addition, and [get-nodes] retrieves the nodes to be added.
