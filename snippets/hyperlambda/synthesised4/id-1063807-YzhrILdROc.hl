// 1. `@.database-type`: This iterator searches for the first node named "database-type" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for retrieving configuration or setting values that are defined at a higher level in the node hierarchy.
