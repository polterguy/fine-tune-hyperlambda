// The code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes to a specific location in the Hyperlambda graph. It uses the [add] slot to insert nodes from the [get-nodes] slot, which retrieves nodes referenced by its expression. The [add] slot targets the path "./*/data.read/*/where/*", effectively appending nodes retrieved from the [get-nodes] invocation, which points to all nodes within the [.arguments] node. This operation is useful for dynamically modifying the node structure based on existing arguments.
