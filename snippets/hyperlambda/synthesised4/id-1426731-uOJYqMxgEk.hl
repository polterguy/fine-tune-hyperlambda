// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied with an expression that navigates to the next sibling node and then retrieves all its children and grandchildren nodes. This operation will evaluate the specified nodes, allowing their values to be used or manipulated before the current node is processed further.
