/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below) of the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. It is useful when you want to move downwards in the hierarchy to the next sibling node.
 * 2. `/+` - This iterator, combined with the previous `+`, retrieves the elder sibling of the node obtained from the previous step, effectively moving two nodes downwards in the hierarchy.
 * 3. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node obtained from the previous step. It is useful for accessing all direct descendants of a node.
 * 4. `/*` - This iterator, applied again, retrieves all children nodes of each node obtained from the previous step, allowing access to the next level of descendants in the hierarchy.
