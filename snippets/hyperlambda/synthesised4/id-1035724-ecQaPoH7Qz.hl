 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name in the current context. In this case, it looks for the first node named `.file-content`.
 * 2. `.file-content` - This is the name of the node that the `@` iterator is searching for. The expression will return the first occurrence of a node named `.file-content` within the current scope. 
 * 
 * This expression is useful when you want to access a specific node by its name in a Hyperlambda structure, particularly when you are interested in the first occurrence of that node.
