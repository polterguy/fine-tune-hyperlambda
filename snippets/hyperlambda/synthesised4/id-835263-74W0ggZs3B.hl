// The code checks if there are any nodes under [.disallow] using [exists]. If nodes exist, it adds these nodes to the current context and appends a [disallow] node to the return path of a [try] block. This ensures that if [.disallow] has children, they are processed and a [disallow] node is added to the return structure.
