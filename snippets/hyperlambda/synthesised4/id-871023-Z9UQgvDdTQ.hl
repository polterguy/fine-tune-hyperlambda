// This Hyperlambda code uses the [eq] slot to check if the value retrieved from [http.get] is equal to 301. The [eq] slot compares two arguments and returns true if they are exactly the same. Here, it evaluates whether the HTTP status code from a previous [http.get] operation matches 301, which typically indicates a resource redirection.
eq:x:@http.get
