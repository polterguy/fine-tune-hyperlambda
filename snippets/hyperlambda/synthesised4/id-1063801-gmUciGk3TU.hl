/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda hierarchy) of the current node. It is used to move downwards in the node hierarchy to access the next node at the same level.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It allows for accessing all the child nodes of the current node, enabling traversal deeper into the node hierarchy.
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator again retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set, which are the children of the nodes retrieved by the first `*` iterator. This allows for accessing the next level of child nodes.
 * 4. `*` - This third `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set, which are the children of the nodes retrieved by the second `*` iterator. This enables accessing even deeper levels of child nodes in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * This expression is used to navigate through a node structure by first moving to the next sibling node and then accessing multiple levels of child nodes, effectively allowing for deep traversal starting from a sibling node.
