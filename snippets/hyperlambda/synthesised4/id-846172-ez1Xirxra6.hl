/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses logical operations to evaluate conditions. It checks if the value of the node [dflt_value] within the current [dp] node is not equal to an empty string or null. The [and] slot ensures both conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. The [not] and [eq] slots are used to perform the negation and equality checks, respectively. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Ensures both conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true.
 * 2. [not] - Negates the result of the equality check.
 * 3. [eq] - Checks if the value of [dflt_value] is equal to an empty string.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [dflt_value] node.
 * 5. [not] - Negates the result of the second equality check.
 * 6. [eq] - Checks if the value of [dflt_value] is equal to null.
