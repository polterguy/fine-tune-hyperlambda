/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the maximum number of requests for a model has been reached. If the maximum requests value is not -1 and the current number of requests is greater than or equal to the maximum, it throws a public exception with a status code of 500.
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Begins a conditional statement.
 * 2. [and] - Combines two conditions that must both be true.
 * 3. [neq] - Checks if the value of [max_requests] is not equal to -1.
 * 4. [mte] - Checks if [no_requests] is more than or equal to [max_requests].
 * 5. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the conditions are true.
 * 6. [throw] - Throws an exception with a specific message, making it public with a status code of 500.
