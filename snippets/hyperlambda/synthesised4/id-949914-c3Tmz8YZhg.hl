// This Hyperlambda code uses the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions. It retrieves the values of [condition1] and [condition2] using [get-value] and checks if both are true. The [and] slot will only return true if both conditions evaluate to true, otherwise, it returns false. This is useful for combining multiple conditions in logical operations.
