/*
 * 1. `@sort` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "sort" in the current hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy to find the first occurrence of a node named "sort". This is useful when you need to access a specific node named "sort" that might be located at a higher level or as a sibling in the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `0` - This iterator retrieves the first child node of the node found by the previous iterator. It is used to access the first child of the "sort" node. This is helpful when you want to directly work with or manipulate the first child of a specific node, in this case, the "sort" node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a node structure that includes a "sort" node, and you need to access or modify its first child node, perhaps to apply some sorting logic or configuration.
