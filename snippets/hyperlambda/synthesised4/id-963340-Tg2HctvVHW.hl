// The code snippet uses the [xml2lambda] slot to convert an XML string obtained from an HTTP GET request's content into a lambda object. The expression [x:@http.get/*/content] specifies the location of the XML data within the HTTP response, allowing the [xml2lambda] slot to parse and transform it into a structured lambda format.
xml2lambda:x:@http.get/*/content
