// This Hyperlambda code snippet modifies the value of the [.result] node by replacing occurrences of a placeholder [[css]] with the first non-null value from a list of potential sources. The [set-value] slot is used to change the [.result] node's value, while [strings.replace] performs the string replacement. The [get-first-value] slot retrieves the first non-null value from the specified sources, which include [get-value] invocations pointing to [.arguments/*/css] and [.arguments/*/file]. This pattern is useful for dynamically inserting content into a template or configuration.
