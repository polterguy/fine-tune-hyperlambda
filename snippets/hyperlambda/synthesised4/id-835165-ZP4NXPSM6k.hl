// The code snippet uses the [yield] slot to return values from a dynamic slot or an executed file. It retrieves the [ticket] value from the result of an [execute] invocation and includes additional nodes from [.extra]. The [yield] slot ensures these values are returned to the caller, effectively combining results from different sources into a single output.
