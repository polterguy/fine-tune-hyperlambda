/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator looks for the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` ensures it starts from the current node's context, looking for a direct child or sibling node named [.arguments]. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any nodes that are directly under the [.arguments] node, which could include various parameters or data elements that are part of the arguments.
 * 
 * 3. `order` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [order]. It is used to specifically target a node named [order] within the children of the [.arguments] node, allowing the expression to focus on this particular piece of data. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate the value of the [order] node specifically.
