// The code demonstrates the use of the [not] slot to negate the result of an [exists] slot, which checks if a specified node or set of nodes exists. If the [exists] slot evaluates to true, the [not] slot will negate it to false, and vice versa. This combination is useful for executing logic when a node does not exist.
