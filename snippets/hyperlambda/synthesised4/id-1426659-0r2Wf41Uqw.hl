// This Hyperlambda code snippet trims the trailing slash ("/") from the end of the string value obtained from the [href] attribute of the [base] node within the [head] section of a parsed HTML structure. The expression navigates through the HTML nodes to specifically target the [href] attribute, and [strings.trim-end] removes the specified character from the end of the string.
strings.trim-end:x:"@html2lambda/*/head/*/base/*/\\@href/[0,1]"
