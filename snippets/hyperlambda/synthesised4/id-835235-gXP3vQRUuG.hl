// This Hyperlambda code sends a multipart/form-data POST request to the OpenAI API to upload a file for fine-tuning purposes. It includes an Authorization header with a token, and specifies the Content-Type as multipart/form-data. The payload consists of two entities: one for the JSONL file data with its Content-Disposition set to a filename, and another for specifying the purpose of the upload as "fine-tune". The convert argument is set to true, enabling automatic conversion of the response.
