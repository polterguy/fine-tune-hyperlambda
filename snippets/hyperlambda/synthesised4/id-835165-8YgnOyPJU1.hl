// The code snippet demonstrates how to create a new JWT token using the [auth.ticket.create] slot. It specifies the username as "root" and assigns the user to the "root" role. This operation is typically performed within an authenticated context, such as an HTTP endpoint, to generate a token that can be used for subsequent authenticated requests.
auth.ticket.create
   username:root
   roles
      .:root
