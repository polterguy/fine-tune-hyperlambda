// 1. `@.score`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "score" within the current context. The `@` symbol signifies that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and traversing upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name that might not be a direct child of the current node, allowing you to retrieve its value or perform operations on it.
