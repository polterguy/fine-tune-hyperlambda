/*
 * 1. `@.url`: This iterator looks for the first node named "url" in the current context, starting from the root node of the Hyperlambda object and traversing downwards. It will return the first occurrence of a node with this name. 
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression can be used to retrieve the value of a URL node, which might be used for making HTTP requests or for logging purposes. If you have a configuration or data structure where URLs are stored under nodes named "url", this expression will help you access them efficiently.
