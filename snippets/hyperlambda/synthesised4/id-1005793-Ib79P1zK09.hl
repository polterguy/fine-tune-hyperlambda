 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is useful when you need to access the top-level node of the current execution context, regardless of the current node's position in the hierarchy.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it will retrieve all children nodes of the root node.
 * 3. `.foo1` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name ".foo1". It is useful when you want to specifically target nodes with a particular name from a set of nodes.
