// This Hyperlambda code updates the value of a node's description by extracting a substring from its current description. It uses [set-value] to change the description, and [strings.substring] to get the first 300 characters from the description. The [set-value] expression targets a node by reference, and [strings.substring] specifies the starting position and length of the substring.
set-value:x:@.dp/#/*/description
