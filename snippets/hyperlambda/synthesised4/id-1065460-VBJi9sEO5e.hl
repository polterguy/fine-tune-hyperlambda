// 1. `@.no`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no" that is an ancestor or sibling of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy or across siblings. This is useful for accessing a specific node that is not a direct child of the current node, allowing you to reference nodes that are higher up or alongside in the structure.
