/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the node hierarchy. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate the parent node of the current context.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children of the parent node obtained from the previous step. This is useful for iterating over or accessing all children nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `return` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "return". It is used to specifically target nodes named "return" among the children of the parent node. This is useful when you want to perform operations or checks on nodes with a specific name.
 * 
 * 4. `**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the current result set, including the node itself, using a breadth-first search algorithm. In this context, it retrieves all descendants of the "return" nodes. This is useful for accessing or manipulating all nodes within a subtree rooted at the "return" nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to gather all nodes within the subtree of "return" nodes, perhaps to analyze or modify the data within those nodes.
 * - It could also be used in a validation or logging process to ensure that all "return" nodes and their descendants meet certain criteria or to extract information from them.
