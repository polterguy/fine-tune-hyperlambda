// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of nodes referenced by a dynamically composed expression to "completion". The expression is dynamically created using the [compose] slot, which constructs an expression to locate nodes based on the value of the "completion" argument. The [set-name] slot then renames these nodes to "completion".
set-name:x:"@.dp/#/*/\"{@.arguments/*/completion}\""
