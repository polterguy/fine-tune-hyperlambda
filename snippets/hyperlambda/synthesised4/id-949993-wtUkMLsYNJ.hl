// This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database named "magic" and executes a SQL statement to delete records from the "ml_requests" table. The deletion criteria are based on records created more than 14 days ago and where the "cached" and "questionnaire" fields are either 0 or null. The [sqlite.connect] slot establishes the connection, while [sqlite.execute] runs the SQL command.
sqlite.connect:magic
   sqlite.execute:"delete from ml_requests where created < date('now', '-14 day') and (cached = 0 or cached is null) and (questionnaire = 0 or questionnaire is null)"
