// This code snippet demonstrates the use of the [fork] slot to execute a [math.subtract] operation in a separate thread. The [math.subtract] slot is used to subtract 40 from 100, and the operation is executed concurrently, allowing the main thread to continue without waiting for the subtraction to complete.
fork
   math.subtract
      .:int:100
      .:int:40
