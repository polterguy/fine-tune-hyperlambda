// The code checks if the node referenced by the expression [@execute] is not null. If it is not null, it throws an exception with the message "Could not scrape URL", marking it as a public exception and using the value of [@execute] as the status code. The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, while [not-null] checks the existence of the node.
