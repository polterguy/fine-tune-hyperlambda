// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a new node to the [.session] node. It creates a nested structure where a node with the name [role] and a value of "system" is added, along with a [content] node. The value of the [content] node is dynamically set to the value of the [system_message] node found within [.arguments]. This operation is typically used to append system-related messages to a session, ensuring that the message is tagged with a "system" role for further processing or logging.
