 * 1. `+` - Retrieves the next sibling node (the node immediately below the current node at the same indentation level).
 * 2. `+` - Retrieves the next sibling node again (the node two steps below the current node at the same indentation level).
 * 3. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the current node.
 * 4. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of each of the previously selected nodes.
 * 5. `.sse` - Filters out all nodes not named [.sse] from the previous result set.
 * 6. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of each [.sse] node.
 * 7. `.type` - Filters out all nodes not named [.type] from the previous result set.
 * 
 * This expression navigates from the current node to its second next sibling, then descends two levels into all children, filters for nodes named [.sse], retrieves their children, and finally filters for nodes named [.type]. The result is all [.type] nodes that are descendants of [.sse] nodes, which themselves are descendants two levels below the second next sibling of the current node.
