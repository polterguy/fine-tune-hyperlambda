// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement, where the [case] node has a value of "float". The [switch] statement evaluates a given expression and executes the first matching [case] node's children. If the [switch] expression matches the value "float", the corresponding [case] node will be executed. This allows for conditional execution based on the evaluated value of the [switch] expression.
