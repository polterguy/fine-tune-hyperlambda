/*
 * 1. `@.fields`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "fields" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches for a node named "fields" among the siblings and ancestors of the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access configuration or metadata stored in a "fields" node that is defined earlier in the hierarchy.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to reference a specific set of fields or parameters that are defined at a higher level in the structure, such as in a configuration file or a data schema.
