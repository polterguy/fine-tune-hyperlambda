/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "session" that is before the current node in the hierarchy. It is useful for accessing session-related data or configurations that are defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing session variables or data stored in a session node to perform operations based on user session information.
 * - Retrieving session-specific settings or configurations that are needed for further processing or decision-making in the Hyperlambda code.
