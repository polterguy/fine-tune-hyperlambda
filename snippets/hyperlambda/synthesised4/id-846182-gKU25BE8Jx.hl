// The code snippet uses the [not] slot to evaluate whether the value of the [connection-string] node within the [.arguments] node is not equal to an empty string. It employs the [eq] slot to check for equality, and the [get-value] slot to retrieve the value of the [connection-string] node. If the value is not an empty string, the [not] slot returns true.
