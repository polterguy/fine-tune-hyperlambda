// This Hyperlambda code snippet concatenates a string that forms a file attachment header. It combines static text with a dynamic file name retrieved from the [.arguments] node, resulting in a string like "attachment; filename=\"[file_name]\"". The [strings.concat] slot is used to merge these parts into a single string.
strings.concat
   .:"attachment; filename=\""
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/file
   .:"\""
