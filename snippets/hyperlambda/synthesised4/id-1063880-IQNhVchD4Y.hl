/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node. It is used to navigate to the node that is directly below the current node in the hierarchy.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node. It is used to access every child node under the current node.
 * 3. `headers` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "headers". It is used to specifically target nodes named "headers" from the previously selected node set. 
 * 
 * The expression `.:x:+/*/headers` is used to navigate from the current node to its next sibling, then retrieve all children of that sibling, and finally filter those children to only include nodes named "headers". This could be useful in scenarios where you need to access HTTP headers or similar structures in a hierarchical data set.
