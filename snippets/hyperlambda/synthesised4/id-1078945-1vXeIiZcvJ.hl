/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.new-prompt` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and since it is prefixed with a dot, it will search for a node with an exact name match including the dot. This is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate a specific node within a Hyperlambda structure, especially when dealing with nodes that are meant to store temporary or intermediary data. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to access a specific configuration or data node within a larger Hyperlambda script, allowing for dynamic adjustments or retrievals based on the node's value or children.
