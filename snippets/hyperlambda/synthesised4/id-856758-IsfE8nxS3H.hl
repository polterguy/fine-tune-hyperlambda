/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [return] slot to return a static node with a value. The [return] slot is used to exit a lambda execution and return a node structure to the caller. In this example, it returns a single node named [result] with the value "error". This is typically used in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints to send a response back to the client or caller.
 * 
 * 1. [return] - Exits the lambda execution and returns the specified node structure to the caller.
 * 2. [result] - A node with the value "error" that is returned by the [return] slot.
