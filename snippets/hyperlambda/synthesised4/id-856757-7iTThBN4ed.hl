// This Hyperlambda code changes the value of the [filename] node to the value retrieved from a specific path within the [arguments] node. It uses [set-value] to assign a new value to [filename], while [get-value] extracts the value from a nested structure under [arguments]. The expression in [get-value] points to a node path that includes [file] and [name] as part of its hierarchy.
