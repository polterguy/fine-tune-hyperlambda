// The [mysql.transaction.commit] slot is used to explicitly commit an open transaction in a MySQL database. This ensures that all operations performed within the transaction are permanently saved to the database. If this slot is not invoked, the transaction will be rolled back by default, discarding any changes made during the transaction.
