/*
 * This Hyperlambda code constructs a URL by concatenating a base URL with a path extracted from a specific node structure. It first retrieves the base URL using [get-value] from [.base], then appends a "/" character, and finally appends a path extracted using a complex expression pointing to a specific node's attribute value. The result is assigned to the [.url] node using [set-value]. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Assigns the concatenated URL to the [.url] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates the base URL, a "/", and a path to form the complete URL.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.base] - Retrieves the base URL from the [.base] node.
 * 4. [.] - Represents a static string value, here used to add a "/" between the base URL and the path.
 * 5. [get-value:x:"@.dp/#/./*/\\@href/[0,1]"] - Retrieves a path from a specific node structure using a lambda expression.
