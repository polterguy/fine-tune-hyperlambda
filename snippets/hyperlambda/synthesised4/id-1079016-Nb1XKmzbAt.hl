/*
 * 1. `@.tmp-completion`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node in the current context with the name "tmp-completion". The `@` character indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` prefix suggests it is looking for a node at the current level or higher in the hierarchy. This iterator will return the first matching node it finds. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases: 
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve a temporary node named "tmp-completion" that holds intermediate results or data that needs to be processed further.
 * - It might also be used in a scenario where multiple operations are being performed, and the "tmp-completion" node is used to store the state or result of a specific operation.
