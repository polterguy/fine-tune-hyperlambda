// This Hyperlambda code checks if any nodes exist under the path specified by the expression [exists:x:@data.read/*]. If nodes are found, indicating that the model already exists, it executes the lambda object, which throws an exception with the message "Model already exists!". The [if] slot evaluates the condition, and if true, the [.lambda] block is executed.
