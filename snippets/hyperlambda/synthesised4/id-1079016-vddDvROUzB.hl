/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named [arguments] starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or a slot in Hyperlambda. This is crucial when you need to retrieve or manipulate input parameters provided to a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [arguments] node. It is useful when you want to access or iterate over all the arguments provided, regardless of their specific names.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [session]. It is used to specifically target the [session] node among the children of [arguments], which might contain session-related data or identifiers.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a session identifier or session-related data from the arguments passed to a slot or endpoint.
 * - Accessing session-specific parameters for user authentication or maintaining user state across requests.
