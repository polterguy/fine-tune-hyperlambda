/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement, allowing for conditional branching based on the value of a given expression. The [switch] slot evaluates the expression and executes the corresponding [case] block if a match is found. If no match is found, the [default] block is executed. This structure is useful for executing different code paths based on discrete values.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Evaluates an expression to determine which [case] block to execute.
 * 2. [case] - Represents a possible value for the [switch] expression, executing its children if matched.
 * 3. [default] - Executes if no [case] matches the [switch] expression.
