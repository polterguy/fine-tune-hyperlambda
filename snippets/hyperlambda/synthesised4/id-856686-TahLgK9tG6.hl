// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of all nodes referenced by the expression `./*/add/*/*` to the value obtained from the node's type. The [set-name] slot is used to modify node names, and [get-value] retrieves the type of the node currently iterated by reference in a [for-each] loop, using [.dp] to access the iterated node.
