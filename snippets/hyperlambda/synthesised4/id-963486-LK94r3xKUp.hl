// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to insert a record into a "users_roles" table using the [data.create] slot. The [table] node specifies the target table, while the [values] node contains the fields to be inserted. The [role] field's value is dynamically obtained from the current iteration node's value, and the [user] field's value is fetched from the [.arguments] node, specifically the "username" argument. This setup is typically used within a loop to assign roles to users.
data.create
   table:users_roles
   values
      role:x:@.dp/#
      user:x:@.arguments/*/username
