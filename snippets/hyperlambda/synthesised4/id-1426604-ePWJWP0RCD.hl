// The [http.put] slot is used to perform an HTTP PUT request to a specified URL. It requires a [payload] argument, which contains the data to be sent to the endpoint. Optionally, it can include HTTP headers through a [headers] argument. The slot returns the result of the HTTP PUT request, including headers, status code, and the response object. If automatic conversion of the response is needed, a [convert] argument can be set to true.
