// The code retrieves the value of a node specified by the expression, which navigates through a reference node to access a child node named "hyperlambda_id". The [get-value] slot is used to obtain this value, and the expression utilizes iterators to traverse the node hierarchy, starting from a reference node indicated by [.dp].
