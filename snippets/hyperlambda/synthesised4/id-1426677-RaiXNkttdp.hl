// This Hyperlambda code deletes a file whose path is dynamically constructed by concatenating strings. The [io.file.delete] slot is used to delete the file, and the [strings.concat] slot is used to build the file path by concatenating multiple string segments. The expression [x:@strings.concat] indicates that the result of the string concatenation is used as the file path to be deleted.
