/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "arguments" node. It allows you to access each individual argument passed into the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `model_size` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "model_size". It is used to specifically access the argument related to the model size.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda script to retrieve the value of a "model_size" argument passed into a function or endpoint, which might be used to configure or initialize a machine learning model with a specific size parameter.
 * - It could also be used in validation logic to ensure that the "model_size" argument is provided and has a valid value before proceeding with further operations.
