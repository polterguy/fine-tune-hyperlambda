// The code demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using Hyperlambda to read data from a SQLite database. It specifies a table named "clients" and selects columns using an aggregate function, aliasing the result as "result". The query includes a "where" clause with an "and" condition and groups the results by "group_column".
