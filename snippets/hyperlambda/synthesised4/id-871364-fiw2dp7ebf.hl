// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform SQL joins using the [data.read] slot with SQLite as the database type. It joins the "Order Details" table with the "Orders" and "Products" tables using left joins. The joins are based on matching "OrderID" and "ProductID" columns. The [columns] section specifies a distinct function with an alias. The [where] clause is prepared for additional conditions. Key slots include [database-type] for specifying the database, [join] for defining join operations, [columns] for selecting columns, and [where] for filtering results.
