/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" from the current node's hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates that it looks for a node with the specified name, and the `.` indicates that it starts the search from the current node. This is useful when you need to access session-related data or configurations stored in a node named "session" within the current context or hierarchy.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Accessing session variables or data in a web application to maintain user state.
 * - Retrieving configuration settings or parameters stored in a session node for processing or decision-making.
