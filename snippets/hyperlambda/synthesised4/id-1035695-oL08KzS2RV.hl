/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node, which is the node immediately following the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. It is useful for accessing the next node in a sequence or list.
 * 
 * 2. `+` - This second `+` iterator again retrieves the elder sibling of the current node, allowing you to move two nodes forward from the starting node. This is useful when you need to skip a node and access the one after the next.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access the entire set of child nodes, which can be useful for iterating over them or performing operations on each child.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - The second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes obtained from the previous step. This allows you to access the grandchildren of the original node, which is useful for deep traversal or operations that require accessing multiple levels of hierarchy.
