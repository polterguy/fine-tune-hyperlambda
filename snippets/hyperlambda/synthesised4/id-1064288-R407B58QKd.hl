/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to navigate upwards in the node hierarchy to find the "arguments" node, which typically contains the input parameters for a function or endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `limit` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "limit" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically access the "limit" argument, which might be used to control the number of items to process or return in a function or endpoint.
