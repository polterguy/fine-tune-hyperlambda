/*
 * 1. `@.from`: This iterator starts by looking for the first ancestor node with the name "from". It searches upwards in the hierarchy from the current node to find the nearest node named "from". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve configuration or metadata information that is stored in a "from" node higher up in the hierarchy.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to access a common ancestor node's value or properties, such as retrieving the sender's information in a messaging or email processing system.
