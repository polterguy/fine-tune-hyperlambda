/*
 * 1. `@.model` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "model" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy to find the "model" node. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is higher up in the hierarchy, such as a configuration or a data model node that contains important information for the current operation.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "model" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "model" node, regardless of their names. This is useful when you need to process or examine all elements within a particular section of your data structure.
 * 
 * 3. `auth` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "auth" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically target nodes related to authentication, which could contain credentials, tokens, or other authentication-related data.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving authentication details from a data model for processing or validation.
 * - Accessing configuration settings related to authentication that are stored within a larger model structure.
