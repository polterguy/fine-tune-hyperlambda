// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the node specified by the expression [@.arguments/*/pkDefault] is not equal to null. If the node's value is not null, the [neq] slot will evaluate to true. This is useful for ensuring that a particular argument is provided and has a value different from null during execution.
