/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of its previous result set. It is used to navigate to the node immediately below the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the next node in sequence.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all direct child nodes of the current node. This is useful for operations that need to be applied to all children, such as iterating over them or modifying their values.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - The second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set, which is the result of the first `*` iterator. This allows you to access the grandchildren nodes of the original node. This is useful when you need to perform operations on nodes that are two levels deep in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to gather all grandchildren of the next sibling node in a Hyperlambda structure. It is useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze data that is structured in a hierarchical manner, such as XML or JSON-like data representations, and you want to focus on a specific level of the hierarchy starting from a sibling node.
