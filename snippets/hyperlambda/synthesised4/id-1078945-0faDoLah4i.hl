/*
 * 1. `@strings` - This iterator looks for the first node with the name "strings" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, checking siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is not a direct child or descendant of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `substring` - This part is not an iterator but rather specifies that the node being accessed should have a child or a value named "substring". It filters the result set from the previous iterator to include only nodes that have a name or value of "substring". This is useful when you want to perform operations or retrieve data specifically related to a substring operation within a "strings" context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting a substring from a string node within a larger Hyperlambda structure where "strings" operations are grouped together.
 * - Accessing a specific substring operation configuration or result within a node that handles multiple string manipulations.
