/*
 * This Hyperlambda code adds a log entry indicating an error occurred during an OpenAI invocation. The [add] slot is used to append a log message to a specific node path, [log.timeshift] records the error message "Something went wrong while invoking OpenAI" to help diagnose issues with OpenAI interactions. The code structure suggests a focus on logging and error tracking in OpenAI-related processes.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends a node to a specified path.
 * 2. [log.timeshift] - Logs a message indicating an error with OpenAI.
