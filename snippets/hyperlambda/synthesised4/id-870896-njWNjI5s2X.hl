// The code iterates over each node in the result of the expression [@data.select/*] using [for-each]. For each node, it concatenates the current value of [.conv] with the values of the [prompt] and [completion] nodes from the iterated node, separated by two newline characters, and updates [.conv] with the resulting string using [set-value].
