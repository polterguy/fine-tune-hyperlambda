/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which indicates that it will search for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `.` before "sql" specifies that it should look for this node as a direct child of the current node. This means that the expression is looking for a node named "sql" that is directly under the current node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve SQL query strings or SQL-related configurations stored within a node named "sql" in a Hyperlambda structure.
 * - It might be useful in scenarios where SQL commands or configurations are dynamically constructed or modified within a Hyperlambda script, allowing for easy retrieval and manipulation of SQL-related data.
