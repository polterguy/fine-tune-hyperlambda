// This Hyperlambda code reads data from the "clusters" table, selecting the columns "id", "country", and "name". It applies a filter using a "where" clause to only include rows where the "enabled" column is equal to true. The "and" slot ensures that all specified conditions must be met for a row to be included in the result set.
