/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator searches for the first node named "session" within the current context. It starts from the current node and traverses upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings, until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to access session-related data or configurations that are stored in a node named "session". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving user session data in a web application to check authentication status or user preferences.
 * - Accessing session-specific configurations or settings that are stored in a node named "session".
