/*
 * 1. `@data` - This iterator searches for the first node named "data" in the current context. It is useful when you need to locate a specific node by its name to perform operations on it or its children.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all the children nodes of the "data" node. It allows you to access and manipulate all the direct descendants of the "data" node, which can be useful for iterating over a collection of items or processing multiple nodes at once.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to select and process all items within a "data" node, such as iterating over a list of records or elements to perform batch operations or transformations.
