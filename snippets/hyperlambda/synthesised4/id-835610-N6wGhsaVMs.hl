// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the name of nodes within a specific path in a data connection structure. It targets nodes under [data.connect], specifically within [data.read] and [group], and changes the name of each [group_column] node to the value obtained from the corresponding [group_column] in [.arguments]. The [set-name] slot is used for renaming nodes, and [get-value] retrieves the new name from the arguments provided.
set-name:x:@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/group_column
