// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] construct to handle different cases based on the value of an expression. It allows you to execute specific code blocks depending on the value being evaluated. Each [case] can have any type of value, and is typically followed by a block of code that executes if the case matches the expression's value.
