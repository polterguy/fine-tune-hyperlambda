// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot in Hyperlambda to retrieve the type name of a node's value. The example initializes a node [.foo] with an integer value of 57 and then uses the [type] slot to obtain the type name of the node's value. The [type] slot is invoked with an expression pointing to the node whose type is to be retrieved. After execution, the value of the [type] slot will contain the type name of the node's value, which in this case is "int".
