/*
 * 1. `@.result` - This iterator searches for the first node named "result" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy to find the node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be at a higher level in the node hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "result" node. It is used to access every child node directly under the "result" node, regardless of their names. This is beneficial when you want to perform operations or checks on all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `paths` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to only include those named "paths". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes with a specific name, allowing for targeted operations or data retrieval.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a scenario where you need to extract or manipulate data related to "paths" that are stored as children under a "result" node. For example, in a file processing system, this could be used to retrieve all path-related information from a result set for further processing or validation.
