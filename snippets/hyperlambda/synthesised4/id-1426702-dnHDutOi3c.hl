 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the node [prompt_loss_weight] exists within the [.arguments] node and ensures that its value is not null. If both conditions are true, the [and] slot evaluates to true.

 * 1. [and] - Logical AND operation that evaluates to true only if all its child conditions are true.
 * 2. [exists] - Checks if the node [prompt_loss_weight] exists within the [.arguments] node.
 * 3. [not-null] - Checks if the value of the node [prompt_loss_weight] is not null.
