/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. This is useful for accessing the arguments passed to a function or slot, as arguments are typically organized under an "arguments" node in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node found in the previous step. This is useful for iterating over or accessing any argument nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `defaultValue`: This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to only include nodes named "defaultValue". This is useful for accessing a specific argument named "defaultValue" if it exists among the children of the "arguments" node.
