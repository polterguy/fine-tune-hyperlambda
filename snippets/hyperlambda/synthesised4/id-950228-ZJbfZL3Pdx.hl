// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a substring within a string. It retrieves the "what" and "with" values from the current node's data, using [get-value] to dynamically determine the substring to be replaced and its replacement. The [strings.replace] slot then performs the substitution on the string located at [.result].
strings.replace:x:@.result
   get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/what
   get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/with
