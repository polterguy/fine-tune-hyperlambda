/*
 * 1. `@.outgoing`: This iterator searches for the first node named "outgoing" within the current context. It starts from the current node and traverses upwards through its ancestors and siblings to find the node with the specified name. This iterator is useful when you need to access a specific node that is not a direct child of the current node but exists somewhere in the hierarchy above or alongside it.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving configuration or metadata stored in an "outgoing" node that is shared across different parts of a Hyperlambda script.
 * - Accessing a node that contains information about outgoing network requests or messages, which might be used in a logging or monitoring context.
