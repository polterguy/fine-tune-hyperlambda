// The code concatenates a SQL query string by combining the value of the [.sql] node with additional static strings and a table name. It uses [strings.concat] to append " from ", the table name "campaigns", and a condition " where keyword_count > 0" to the existing SQL string. This constructs a complete SQL query dynamically.
