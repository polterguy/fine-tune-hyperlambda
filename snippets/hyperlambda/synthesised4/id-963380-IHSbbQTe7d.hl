// The code connects to a PostgreSQL database using the [pgsql.connect] slot with the connection string "etl" and executes a SQL command to drop a table named "temp_import" if it exists using the [pgsql.execute] slot. This ensures that any existing "temp_import" table is removed, allowing for a fresh start in subsequent operations.
pgsql.connect:etl
   pgsql.execute:drop table if exists temp_import
