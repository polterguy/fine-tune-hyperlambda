/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by locating the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. This is typically used to access the root node of the arguments passed into a function or an endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access all the parameters or data nodes that are passed as arguments.
 * 
 * 3. `message` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "message". This is used to specifically target a node named "message" within the arguments, which might contain a message string or data relevant to the operation being performed.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a logging function to extract and log a message passed as an argument.
 * - It might be used in a validation routine to check the content of a "message" argument before processing it further.
