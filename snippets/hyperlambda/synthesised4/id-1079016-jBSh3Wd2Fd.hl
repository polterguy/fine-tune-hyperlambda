/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or an HTTP endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument node individually.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `session`. It is used to specifically target the `session` argument within the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access a session argument passed to a Hyperlambda function or an HTTP endpoint, allowing the developer to retrieve session-specific data for further processing or validation.
 * - It can be utilized in scenarios where session management is required, such as maintaining user state or tracking user interactions across multiple requests.
