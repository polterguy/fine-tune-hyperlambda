// 1. `@.template`: This iterator searches for the first node named "template" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it will start the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name within a structured data set, allowing you to retrieve or manipulate its value or children nodes.
