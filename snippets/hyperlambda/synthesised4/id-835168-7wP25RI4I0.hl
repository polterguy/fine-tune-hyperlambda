// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to insert a new record into the "users_extra" table. It uses the [data.create] slot to specify the table and the [values] slot to define the columns and their values. The "user" and "value" fields are populated using the email extracted from the [auth.token.verify] slot, ensuring that the email is verified before insertion. The "type" field is statically set to "email".
data.create
   table:users_extra
   values
      user:x:@auth.token.verify/*/email
      type:email
      value:x:@auth.token.verify/*/email
