/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [yield] slot in Hyperlambda to return a value from a dynamic slot or a file execution. Here, it returns the result of the expression [@strings.builder] and assigns it to the node [dbKey]. This pattern is commonly used to output results from Hyperlambda functions or dynamic slots. 
 * 
 * 1. [yield] - Returns a value or node list from a dynamic slot or file execution.
 * 2. [dbKey] - The node where the result of the expression will be stored.
 * 3. [@strings.builder] - The expression whose result is being returned and stored in [dbKey].
