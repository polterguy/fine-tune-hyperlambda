/*
 * 1. `@data.select` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "data.select". It is used to navigate directly to a specific node within the current context. This is often used when you know the exact node name and want to access it directly.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.select" node. It is useful when you want to process or analyze all child nodes under a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of each node returned by the previous `*` iterator. This allows for a deeper traversal into the hierarchy, accessing grandchildren nodes of the "data.select" node.
 * 
 * 4. `keyword_density` - This iterator filters the nodes retrieved by the previous iterators to only include those with the name "keyword_density". This is useful for extracting specific data points, such as keyword density metrics, from a larger dataset.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Analyzing SEO data where "keyword_density" is a key metric, allowing you to extract and process this information from a structured data set.
 * - Processing content analysis data to evaluate the density of specific keywords within a text corpus, useful for content optimization tasks.
