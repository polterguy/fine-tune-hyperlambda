// This Hyperlambda code connects to a generic "users" database and deletes records from the "users" table where the "id" matches the provided argument. It then yields the number of affected rows from the delete operation. The [data.connect] slot establishes the database connection, [data.delete] specifies the table and condition for deletion, and [yield] returns the result.
data.connect:[generic|users]
