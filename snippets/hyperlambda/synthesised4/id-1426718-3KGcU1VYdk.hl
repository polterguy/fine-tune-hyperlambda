/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the HTTP POST request's status code is between 200 and 299, indicating a successful response. If true, it unwraps a specific part of the response content and adds it to a snippets collection, using a part of the response as the prompt and another part as the completion. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional check.
 * 2. [and] - Combines multiple conditions that must all be true.
 * 3. [mte] - Checks if the HTTP POST status code is greater than or equal to 200.
 * 4. [lt] - Checks if the HTTP POST status code is less than 300.
 * 5. [.lambda] - Executes the following code block if the conditions are true.
 * 6. [unwrap] - Evaluates and unwraps expressions in the specified node.
 * 7. [add] - Adds a new node to the snippets collection.
 * 8. [prompt] - Sets the prompt for the snippet using a specific part of the HTTP response content.
 * 9. [completion] - Sets the completion for the snippet using another part of the response content.
