/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or slot, regardless of their specific names.
 * 
 * 3. `/from` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [from]. It is used to specifically access the [from] argument within the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression is useful for retrieving the value of a specific argument named [from] that has been passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda. It can be used in scenarios where you need to process or validate the [from] argument separately from other arguments.
