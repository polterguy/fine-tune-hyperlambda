/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [arguments] from the current context. In Hyperlambda, the [arguments] node typically contains input parameters or arguments passed to a lambda function or an HTTP endpoint. This iterator is used to access the root of the arguments node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [arguments] node. It is used to access each argument or parameter passed within the [arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `stream` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "stream". It is used to specifically target and retrieve the "stream" argument from the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where a Hyperlambda function or endpoint needs to process or manipulate a specific argument named "stream" passed to it. For example, it might be used to access a data stream for further processing, such as reading from or writing to a stream in a file handling operation.
