/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings but only looks at direct ancestors. This is useful for accessing session-related data or configurations that are stored higher up in the node hierarchy, such as user session information or application state that needs to be accessed from various parts of the application. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving user session data to check authentication status.
 * - Accessing session-specific settings or variables that influence the behavior of the current execution context.
