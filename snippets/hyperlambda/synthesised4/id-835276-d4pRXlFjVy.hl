// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [remove-nodes] slot to delete all child nodes of the nodes returned by the [csv2lambda] slot. The [remove-nodes] slot takes an expression pointing to the nodes to be removed, and in this case, it targets all child nodes within the lambda object generated by converting a CSV string using the [csv2lambda] slot. The expression [@csv2lambda/*/*/] ensures that all second-level child nodes within the converted lambda object are removed, effectively clearing the data while preserving the structure.
remove-nodes:x:@csv2lambda/*/*/
