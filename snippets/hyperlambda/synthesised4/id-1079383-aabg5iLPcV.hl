/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the hierarchy of the current node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is useful for accessing every child node directly beneath the current node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This specific iterator filters the previously retrieved node set to only include nodes with the name "data.read". It is used to specifically target nodes named "data.read" among the children of the parent node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to locate and process all "data.read" nodes that are direct children of the parent node of the current context. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to read or manipulate data from nodes specifically named "data.read" within a certain scope of your Hyperlambda structure.
