/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by selecting the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It uses the `@` symbol to find the node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected "arguments" node. It allows the expression to access any nodes that are direct children of "arguments".
 * 
 * 3. `databaseType`: This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes that have the name "databaseType". It ensures that the expression specifically targets nodes named "databaseType" among the children of "arguments".
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is useful for retrieving the value of a node named "databaseType" that is a child of an "arguments" node. It is typically used in scenarios where you need to dynamically access configuration or parameter values passed into a function or endpoint, specifically focusing on database type information.
