/*
 * The Hyperlambda code uses the [insert-before] slot to insert a node named [group_column] before the first column node within the [columns] node, which is a child of [data.read], itself a child of [data.connect]. This operation allows for dynamically modifying the structure of a Hyperlambda graph by inserting nodes at specific locations. 
 * 
 * 1. [insert-before] - Inserts nodes before the specified node(s) in the expression.
 * 2. [x:@data.connect/*/data.read/*/columns/0] - Expression pointing to the first column node under [columns].
 * 3. [.] - Represents a node with no name, used for grouping child nodes.
 * 4. [group_column] - The node being inserted before the first column node.
