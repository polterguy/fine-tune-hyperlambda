/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument that has been passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `aggregate_function` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "aggregate_function". It is used to specifically target and retrieve the node that contains the aggregate function argument, assuming such a node exists among the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * This expression is useful when you need to access a specific argument named "aggregate_function" that has been passed to a Hyperlambda function or slot, allowing you to perform operations or evaluations based on its value.
