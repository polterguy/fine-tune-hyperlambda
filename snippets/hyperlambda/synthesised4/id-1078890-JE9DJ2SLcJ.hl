/*
 * 1. `@.url` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name [.url] in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further navigation within the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.url] node. It is useful for accessing each individual child node under [.url], allowing for operations to be performed on them.
 * 
 * 3. `{@strings.concat}` - This is an extrapolated expression that evaluates the result of the [strings.concat] slot. It concatenates the values of the nodes retrieved by the previous iterators. This is useful for combining multiple string values into a single string, which can be particularly helpful when constructing URLs or paths from individual components.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Constructing a complete URL from its parts, such as scheme, host, path, and query parameters.
 * - Combining multiple string values into a single string for display or further processing.
