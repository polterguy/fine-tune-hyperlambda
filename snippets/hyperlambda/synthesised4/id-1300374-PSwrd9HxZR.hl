// This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to read data from a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "Customers" table. It begins by specifying the database type as SQLite using the [database-type] slot. The [table] slot is used to indicate the "Customers" table from which the data will be read. Within the [columns] slot, a distinct function is applied through the [distinct_functor] slot, which is then aliased using the [as] slot to an unnamed node represented by a period (.). This setup is likely intended to retrieve distinct values from the specified column(s) in the "Customers" table. The [where] slot is included with an [and] condition, although no specific conditions are defined within it, implying that all records will be considered without additional filtering. Finally, the [return-nodes] slot is used to return all nodes resulting from the [data.read] operation, effectively outputting the data retrieved from the database query. This setup is useful for retrieving unique entries from a database table and returning the results for further processing or display.
