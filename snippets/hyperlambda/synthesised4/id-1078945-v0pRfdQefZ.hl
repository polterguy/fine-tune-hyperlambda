/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It is used to move downwards in the hierarchy to the next node. It ensures that the operation starts from the next node in the sequence.
 * 
 * 2. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access the first level of children nodes from the elder sibling node retrieved by the `+` iterator.
 * 
 * 3. `/*` - This iterator again retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access the second level of children nodes from the nodes retrieved by the previous `/*` iterator.
 * 
 * 4. `/*` - This iterator once more retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access the third level of children nodes from the nodes retrieved by the previous `/*` iterator.
 * 
 * 5. `/content` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "content". It is used to specifically target nodes named "content" at the third level of children from the elder sibling node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to navigate a structured document or data set where you need to access specific content nodes that are nested three levels deep from a particular starting point.
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you are processing a complex hierarchical data structure and need to extract or manipulate content nodes that are deeply nested.
