/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" from the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is another node, and it returns this node by reference.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node returned by the previous iterator. It allows you to access all direct descendants of the de-referenced node.
 * 
 * 4. `\@class` - This iterator retrieves all nodes among the children that have a name of "class". The backslash before the "@" symbol indicates that it is looking for nodes with the specific name "class" among the children nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to find all nodes named "class" within a specific data structure, where ".dp" is a node containing a reference to another node structure. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or manipulate nodes with the name "class" for further operations, such as applying styles or extracting class-related information.
