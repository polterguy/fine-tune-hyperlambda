/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate upwards in the hierarchy of nodes.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all direct children of the parent node.
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "data.read". It is used to specifically target nodes that are named "data.read" among the children of the parent node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to find and process all "data.read" nodes that are direct children of the parent node, which might be useful in scenarios where you need to read data from multiple sources or configurations in a structured way.
