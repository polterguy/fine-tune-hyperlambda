// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.select] slot to execute a SQL query on a PostgreSQL database. It retrieves the order_id, user_id, and total from the "orders" table where the order_status is 'shipped', ordering the results by order_date in descending order, and limits the output to 30 records. The [database-type] is specified as "pgsql" to ensure the correct SQL dialect is used.
data.select:"select order_id, user_id, total from orders where order_status='shipped' order by order_date desc limit 30"
   database-type:pgsql
