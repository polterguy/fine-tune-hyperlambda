/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to locate the [.arguments] node in the hierarchy, which typically contains input parameters or arguments for a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access the individual argument nodes that are children of the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `[0,2]`: This iterator retrieves a subset of the previous result set, specifically the first two nodes. The first number (0) indicates the starting index, and the second number (2) indicates the number of nodes to retrieve. This is useful for selecting a specific range of nodes from a larger set, such as the first two arguments in a list of parameters.
