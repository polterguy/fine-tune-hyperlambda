/*
 * 1. `+` - Retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node. This iterator is used to move downwards in the hierarchy, one node at a time.
 * 2. `+` - Again, retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node. This continues the downward traversal.
 * 3. `+` - Once more, retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node. This completes the three-step downward traversal.
 * 4. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the current node. This is used to access the children of the node reached after the downward traversal.
 * 5. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the current node again. This is used to further access the children of the previous node's children.
 * 6. `.sse` - Retrieves the first child node with the name `.sse`. This is used to filter the node set to only include nodes named `.sse`.
 * 7. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the current `.sse` node. This accesses the children of the `.sse` node.
 * 8. `.user-id` - Retrieves the first child node with the name `.user-id`. This filters the node set to only include nodes named `.user-id`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to navigate through a structured data set where you need to access user IDs stored under a specific hierarchy. 
 * - It might be useful in a scenario where you are processing a list of events or sessions (`.sse`) and need to extract user identifiers for further processing or analysis.
