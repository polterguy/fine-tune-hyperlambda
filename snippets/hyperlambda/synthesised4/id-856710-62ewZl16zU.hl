/*
 * The Hyperlambda code sets the value of the current node to the count of child nodes under [endpoints.list]. It uses [set-value] to assign the result of [get-count], which counts the number of nodes referenced by its expression. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the current node.
 * 2. [get-count] - Returns the number of nodes under [endpoints.list].
