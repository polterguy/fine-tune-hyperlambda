 * 1. `@.tmp`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "tmp" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "tmp" node it encounters. 
 * 
 * Use case: This expression can be used to retrieve a specific configuration or temporary data node that is defined higher up in the hierarchy, allowing you to access shared or global data within a larger Hyperlambda structure.
