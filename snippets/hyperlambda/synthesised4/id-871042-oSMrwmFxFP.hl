// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to concatenate strings to form a SQL query. It uses the [set-value] slot to assign a concatenated string to the [.sql] node. The [strings.concat] slot combines a static string "show create table " with a dynamic value retrieved using [get-value] from the [.dp] node, which is passed by reference. This construction is useful for dynamically generating SQL queries based on runtime data.
set-value:x:@.sql
   strings.concat
      .:"show create table "
      get-value:x:@.dp/#
