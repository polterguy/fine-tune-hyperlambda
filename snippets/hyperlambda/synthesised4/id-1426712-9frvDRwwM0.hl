/*
 * The Hyperlambda code snippet dynamically adds nodes into the [.session] node. It appends a structure containing a [role] node with the value "assistant" and a [content] node. The [content] node's value is set by retrieving the value of the [prompt] node, which is a child of the current node being iterated by reference, indicated by [.dp]. This structure is added as a child to the [.session] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds nodes into a specified destination node.
 * 2. [.] - Creates an anonymous node to encapsulate the structure being added.
 * 3. [.] - Another anonymous node to further encapsulate the structure.
 * 4. [role] - Sets the role to "assistant".
 * 5. [content] - Sets the content by retrieving the value of the [prompt] node from the current node being iterated.
