/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current node's context. It is used to access the [.arguments] node, which is typically used to pass arguments to a Hyperlambda slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are children of [.arguments].
 * 
 * 3. `system_message` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "system_message". It is used to specifically access the "system_message" node among the children of [.arguments].
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda slot or endpoint to retrieve a specific system message passed as an argument, allowing the logic to process or respond to it accordingly.
 * - It could be used to log or display a system message in a user interface, or to trigger specific actions based on the content of the system message.
