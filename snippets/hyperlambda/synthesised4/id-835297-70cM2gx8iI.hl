 * Sets the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.type] to the static string "bool". This operation is useful for dynamically changing the type or state of a node within a Hyperlambda graph, allowing for flexible data manipulation and transformation. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [@.type] - Expression pointing to the node whose value is to be changed.
 * 3. [.] - Static value "bool" to set as the new value of the node.
