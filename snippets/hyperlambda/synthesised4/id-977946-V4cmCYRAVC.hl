// The code snippet demonstrates how to add records from a database query to a node named [contacts]. It uses the [data.select] slot to execute a SQL query that selects all records from the "client_contacts" table. The results of this query are then added to the [contacts] node using the [add] slot.
add:x:@.contacts
   data.select:select * from client_contacts
