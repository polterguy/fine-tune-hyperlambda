// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [and] slot to combine multiple conditions or expressions. The [habitat] node is likely part of a larger logical structure where multiple conditions are evaluated together, and the [and] slot ensures that all conditions must be true for the overall expression to be true. The [habitat] node specifies a condition related to a "Coral Reef" environment.
