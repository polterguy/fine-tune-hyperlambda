/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the root node of the arguments passed to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. This is useful for accessing any data or parameters that have been passed as part of the arguments.
 * 
 * 3. `data`: This filters the result set to only include nodes named "data" among the children of the "arguments" node. This is useful when you specifically want to access a node named "data" that is expected to be part of the arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression is useful in a scenario where a function or slot is designed to process or manipulate data passed to it as part of its arguments. By using this expression, the function can directly access the "data" node and perform the necessary operations on it.
