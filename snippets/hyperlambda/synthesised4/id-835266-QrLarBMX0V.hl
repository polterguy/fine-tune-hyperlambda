// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node it's referenced in is reached, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, [unwrap] is used to evaluate the expression [x:+] before the [.dest] node is reached, ensuring that [.dest] has the evaluated value from [.src].
