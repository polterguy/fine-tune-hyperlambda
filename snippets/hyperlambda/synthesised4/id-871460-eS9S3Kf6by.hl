// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a left join between the "leads" and "clients" tables in an SQLite database. It uses the [data.read] slot to specify the database type and table, and the [join] slot to define the join condition. The [columns] slot specifies the columns to be selected, using a distinct functor with an alias. The [where] slot is prepared for additional conditions to filter the results.
