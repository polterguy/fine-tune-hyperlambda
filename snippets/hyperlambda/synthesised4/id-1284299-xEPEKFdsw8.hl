// The expression `unwrap:x:+/*` is used to forward evaluate all child nodes of the current node's elder sibling. The `+` iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node, and the `/*` iterator retrieves all of its children. This is useful when you need to evaluate or process all child nodes of the elder sibling node before proceeding with the current node's execution. A potential use case for this expression could be when you have a sequence of operations or transformations that need to be applied to a set of nodes, and you want to ensure that all these operations are completed before moving on to the next step in your logic.
