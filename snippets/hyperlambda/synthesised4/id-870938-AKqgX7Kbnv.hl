/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is part of a switch-case structure where it handles a case labeled "double". It converts the value of the current node (referenced by [.dp]) to a type specified dynamically. The type is determined by navigating through the node hierarchy to find the type node within the action's arguments. The conversion is then applied to the current node's value using [convert]. 
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Defines a case in a switch-case structure labeled "double".
 * 2. [set-value] - Sets the value of the current node referenced by [.dp].
 * 3. [convert] - Converts the value of the current node to a specified type.
 * 4. [type] - Specifies the type to convert to, determined dynamically from the action's arguments.
