/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [else] slot to execute a block of code if none of the preceding conditions are met. It sets the value of the [.prompt] node to the value retrieved from the [.only-prompt] node. The [else] slot ensures that this action is taken as a default or fallback when other conditional checks fail. 
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes the following block if no previous conditions are true.
 * 2. [set-value] - Changes the value of the specified node.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the specified node.
