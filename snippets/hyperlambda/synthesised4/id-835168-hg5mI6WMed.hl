// The code snippet demonstrates how to create a new record in the "users" table using the [data.create] slot. It sets the "username" field to the email extracted from a verified authentication token and assigns a static value "openid-connect" to the "password" field. This ensures that user data is securely inserted into the database.
data.create
   table:users
   values
      username:x:@auth.token.verify/*/email
