/*
 * This Hyperlambda code connects to a CRM database and attempts to delete users with a "pending" status within a transaction. It simulates a failure using [throw], which triggers the [.catch] block to roll back the transaction and log an error message. The transaction is not committed due to the simulated failure, ensuring data integrity by rolling back changes. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.connect] - Establishes a connection to the CRM database.
 * 2. [try] - Begins a block to attempt executing its child nodes.
 * 3. [data.transaction.create] - Initiates a database transaction.
 * 4. [data.execute] - Executes a SQL command to delete users with a "pending" status.
 * 5. [throw] - Simulates a failure to trigger the catch block.
 * 6. [data.transaction.commit] - Would commit the transaction if reached.
 * 7. [.catch] - Handles exceptions, executing its child nodes if an error occurs.
 * 8. [data.transaction.rollback] - Rolls back the transaction to undo changes.
 * 9. [log.error] - Logs an error message indicating the transaction failed and was rolled back.
