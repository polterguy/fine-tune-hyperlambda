/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is useful when you need to access nodes from the very top of the hierarchy, regardless of your current position within the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children nodes of the root node. This is useful for iterating over or accessing all direct descendants of a particular node.
 * 
 * 3. `http.xxx` - This retrieves the first node with the name "http.xxx" among the children nodes of the root node. It is used to specifically target nodes related to HTTP operations or configurations that are named "http.xxx".
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this retrieves all children nodes of the "http.xxx" node. This allows access to all direct descendants of the "http.xxx" node, which could include various HTTP-related settings or data.
 * 
 * 5. `headers` - This retrieves the node named "headers" among the children of the "http.xxx" node. It is typically used to access HTTP headers, which are key-value pairs sent and received in HTTP requests and responses.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing and manipulating HTTP headers for a request or response in a web application.
 * - Logging or debugging HTTP headers for monitoring network traffic or diagnosing issues.
 * - Configuring custom headers for API requests to include authentication tokens or other metadata.
