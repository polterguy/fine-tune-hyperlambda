// The [unwrap] slot in this code is used to forward evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. The expression "x:+/*/*/*" indicates a traversal through nodes, and the [unwrap] slot will evaluate these nodes' expressions, potentially modifying their values or structure before the execution of the subsequent nodes. This is useful for preparing or transforming data dynamically within a Hyperlambda graph.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*
