// The code snippet demonstrates how to perform an inner join between two tables, "cloudlets" and "plans", using the [join] slot. The join condition specified ensures that the "plan" field in the "cloudlets" table matches the "name" field in the "plans" table. This setup is useful for retrieving related data from both tables based on the specified condition. The [type] slot indicates that an inner join is being performed.
