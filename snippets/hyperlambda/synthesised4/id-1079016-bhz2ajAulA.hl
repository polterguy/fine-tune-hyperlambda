/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It is used to locate the [.arguments] node, which is typically used to define or access the arguments passed into a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access all the arguments provided within the [.arguments] node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `/message` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to return only those with the name "message". It is used to specifically access the "message" argument within the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or endpoint to extract the value of a "message" argument passed into a function or HTTP request.
 * - It can be useful in logging or debugging scenarios where you need to access and log a specific message passed as an argument.
