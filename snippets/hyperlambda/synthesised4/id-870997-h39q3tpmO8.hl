// This Hyperlambda code reads data from the "ml_training_snippets" table, applying a filter to select records where the "prompt" and "completion" fields match the current node values, and the "type" field matches the provided argument. The [data.read] slot is used to query the database, and the [where] clause specifies the conditions for selecting records.
