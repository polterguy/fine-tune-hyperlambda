/*
 * 1. `@crypto.rsa.create-key`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "crypto.rsa.create-key" from the current context. It starts the expression by locating this specific node, which is likely to contain information or operations related to RSA key creation.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "crypto.rsa.create-key" node. It allows access to any data or configurations that are nested directly under the RSA key creation node, which might include both public and private key details or other related parameters.
 * 
 * 3. `public`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "public" from the previously retrieved children nodes. This is used to specifically access the public key or any information labeled as "public" within the RSA key creation context.
