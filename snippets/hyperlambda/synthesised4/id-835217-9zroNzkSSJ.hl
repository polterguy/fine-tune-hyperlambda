// This Hyperlambda code checks if a folder named "cache" in the "/etc" directory does not exist using [io.folder.exists]. If the folder is absent, it creates the "cache" folder using [io.folder.create]. The [not] slot inverts the condition, ensuring the folder is created only if it doesn't already exist.
