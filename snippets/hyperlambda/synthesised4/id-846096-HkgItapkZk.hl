// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specific substring within a string. It targets the substring "[[button]]" within the value of the [.result] node and replaces it with the first value retrieved from the [button] node inside [.arguments]. The [get-first-value] slot is used to ensure that only the first value of the [button] node is used for the replacement.
strings.replace:x:@.result
   .:[[button]]

      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/button
