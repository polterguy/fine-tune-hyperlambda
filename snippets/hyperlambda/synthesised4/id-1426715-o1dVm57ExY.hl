// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.model/*/max_request_tokens] node to the result obtained from a [math.divide] operation. The [set-value] slot is used to assign a new value to a specified node, and in this case, it assigns the result of a division operation, which is retrieved using the [get-value] slot pointing to the [math.divide] node.
