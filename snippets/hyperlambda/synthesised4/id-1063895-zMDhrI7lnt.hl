// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol signifies that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that it starts the search from the current node's level, not traversing into children nodes. This is useful when you need to directly access a specific node by its name at the current level, such as retrieving a SQL query or command stored in a node named "sql".
