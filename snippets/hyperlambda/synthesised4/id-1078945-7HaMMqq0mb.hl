/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves to the next node below in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access the next sibling node in a sequence of nodes.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access the entire set of children nodes under a particular node, allowing for operations or evaluations on all of them.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to navigate from a current node to its next sibling and then access all children of that sibling. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or evaluate data from a specific section of a hierarchical structure, such as processing all items in a list that follows a particular node.
