// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database and inserts a new record into the "users" table. It uses the [data.connect] slot to establish a connection to the database named "magic", and the [data.create] slot to insert a new record. The [table] node specifies the table name, and the [values] node contains the fields "username", "email", and "age", which are populated with values from the [.arguments] node. This ensures that the data is dynamically inserted based on the provided arguments.
