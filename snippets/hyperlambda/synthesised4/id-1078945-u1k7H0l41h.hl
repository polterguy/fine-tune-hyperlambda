/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate upwards in the hierarchy to access the parent node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children of the parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `return` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "return". It is used to find specific nodes that match this name among the children of the parent node.
 * 
 * 4. `**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the previous result set, including the node itself, using a "breadth-first" algorithm. It is used to explore all levels of the hierarchy below the "return" nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to gather all descendant nodes of "return" nodes within a specific parent node, which might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze data associated with "return" nodes in a hierarchical structure.
