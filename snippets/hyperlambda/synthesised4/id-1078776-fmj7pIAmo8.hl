/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful for navigating up one level in the node hierarchy.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is useful for iterating over all direct descendants.
 * 3. `whitelist` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "whitelist". It is useful for narrowing down the node set to specific named nodes.
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current "whitelist" node. It allows for further exploration of the node hierarchy under the "whitelist" node.
 * 5. `vocabulary` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "vocabulary". It is useful for accessing specific nodes within the "whitelist" hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve all "vocabulary" nodes that are descendants of a "whitelist" node, which is itself a child of the current node's parent. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to access or manipulate vocabulary data that is organized under a whitelist structure.
