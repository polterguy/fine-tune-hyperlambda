// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [is_nullable] node, which is a child of the node referenced by [.dp], is equal to "NO". If the condition is true, it implies that the [is_nullable] node's value is exactly "NO". The [eq] slot is used for this equality comparison, and the [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node for comparison.
