/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or a slot, especially in the context of HTTP endpoints or dynamic slots.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access all the parameters or arguments provided within the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `/pkName` - This iterator filters the children nodes retrieved by the `*` iterator to find the node named `pkName`. It is used to specifically access the value of the `pkName` argument, which might represent a primary key name in a database-related operation.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function or HTTP endpoint to retrieve the value of a primary key name passed as an argument, which could then be used for database queries or operations.
 * - It could also be used in a validation routine to ensure that a required primary key name is provided before proceeding with further logic.
