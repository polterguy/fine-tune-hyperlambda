// 1. `-`: This iterator retrieves the previous node or the node above it in the Hyperlambda structure. It is used to navigate to the younger sibling of the current node, allowing you to access nodes that are directly preceding the current node in the hierarchy. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to reference or manipulate a node that is immediately before the current node in the sequence.
