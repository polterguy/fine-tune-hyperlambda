/*
 * The provided code demonstrates how to split a string into multiple parts and then join them back together with a comma as a separator. The [strings.split] slot is used to divide the string into parts, and the [strings.join] slot concatenates these parts with a comma in between each part. This process effectively transforms a space-separated string into a comma-separated string. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.split] - Splits the input string into multiple parts based on spaces.
 * 2. [strings.join] - Joins the split parts back together with a comma as a separator.
