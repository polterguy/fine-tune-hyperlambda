// Retrieves the value of the first [.dp] node it finds upwards in the hierarchy, assuming the value is a node by itself, and returns this node by reference. This is useful for directly accessing and modifying the original node's value, such as when iterating through nodes with [for-each] and needing to change the value of the current node being iterated.
