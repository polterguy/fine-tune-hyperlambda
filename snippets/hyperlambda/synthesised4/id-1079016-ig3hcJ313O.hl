/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "new-prompt" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first occurrence of a node named "new-prompt" that it encounters. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve a specific configuration or setting node named "new-prompt" that might be defined higher up in the hierarchy, allowing for dynamic adjustments based on context.
 * - It could also be used in a scenario where "new-prompt" nodes are used to store temporary data or flags that need to be accessed from various points in the Hyperlambda structure.
