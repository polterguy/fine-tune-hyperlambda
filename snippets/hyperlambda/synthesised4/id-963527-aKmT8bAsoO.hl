// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to construct a SQL query for a SQLite database. It specifies the table "city" and selects a distinct column with an alias "count". The [where] clause is initialized with an [and] condition for further filtering. This setup allows for querying distinct values from the "city" table with potential conditions applied.
