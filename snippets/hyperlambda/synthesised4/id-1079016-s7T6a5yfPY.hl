/*
 * 1. `@json2lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context with the name "json2lambda". It is used to locate a specific node by its name within the current node hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "json2lambda" node. It allows you to access every child node directly beneath the "json2lambda" node.
 * 
 * 3. `done` - This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes named "done" among the children of the "json2lambda" node. It is used to pinpoint nodes with a specific name within the children of the previously identified node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to check if a process or task represented by the "json2lambda" node has been marked as completed by looking for a "done" node among its children.
 * - It could be used in a logging or monitoring system to verify the completion status of tasks or operations that are structured in a JSON-like format within a Hyperlambda application.
