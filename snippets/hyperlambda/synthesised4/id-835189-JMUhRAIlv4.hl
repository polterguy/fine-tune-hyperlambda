// The [case] slot is used within a [switch] construct to define a specific condition or value that, if matched, will trigger the execution of its associated lambda object. The [case] node must have a value, either a constant or an expression, and is used to compare against the value provided to the [switch] slot. If the [switch] value matches the [case] value, the code within the [case] node is executed.
