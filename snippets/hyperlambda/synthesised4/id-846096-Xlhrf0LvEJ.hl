// The code snippet uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of the string "[[animation]]" within the node pointed to by the expression [@.result] with the value retrieved from the [animation] argument in [.arguments]. The [get-value] slot is used to fetch the value of the [animation] argument, which is then used as the replacement string.
