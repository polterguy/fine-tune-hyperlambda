// This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database named "cms" using a generic connection string. It adds nodes from the [.arguments] node to the [where] clause of a [data.delete] operation on the "categories" table. Finally, it yields the number of affected rows from the delete operation. The [add] slot is used to dynamically construct the [where] clause based on input arguments.
