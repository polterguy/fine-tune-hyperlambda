// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each child node of [stats] under [input], retrieves the name of the current node, and sets the value of a corresponding node in [output] with the same name. The [for-each] slot iterates through nodes, [get-name] retrieves the name of the current node, and [set-value] assigns the value from the current node in [input] to the corresponding node in [output].
