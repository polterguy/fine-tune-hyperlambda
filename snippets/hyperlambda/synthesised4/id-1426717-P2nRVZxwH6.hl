/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [context] slot to store a value on the stack, which can later be retrieved using the [get-context] slot. The [context] slot is used to add an object to the stack with a specified name and value, along with a [.lambda] block where the context is accessible. The [get-context] slot is then used within the [.lambda] block to retrieve the stored value. This approach is useful for maintaining data accessibility throughout the execution of a Hyperlambda snippet without passing it as an argument to slots. The code also includes an example of using the [context] slot to store a SignalR connectionId as a context object, demonstrating how to manage group associations for a connection.
 * 
 * 1. [result] - Declares a node to store the result of the operation.
 * 2. [context] - Adds an object to the stack with a specified name and value.
 * 3. [value] - Specifies the value to be stored in the context.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Defines a block where the context object is accessible.
 * 5. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [result] node to the retrieved context value.
 * 6. [get-context] - Retrieves the context object with the specified name from the stack.
