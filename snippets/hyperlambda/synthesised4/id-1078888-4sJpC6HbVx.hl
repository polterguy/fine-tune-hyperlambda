/*
 * 1. `@.markdown`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "markdown" that is at the same level or higher in the hierarchy relative to the current node. It uses the `@` symbol to search for the node by name, and the `.` indicates that it should start the search from the current node's level and move upwards if necessary. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access or manipulate a node named "markdown" that is defined somewhere in the hierarchy of your Hyperlambda code. For example, it might be used to retrieve markdown content for processing or rendering in a web application.
