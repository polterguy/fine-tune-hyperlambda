// This Hyperlambda code snippet performs a SQL query to select specific columns from the "film" and "actor" tables, joining them through the "film_actor" table using inner joins. The query retrieves the title and description of films along with the last and first names of actors, filtering results to only include actors with the first name "NICK". The [mysql.read] slot is used to execute the query, and the [join] slots specify the relationships between tables. The [where] slot filters the results based on the actor's first name.
