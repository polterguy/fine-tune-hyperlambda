/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "signal" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "signal" node. It does not filter by name, so it includes all direct children.
 * 
 * 3. `snippets` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to only include those with the name "snippets". It narrows down the result set to nodes specifically named "snippets".
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This final iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "snippets" nodes. It includes all direct children of each "snippets" node found in the previous step.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to gather all code snippets or similar data structures within a "signal" node, which might be part of a larger configuration or data processing structure.
 * - It could be useful in a system where "signal" nodes represent events or messages, and "snippets" contain associated metadata or actions to be performed.
