/*
 * 1. `@cache` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "cache" in the current node's hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards, checking each node's name to find a match. This is useful for accessing a specific node that might be defined earlier in the hierarchy, such as a configuration or a cached value node.
 * 
 * 2. `get` - This part of the expression is looking for a child node named "get" within the node that was found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the "cache" node has a child named "get". This is typically used to retrieve a specific operation or value associated with the "cache" node, such as retrieving a cached item.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - Accessing a cached value in a Hyperlambda script where the "cache" node contains various cache-related operations or values.
 * - Retrieving a specific cache operation or configuration that is defined earlier in the script or in a parent node, allowing for modular and reusable code.
