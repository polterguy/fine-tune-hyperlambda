// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] block to handle specific cases based on the value of an expression. The [case] slot allows you to define actions or logic that should be executed when a particular condition is met. In this example, the [case] slot is used with a value of "bigserial", which could be part of a larger decision-making process where different actions are taken based on different input values.
