/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before in its hierarchy that matches the given name, which in this case is "tmp". It searches for a node named "tmp" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to access a specific ancestor node by name, regardless of its position in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to quickly access a configuration or context node named "tmp" that is defined higher up in the hierarchy, allowing you to retrieve or manipulate its value or children nodes.
