// 1. `@.reset-email`: This iterator searches for the first node named "reset-email" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and traversing upwards through its ancestors and siblings. This type of iterator is useful when you need to access a specific node by name that might not be a direct child of the current node, allowing you to reference nodes that are higher up in the hierarchy or at the same level but declared earlier in the Hyperlambda structure.
