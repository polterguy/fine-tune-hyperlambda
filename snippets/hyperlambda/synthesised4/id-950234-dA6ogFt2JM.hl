// The [and] slot evaluates multiple conditions and returns true only if all conditions are true. It takes two or more arguments, evaluating each to determine their truth value. If any condition evaluates to false, [and] short-circuits and returns false without evaluating further conditions. This slot is useful for combining multiple logical conditions in a single evaluation.
