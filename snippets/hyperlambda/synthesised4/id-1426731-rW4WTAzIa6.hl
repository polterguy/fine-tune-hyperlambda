/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the number of child nodes under the [urls] node is less than 10,000. It uses the [get-count] slot to count the nodes and the [lt] slot to perform the comparison. 
 * 
 * 1. [lt] - Compares two values and returns true if the first is less than the second.
 * 2. [get-count:x:@.urls/*] - Counts the number of child nodes under the [urls] node.
 * 3. [.:int:10000] - The integer value 10,000 used as the comparison threshold.
