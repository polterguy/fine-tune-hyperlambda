// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of nodes found in a specific path to a concatenated string that includes a SQL-like "count(distinct ...)" expression. It uses [set-name] to target nodes, [strings.concat] to build the expression, and [get-value] to insert the value of [distinct_column] into the expression.
