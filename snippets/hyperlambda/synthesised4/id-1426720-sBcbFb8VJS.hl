// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database using a generic or magic connection and executes a SQL query to select specific columns from the "ml_training_snippets" table. It filters the results based on the "type" and "id" parameters, ensuring that the "embedding" column is null, and orders the results by "id", limiting the output to 20 records. The query parameters "type" and "id" are dynamically set using values from the arguments and the current context.
data.connect:[generic|magic]
   add:x:@.data
      data.select:@"
select id, prompt, completion
   from ml_training_snippets
   where type = @type and id > @id and embedding is null order by id limit 20"
         type:x:@.arguments/*/type
         id:x:@.id
