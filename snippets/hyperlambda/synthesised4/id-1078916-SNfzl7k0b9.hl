/*
 * - `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by locating the first node named `.arguments` within the current context. It searches through the hierarchy to find this node, which is typically used to define the arguments or parameters for a function or operation in Hyperlambda. 
 * - `*`: This iterator retrieves all the children of the `.arguments` node. It allows access to any nodes that are directly nested under `.arguments`, which could represent individual argument values or configurations.
 * - `animation`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `animation` among the children of `.arguments`. It specifically targets nodes that are intended to hold or represent animation-related data or settings.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * 1. This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda script to access and manipulate animation settings or parameters passed to a function, allowing for dynamic adjustments or processing of animations.
 * 2. It might be used in a system that processes multimedia content, where specific animation parameters need to be extracted and utilized for rendering or transformation purposes.
