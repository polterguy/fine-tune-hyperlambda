// The Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [magic.io.file.load-recursively] slot to load all files recursively within a specified folder, returning their filenames and content. This operation is useful for tasks such as generating frontend applications based on templates or downloading a folder. The code specifies the folder path using an expression pointing to a node by reference.
