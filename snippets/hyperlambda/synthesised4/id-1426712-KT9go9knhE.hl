// The Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and forward the expressions specified in its value before the node where it's referenced is reached. The expression "x:+/*/*" is used to navigate through the node structure, and the [unwrap] slot ensures that the expressions are evaluated beforehand, allowing the resulting values to be used in subsequent operations or assignments. This is particularly useful for preparing data or expressions for later use in the Hyperlambda execution flow.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
