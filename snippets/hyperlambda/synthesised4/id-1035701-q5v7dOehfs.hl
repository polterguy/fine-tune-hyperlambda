/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current hierarchy, starting from the current node and moving upwards if necessary. It's typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each individual argument node that is a direct child of `.arguments`.
 * 
 * 3. `city_id` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `city_id` among the children of `.arguments`. It is used to specifically target the `city_id` argument, assuming it is passed as part of the arguments.
