/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet dynamically adds nodes to a destination node specified by the expression. It appends a new node structure to the [.session] node, where the inner node contains a [role] node with the value "user" and a [content] node. The [content] node's value is set to the value of the [completion] node found within the currently iterated node, referenced by [.dp]. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds nodes to the specified destination node.
 * 2. [.] - Represents a new node structure to be added.
 * 3. [role] - Sets the role of the user.
 * 4. [content] - Sets the content value from the [completion] node of the iterated node.
