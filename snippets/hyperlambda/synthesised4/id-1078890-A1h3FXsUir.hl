/*
 * 1. `@strings.trim-end` - This iterator is used to locate the first node in the current context that has the name "strings.trim-end". It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to apply the `strings.trim-end` operation to a specific node within a larger Hyperlambda structure, ensuring that the operation is applied to the correct node without needing to specify an absolute path.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Removing trailing whitespace from a string value stored in a node named "strings.trim-end".
 * - Ensuring that a string value does not have unnecessary spaces at the end before performing further operations or comparisons.
