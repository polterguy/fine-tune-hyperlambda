// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert a node structure at a specific location in a Hyperlambda graph. It targets the [return] node within a [try] block and adds a [sitemap] node with a value derived from a [strings.concat] operation. This allows for dynamic modification of the graph by appending new nodes with computed values.
