// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [filename] node by concatenating a static file path with a dynamic file name. It uses [set-value] to assign the result of [strings.concat], which combines the static path "/etc/www/assets/images/" with the dynamic name obtained from [get-value] pointing to the [name] node within the [file] node under [.arguments].
