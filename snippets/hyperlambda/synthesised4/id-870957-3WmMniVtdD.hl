// This Hyperlambda snippet retrieves the value of the [module_name] node from the result of a [hyper2lambda] conversion and sets it as the value for the [.module-name] node. The [set-value] slot is used to assign the retrieved value, while [get-value] accesses the specific node within the converted lambda structure.
