// This Hyperlambda code snippet converts the result of an HTTP GET request into a Hyperlambda string using the [lambda2hyper] slot. The [http.get] slot is used to perform the HTTP GET request, and the result is passed to [lambda2hyper] to create a Hyperlambda representation of the response. The code effectively transforms the HTTP response into a Hyperlambda format, which can be used for further processing or storage.
