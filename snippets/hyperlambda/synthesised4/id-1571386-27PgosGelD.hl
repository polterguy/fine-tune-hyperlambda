 * 1. `+` — Selects the next sibling node (the node immediately below the current node at the same indentation level).
 * 2. `*` — Retrieves all children of the previously selected node.
 * 3. `*` — Retrieves all children of each node returned by the previous step (i.e., the grandchildren of the node selected by `+`).
 * 4. `.sse` — Filters and returns only the nodes named [.sse] among the grandchildren.
 * 5. `*` — Retrieves all children of each [.sse] node.
 * 6. `.session` — Filters and returns only the nodes named [.session] among the children of [.sse] nodes.
 * 
 * This expression navigates from the current node to its next sibling, then drills down two levels to find all [.sse] nodes, and finally selects all [.session] nodes that are children of those [.sse] nodes.
