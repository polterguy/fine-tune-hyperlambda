/*
 * 1. `@config.get`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "config.get" from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy until it finds a match. This is useful for accessing configuration settings or parameters that have been previously defined in the Hyperlambda graph. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access a configuration setting or parameter that has been defined elsewhere in the Hyperlambda structure, such as retrieving a database connection string or an API key.
