// The provided Hyperlambda code iterates over each match found in a string using [for-each], unwrapping and adding each match to an [emails] node. The [for-each] slot iterates through the matches, [unwrap] evaluates the current match, and [add] appends the evaluated match to the [emails] node. This process is useful for extracting and organizing specific data from a string into a structured format.
