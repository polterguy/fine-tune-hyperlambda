/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any nodes that are directly under the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `offset` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "offset" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target the "offset" argument within the arguments list.
