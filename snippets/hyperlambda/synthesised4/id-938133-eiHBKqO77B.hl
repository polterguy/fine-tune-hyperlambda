// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [age] node in [.arguments] is greater than 18 using the [mt] slot. If true, it executes the [.lambda] block, which uses [yield] to return a node named [allowed] with a boolean value of true. The code effectively determines if an age is above a certain threshold and returns a permission status based on that condition.
