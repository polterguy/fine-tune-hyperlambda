// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each child node of [.errors] using the [for-each] slot. For each node, it logs the value of the node using [log.info], with [.dp] referencing the current node being iterated. The [for-each] slot allows for processing each node in a collection, while [log.info] records information for debugging or monitoring purposes.
