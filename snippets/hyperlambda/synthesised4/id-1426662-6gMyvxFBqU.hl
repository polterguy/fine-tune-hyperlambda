 * // This Hyperlambda code adds a new node under the [add] slot, which is a child of the [lambda] node. The path specified in the expression points to a sequence of nodes, and the [log.timeshift] slot is used to log the message "Lead was generated". This effectively logs an event whenever a lead is generated, allowing for tracking or auditing purposes.
 * // 1. [add] - Adds a new node to the specified path.
 * // 2. [log.timeshift] - Logs the message "Lead was generated".
