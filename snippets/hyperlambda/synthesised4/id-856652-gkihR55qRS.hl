// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [case] slot to evaluate a boolean condition. If the condition is true, it sets the value of the node located at the expression [.arg/*/schema/*/type] to "boolean" using the [set-value] slot. The [case] slot is typically used within a [switch] construct to handle specific cases based on the value of a node or expression.
case:bool
