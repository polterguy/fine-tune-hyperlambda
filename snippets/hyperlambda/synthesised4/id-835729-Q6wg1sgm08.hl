// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to update records in a SQLite database using the [data.update] slot. It specifies the database type as SQLite and targets the "Appointments" table. The [values] node would typically contain the columns and their new values to update, while the [where] node, combined with the [and] logical condition, defines the criteria for selecting which records to update. This ensures that only specific records meeting the given conditions are modified.
