// 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name, in this case, "http.post". It starts searching from the current node and looks through its siblings and ancestors. This iterator is useful for accessing specific nodes when you know their names but not their exact location in the hierarchy. It is commonly used to access configuration or data nodes that are defined elsewhere in the Hyperlambda structure.
