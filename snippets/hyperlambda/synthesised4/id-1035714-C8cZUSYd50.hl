/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` in the current hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a Hyperlambda slot or function, as arguments are conventionally stored under an `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any direct child nodes under `.arguments`, which in this context would be individual argument nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `InvoiceLineId` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `InvoiceLineId`. It is used to specifically target the `InvoiceLineId` node among the children of `.arguments`, allowing the expression to focus on this particular piece of data.
