// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the [max_tokens] node, which is a child of the [model] node. The [get-value] slot is used to access the value of a specific node within the current node structure, as specified by the expression. The expression `x:@.model/*/max_tokens` navigates to the [max_tokens] node under the [model] node and retrieves its value.
