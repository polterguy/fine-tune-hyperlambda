/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It is used to access the arguments node which typically contains parameters or inputs for a function or operation.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any parameter nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `limit` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "limit". It is used to specifically target the "limit" parameter within the arguments, which might be used to define a boundary or restriction in the operation being performed.
