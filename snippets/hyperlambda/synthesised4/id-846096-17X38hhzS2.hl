// This code snippet updates the value of the [.result] node by replacing occurrences of the string "[[theme]]" with a new value. The replacement value is determined by the [get-first-value] slot, which checks for a "theme" argument in [.arguments] and defaults to "modern" if not found. The [strings.replace] slot performs the string substitution within the [.result] node.
