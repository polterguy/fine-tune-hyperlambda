/*
 * 1. `@.session` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `.session` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` indicates it starts from the current node's context.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.session` node found in the previous step. The `*` symbol is used to access all direct children nodes.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * 
 * - This expression can be used to access and manipulate all session-related data stored under a `.session` node, such as user information or session variables in a web application.
 * - It could be used in a logging or debugging scenario to iterate over and display all session data for analysis.
