/*
 * 1. `@.reference`: This iterator searches for the first node named "reference" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks for a sibling or parent node with the specified name. This is useful for locating a specific section within a larger data structure where the "reference" node is expected to be found.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "reference" node. It is used to access the entire set of direct descendants of the "reference" node, which might contain various pieces of related data.
 * 
 * 3. `url`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "url" among the children of the "reference" node. This is useful for extracting specific information, such as a URL, from a structured data set where multiple types of data might be stored under the "reference" node.
