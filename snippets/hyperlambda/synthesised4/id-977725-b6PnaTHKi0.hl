// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to send an HTTP POST request to "https://api.example.com/user/profile" with a payload. The [http.post] slot is used to specify the URL, and the [convert] argument is set to true, indicating that the response should be automatically converted to a suitable format. The [payload] node is included, which is where the data to be sent in the request body would be specified, although the actual payload content is not provided in this example.
