// This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database named "chinook" and deletes records from the "PlaylistTrack" table based on conditions dynamically added from the [.arguments] node. It uses [data.connect] to establish the connection, [add] to append conditions to the [where] clause, and [data.delete] to perform the deletion. The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions, and the [return] slot provides the number of affected records.
