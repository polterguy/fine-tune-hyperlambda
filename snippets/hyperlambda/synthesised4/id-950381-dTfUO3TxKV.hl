// This Hyperlambda code concatenates the values of the nodes [year], [month], and [day], separated by hyphens, into a single string. The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine these values, resulting in a formatted date string. The [get-value] slot retrieves the values of each node, which are then concatenated with hyphens as separators.
