// This Hyperlambda code performs an HTTP GET request using a URL constructed by concatenating strings. It includes an Authorization header with a token retrieved from the [.token] node and automatically converts the response to a lambda object due to the [convert] node being set to true. The [http.get] slot initiates the request, while [strings.concat] assembles the URL.
