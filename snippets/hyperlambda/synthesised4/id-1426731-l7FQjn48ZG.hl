/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a node with the same value as the [url] node does not exist among the children of the [urls] node. If no such node is found, the [not-exists] slot evaluates to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [not-exists] - Evaluates to true if the specified expression yields zero results, indicating that no node with the same value as [url] exists among the children of [urls].
 * 2. [x:@.urls/*/={@.url}] - Expression used to specify the node set to check for existence, comparing the values of the children of [urls] with the value of [url].
