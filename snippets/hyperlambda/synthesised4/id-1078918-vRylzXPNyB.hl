/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by selecting the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the previously selected "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `chat` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "chat" from the previously retrieved child nodes. It is useful for accessing a specific argument named "chat" within the arguments list.
 * 
 * Potential use case:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to access a specific argument named "chat" that has been passed to it. This might be useful in a chat application where the function needs to process or respond to a chat message provided as an argument.
