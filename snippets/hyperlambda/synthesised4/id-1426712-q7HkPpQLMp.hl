// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [eval] slot to execute a lambda object referenced by an expression. The [eval] slot is used to execute the lambda object located at the path specified by the expression `@.invoke`. This allows for dynamic execution of code blocks within the Hyperlambda graph structure. The [eval] slot is crucial in Hyperlambda as it enables the execution of lambda objects, facilitating dynamic and flexible code execution. The code does not modify the outer graph object, as it only executes the referenced lambda object.
