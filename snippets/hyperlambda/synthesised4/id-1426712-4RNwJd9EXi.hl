// The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expression provided as its value before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this case, the expression is [x:+/*], which means it will evaluate the current node's elder sibling and all its children nodes. The result of this evaluation will be used as the value of the node where [unwrap] is invoked. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions within a lambda object before execution.
unwrap:x:+/*
