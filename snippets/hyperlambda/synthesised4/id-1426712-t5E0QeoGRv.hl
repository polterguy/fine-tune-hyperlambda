/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add a [stream] node with a boolean value of true to the [payload] node of an [http.post] request. It uses the [add] slot to insert the [stream] node at the specified location in the node hierarchy, which is within a [while] loop's [.lambda] section. The [stream] node indicates that the payload should be treated as a stream, allowing for the handling of large or continuous data transfers. The code is structured to navigate through multiple layers of nodes to accurately place the [stream] node in the desired position.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - This slot is used to insert a new node into the existing node hierarchy.
 * 2. [x:../*/.invoke/*/while/*/.lambda/*/http.post/*/payload] - This expression specifies the location in the node hierarchy where the new [stream] node will be added. It navigates through various nodes to reach the [payload] node of an [http.post] request within a [while] loop's [.lambda] section.
 * 3. [.] - This node is used to specify that the following nodes are children of the [add] slot.
 * 4. [stream:bool:true] - This node is added to the [payload] node, indicating that the payload should be treated as a stream, with a boolean value of true.
