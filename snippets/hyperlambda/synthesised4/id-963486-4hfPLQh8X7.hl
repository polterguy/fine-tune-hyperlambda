// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.create] slot to insert a new record into the "users" table. It specifies the table name as "users" and uses the [values] node to define the fields and their corresponding values. The [username] field's value is retrieved from the [.arguments] node using a lambda expression, while the [password] field's value is directly referenced from the [.password] node. This approach ensures that dynamic values are safely inserted into the database, mitigating SQL injection risks.
