// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a SQL read operation using a left join between the "activities" and "clients" tables in an SQLite database. It specifies the database type as SQLite and uses a left join to connect the "activities" table to the "clients" table based on the "client_id" field. The code also selects distinct columns, renaming the result using an alias, and includes a placeholder for additional conditions in the where clause.
