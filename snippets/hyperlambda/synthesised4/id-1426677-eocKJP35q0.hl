/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.replace-not-of] slot to replace every character in the value of the [.type] node that is not found in the specified set of characters ("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_0987654321") with an underscore ("_"). This is useful for sanitizing a string to only include specific characters, replacing all others with a placeholder. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.replace-not-of] - Replaces characters not found in the specified set with a given character.
 * 2. [.:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_0987654321] - The set of allowed characters.
 * 3. [.:_] - The replacement character for disallowed characters.
