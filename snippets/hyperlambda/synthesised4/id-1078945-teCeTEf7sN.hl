/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful for locating a specific node when you know its name but not its exact location in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "signal" node. It allows you to access all direct descendants of the "signal" node, regardless of their names. This is useful when you want to perform operations on or examine all children of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `db_time` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "db_time" from the children of the "signal" node. It is used to narrow down the node set to those that match a specific name, which is useful when you are interested in a particular type of data or node within a larger set.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * - Retrieving the database time information from a specific signal node within a larger data structure, which could be part of a logging or monitoring system.
 * - Extracting time-related data from a signal node for further processing or analysis, such as calculating time differences or generating reports.
