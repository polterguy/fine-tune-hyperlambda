// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to delete records from a SQLite database table named "patients" where the "diagnosis" column is equal to "Cold". The [sqlite.delete] slot specifies the table, and the [where] clause with [and] and [diagnosis.eq] ensures that only records with the specified condition are targeted for deletion.
sqlite.delete
   table:patients
   where
      and
         diagnosis.eq:Cold
