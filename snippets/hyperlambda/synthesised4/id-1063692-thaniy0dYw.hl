// 1. `@.public-key`: This iterator searches for the first node named "public-key" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it will not traverse children nodes, but rather look for the specified node name in the current node's hierarchy. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate data from a specific node that is not a direct child but is still within the accessible hierarchy, such as a configuration or key value that is shared across multiple parts of the Hyperlambda structure.
