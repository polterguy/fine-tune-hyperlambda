// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to format a number with leading zeros using the [format] slot. It takes an integer value of 57 and formats it to ensure it has at least 5 digits by prefixing it with zeros. The pattern used is "{0:00000}", which specifies the desired format. The [format] slot is used to apply this pattern to the integer value, resulting in a string representation of the number with leading zeros.
format:true
