/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the number of tokens required to process the content of the [.content] node using OpenAI's tokenization is less than 15,000. If the condition is true, it implies that the content is within the token limit for processing. 
 * 
 * 1. [lt] - Performs a comparison to check if the first argument is less than the second.
 * 2. [openai.tokenize] - Calculates the number of tokens the content requires.
 * 3. [.:int:15000] - Represents the integer value 15,000 as the threshold for comparison.
