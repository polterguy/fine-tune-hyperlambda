/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the "as" node, which is the second child under "columns" in a "data.read" operation, to the value obtained from the "aggregate_function" argument. It effectively renames a column in a database query to match the specified aggregate function. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of a node specified by its expression.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the "aggregate_function" argument.
