// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of a [case] slot to implement a switch-case-like structure. It evaluates the value of a node and executes the corresponding [case] block based on the matched value. The [default] slot is used to handle any unmatched cases, ensuring that a specific action is taken for all possible values. This approach allows for organized and efficient conditional branching in Hyperlambda.
