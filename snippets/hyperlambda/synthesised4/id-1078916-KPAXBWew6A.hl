/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [arguments] from the current node's context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [arguments] node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `color` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [color]. It is used to specifically retrieve the value of the [color] argument.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function or HTTP endpoint to access and manipulate the value of a [color] argument passed to it.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to apply logic based on the color specified by the user, such as changing the UI theme or validating color input.
