// The code snippet demonstrates a [case] statement that, when the integer value is 404, triggers a [throw] slot to raise an exception with the message "404 Not Found – The feedback endpoint does not exist". This is typically used to handle specific error conditions in a switch-case construct, where encountering a 404 case results in an exception being thrown, indicating the absence of the requested feedback endpoint.
case:int:404
