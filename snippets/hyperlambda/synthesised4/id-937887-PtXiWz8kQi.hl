// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses a [case] statement to evaluate a boolean condition. If the condition evaluates to true, it executes the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.result] node to the string "Car part is available". The [case] slot is typically used within a [switch] statement to handle specific conditions.
case:bool:true
   set-value:x:@.result
      .:Car part is available
