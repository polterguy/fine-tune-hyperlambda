// The code connects to a "research_lab" database and reads up to 25 records from the "experiments" table. It then adds these records to a node named "experiment-log" using the [add] slot, effectively storing the retrieved data for further processing or logging. The [get-nodes] slot is used to reference all nodes returned by the [data.read] operation.
