// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses [set-value] to change the value of the current node to the content of a file. It retrieves the file content using [io.file.load], which loads the specified file, and the file path is dynamically obtained from the [.filename] node. The [set-value] slot then assigns this content to the current node, effectively replacing its existing value.
set-value:x:-
   io.file.load:x:@.filename
