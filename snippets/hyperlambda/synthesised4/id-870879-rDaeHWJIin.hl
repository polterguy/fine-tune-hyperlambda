// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to append nodes dynamically to an existing node structure. It targets nodes within a [data.connect] expression, specifically under the [yield] and [rag_functions] nodes, and appends a new node with a value derived from the [prompt] node of the currently iterated node, using a reference through [.dp]. This approach is useful for dynamically constructing or modifying node graphs based on existing data structures.
