// The code snippet uses the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the [aggregate_column] argument is one of the specified legal values. It checks if the value is one of the columns from the "activities" table or the "client_id" table, such as "activities.activity_id" or "client_id.name". If the value is not among these, an exception is thrown.
