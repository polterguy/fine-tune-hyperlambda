// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to query a database table named "ml_blocked_ips". It includes a [where] clause with an [and] condition that checks if the "ip_address" field equals the value retrieved from the HTTP request headers using [request.headers.get]. This setup is typically used to verify if an IP address from incoming requests is listed in a blocked IPs table.
data.read
   table:ml_blocked_ips
   where
      and
         ip_address.eq:x:@request.headers.get
