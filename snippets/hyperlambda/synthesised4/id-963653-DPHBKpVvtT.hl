// The Hyperlambda code iterates over each staff member under the [company] node and sends an email to each one. It uses [for-each] to loop through staff nodes, [unwrap] to evaluate expressions, and [mail.smtp.send] to construct and send an email with a specified subject and content. The email is sent from "John" with a predefined email address.
