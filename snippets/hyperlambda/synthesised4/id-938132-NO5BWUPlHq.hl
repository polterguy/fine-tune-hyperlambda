// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to assign the value of the [.source] node to the [.target] node. The [set-value] slot changes the value of the node referenced by its expression to the result of its child slot, which in this case is [get-value] retrieving the value from [.source]. This operation effectively copies the value from [.source] to [.target].
set-value:x:@.target
   get-value:x:@.source
