/*
 * 1. `@.list` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "list" starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy. It returns the first matching node it encounters. This is useful for accessing a specific node by name when you know it exists somewhere in the hierarchy above the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node returned by the previous iterator. In this context, it will return all child nodes of the "list" node. This is useful for processing or iterating over all items within a specific parent node.
