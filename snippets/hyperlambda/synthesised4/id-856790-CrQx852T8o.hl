// The code uses the [remove-nodes] slot to delete nodes within a specific path in the node hierarchy. It targets nodes under the [signal] node, specifically those with a child node named [db] having the value "information_schema". The [remove-nodes] slot ensures that all nodes matching this criteria are removed from the structure.
