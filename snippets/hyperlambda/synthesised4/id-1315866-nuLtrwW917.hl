// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to manipulate node structures by unwrapping and adding nodes. The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate and execute expressions within nodes. In this case, it targets the third-level children of the current node's elder sibling, specifically looking for nodes named [content]. This is useful for dynamically evaluating and processing nested content nodes. Following this, the [add] slot is used to append a new node structure to the [.session] node. This structure includes a [role] node with a static value of "system" and a [content] node whose value is dynamically retrieved from the [system_message] node within the [.arguments] node. This approach is beneficial for session management where dynamic content needs to be appended based on runtime arguments.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*/content
add:x:@.session

      .
         role:system
         content:x:@.arguments/*/system_message
