/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code checks multiple conditions using the [and] slot to ensure all conditions are true. It verifies that a specific node exists, is not null, and is not equal to a given value. The [exists] slot checks if the node is present, [not-null] ensures the node has a non-null value, and [neq] confirms the node's value is not equal to a specified value. The expression uses lambda expressions to point to a specific node in the graph.
 * // 1. [exists] - Checks if the node specified by the expression exists.
 * // 2. [not-null] - Ensures the node specified by the expression is not null.
 * // 3. [neq] - Confirms the node's value is not equal to a specified value.
