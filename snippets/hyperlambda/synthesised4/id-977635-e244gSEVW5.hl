// The provided Hyperlambda code iterates over all descendant nodes of [.data] using [for-each], retrieves each node's name with [get-name], and then sets the node's name to its original value using [set-name]. Finally, it updates the node's value to its original name using [set-value]. The slots used are: [for-each] to iterate nodes, [get-name] to get node names, [set-name] to change node names, and [set-value] to update node values.
