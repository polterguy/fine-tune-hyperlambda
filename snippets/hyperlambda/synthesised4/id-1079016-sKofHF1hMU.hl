/*
 * 1. `@execute` - This iterator searches for the first node named "execute" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by its name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its siblings and ancestors.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "execute" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing further filtering or processing of these children.
 * 
 * 3. `json` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "json" among the children of the "execute" node. It is used to narrow down the selection to specific nodes of interest, in this case, those named "json".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to extract JSON-related data or configurations from a node structure where "execute" nodes contain JSON data as children.
 * - It might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or manipulate JSON data within a larger Hyperlambda script, ensuring you only target the relevant nodes.
