/*
 * The [remove-nodes] slot is used to delete specific nodes from a Hyperlambda graph. In the provided example, it removes the node named "foo2" from the children of the [.data] node. This operation is useful for dynamically modifying the structure of a Hyperlambda graph by eliminating unwanted nodes. 
 * 
 * 1. [.data] - Declares a parent node with three child nodes.
 * 2. [remove-nodes] - Removes the node "foo2" from the children of the [.data] node.
