// This Hyperlambda code defines a SQL query using the [data.read] slot to retrieve data from a SQLite database. It performs left joins between the "Products" table and the "Categories" and "Suppliers" tables, joining on specified ID columns. The query selects columns with an alias "result" and applies an unspecified aggregate function. A [where] clause is included, but no conditions are specified, and the results are limited to one record. The [limit] slot is set to 1, ensuring only a single result is returned.
