/*
 * The Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to construct a SQL query using Hyperlambda's slots to read data from a SQLite database. It specifies a left join between the "opportunities" and "clients" tables, using "client_id" as an alias. The query selects distinct records with an alias "count" and applies a "where" clause with an "and" condition for filtering. The code effectively illustrates how to use Hyperlambda for SQL query construction with joins, column aliasing, and conditional filtering.
 * 
 * 1. [data.read] - Initiates a data read operation from a specified database.
 * 2. [database-type] - Specifies the type of database being used, in this case, SQLite.
 * 3. [table] - Indicates the primary table from which data is being read.
 * 4. [join] - Specifies a join operation with another table.
 * 5. [as] - Provides an alias for the joined table.
 * 6. [type] - Defines the type of join, here a left join.
 * 7. [on] - Specifies the condition for the join operation.
 * 8. [and] - Combines multiple conditions for the join.
 * 9. [columns] - Lists the columns to be selected in the query.
 * 10. [distinct_functor] - Represents a distinct selection operation.
 * 11. [as] - Aliases the result of the distinct operation as "count".
 * 12. [where] - Introduces a filtering condition for the query.
 * 13. [and] - Placeholder for additional conditions in the "where" clause.
