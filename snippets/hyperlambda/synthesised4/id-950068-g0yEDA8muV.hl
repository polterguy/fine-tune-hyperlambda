// Iterates over each node resulting from the expression [@signal/*], and for each node, it replaces occurrences of a string within its value using [strings.replace]. The string to look for is obtained from [@.arguments/*/folder], and the replacement string is empty, effectively removing the specified substring from each node's value. The modified value is then set back to the node using [set-value].
