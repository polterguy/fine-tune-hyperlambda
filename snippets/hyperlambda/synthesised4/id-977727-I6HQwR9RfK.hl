// The [throw] slot is used to raise an exception with a specific message, "Something went wrong when invoking HTTP POST" in this case. This can be useful for error handling in your Hyperlambda code, allowing you to signal an error condition that can be caught and managed by a [.catch] block or propagate to the client if not handled.
