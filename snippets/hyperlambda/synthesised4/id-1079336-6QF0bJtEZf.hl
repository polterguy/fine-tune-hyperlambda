/*
 * 1. `@.words` - This iterator searches for the first node named "words" within the current context. It starts from the current node and looks for a sibling or ancestor node with this name. This is useful for locating a specific node in a hierarchical structure where "words" is a key node containing relevant data or further nodes.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "words" node. It is used to access each direct child node of the "words" node, allowing operations or evaluations on each child node. This is particularly useful for iterating over a list of items or elements contained within the "words" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a text processing application where "words" is a node containing individual word nodes, and you want to perform operations on each word.
 * - It could be part of a data transformation task where you need to access and manipulate each child node under a "words" node, such as converting text to uppercase or filtering specific words.
