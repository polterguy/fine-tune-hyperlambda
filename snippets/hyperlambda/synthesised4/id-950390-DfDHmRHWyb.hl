// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [return] slot to return a single node with a boolean value of true. The [return] slot is typically used within dynamically created slots or other contexts that support returning values, allowing the encapsulated logic to produce a result that can be used by the caller. Here, the [result] node is returned with its value explicitly set to true, indicating a successful or positive outcome.
