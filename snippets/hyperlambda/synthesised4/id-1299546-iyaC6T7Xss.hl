// This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to read data from a "contacts" table in a database and yield the results. The [data.read] slot is used to specify the table from which data is to be retrieved, in this case, the "contacts" table. The [where] clause is included, but it is empty, meaning no specific conditions are applied to filter the data, so all records from the "contacts" table will be retrieved. The [yield] slot is then used to return the results of the [data.read] operation. It uses an expression to reference all child nodes of the [data.read] slot, effectively yielding all the records retrieved from the "contacts" table. This setup is useful for retrieving and returning all entries from a database table without any filtering conditions.
