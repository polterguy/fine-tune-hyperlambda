// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a switch-case structure to handle a specific case labeled "double". When this case is matched, it sets the value of a node referenced by [.dp] by converting its current value to a type specified dynamically from the [.action] node's arguments. The [set-value] slot is used to update the node's value, and the [convert] slot is employed to change the type of the node's value based on a dynamically retrieved type from the [.action] node's arguments.
