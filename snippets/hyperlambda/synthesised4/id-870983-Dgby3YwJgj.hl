// This Hyperlambda code performs an HTTP GET request to the OpenAI API endpoint for models. It includes an authorization header with a token and converts the response into a lambda object. The [http.get] slot specifies the URL, [headers] adds the Authorization token, and [convert] ensures the response is automatically transformed into a lambda object.
