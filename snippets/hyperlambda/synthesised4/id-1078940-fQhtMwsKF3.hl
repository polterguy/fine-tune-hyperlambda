/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate upwards in the hierarchy to access the parent node.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all direct children of the parent node retrieved by the previous iterator.
 * 3. `add` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "add". It is used to locate specific nodes named "add" among the children.
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "add" nodes. It is used to access all direct children of the "add" nodes.
 * 5. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access all direct children of the nodes retrieved by the previous iterator.
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access all direct children of the nodes retrieved by the previous iterator.
 * 7. `prompt` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "prompt". It is used to locate specific nodes named "prompt" among the children.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to find and manipulate or evaluate nodes named "prompt" that are deeply nested within a hierarchy, specifically under nodes named "add". This might be useful in scenarios where you need to extract or modify prompts associated with addition operations in a complex data structure.
