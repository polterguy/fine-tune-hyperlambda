/*
 * 1. `@html2markdown`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "html2markdown" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to locate a node responsible for converting HTML content to Markdown format. This might be useful in a context where you need to transform HTML documents into a more lightweight and readable Markdown format for further processing or storage.
 * - It could also be used in a content management system where content is stored in HTML format but needs to be displayed or exported in Markdown.
