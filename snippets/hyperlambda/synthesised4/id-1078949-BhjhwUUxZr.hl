/*
 * 1. `@json2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node in the current context with the name "json2lambda". It is often used to locate a specific node within a larger structure, especially when you know the exact name of the node you are looking for.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "json2lambda" node. It is useful when you want to perform operations or checks on every child node under a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `_type` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "_type" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is typically used to focus on nodes that have a specific role or characteristic, such as identifying the type of data or operation associated with each node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to extract or process the type information of nodes that are children of a "json2lambda" node, possibly to convert JSON data into a different format or to validate the types of data being processed.
