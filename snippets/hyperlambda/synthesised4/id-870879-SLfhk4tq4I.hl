// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to add the result of a [strings.trim] operation to a node set. The [add] slot is used to append nodes to a specified node set, and in this case, it targets the nodes located at the path specified by the expression in its value. The [strings.trim] slot trims a string by removing specified characters from both ends, and its result is added to the node set. The code effectively combines string manipulation with node addition in a Hyperlambda graph.
