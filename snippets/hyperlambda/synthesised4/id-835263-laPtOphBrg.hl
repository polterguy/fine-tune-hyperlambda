// The Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [strings.split] slot to divide a string into multiple parts based on a specified delimiter. It first trims the string using [strings.trim] to remove unwanted characters, then splits the string at each occurrence of the ":" character, resulting in a node set where each node represents a split segment of the original string. This process is useful for parsing and processing delimited strings.
