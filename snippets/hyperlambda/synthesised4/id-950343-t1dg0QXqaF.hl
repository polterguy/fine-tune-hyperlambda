// This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if a case matches the integer value 200, and if so, it sets the value of the node [activity.result] to the value retrieved from the [activity] node within the [content] node of an HTTP GET response. The [set-value] slot is used to assign the value, and [get-value] is used to extract the desired value from the response.
case:int:200
   set-value:x:@.activity.result
      get-value:x:@http.get/*/content/*/activity
