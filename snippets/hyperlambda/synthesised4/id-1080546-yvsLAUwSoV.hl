/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by selecting the first node named "arguments" in the current context. This is typically used to access the root node of the arguments passed into a function or a slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. This is useful for iterating over or accessing all the parameters or arguments provided to a function.
 * 
 * 3. `group_column` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "group_column". This is typically used to access a specific argument or parameter named "group_column" from the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is useful in a scenario where you need to access a specific argument named "group_column" from a set of arguments passed to a function or slot. For example, if you have a function that processes data based on a column name provided as an argument, this expression would allow you to retrieve that specific column name from the arguments.
