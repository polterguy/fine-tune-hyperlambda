// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [json2lambda] slot to convert a JSON string into a lambda object. The JSON string is first processed by the [strings.trim] slot, which removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the string. This ensures that the JSON input is clean and properly formatted before being transformed into a lambda object. The resulting lambda object can then be used for further processing or manipulation within the Hyperlambda environment.
json2lambda:x:@strings.trim
