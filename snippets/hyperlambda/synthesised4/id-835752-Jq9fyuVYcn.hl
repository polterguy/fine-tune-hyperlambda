// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of nodes within a specific path in a data connection structure. It targets nodes under [data.connect], specifically within [data.read] and [group], and renames them based on the value of a [group_column] argument. The [set-name] slot is used to perform this renaming operation, and [get-value] retrieves the new name from the [group_column] argument.
set-name:x:@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column
