/*
 * 1. `@strings.concat`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "strings.concat" from the current context. It is used to locate the node responsible for concatenating strings. A potential use case is when you have a node structure where multiple "strings.concat" nodes exist, and you need to specifically target the first one for further operations.
 * 
 * 2. `@strings.concat`: This is a repetition of the previous iterator, applied to the result of the first "strings.concat" node. It retrieves the first "strings.concat" node within the children of the initially found "strings.concat" node. This could be useful in scenarios where you have nested string concatenation operations and you want to access the first nested "strings.concat" node for additional processing or evaluation.
