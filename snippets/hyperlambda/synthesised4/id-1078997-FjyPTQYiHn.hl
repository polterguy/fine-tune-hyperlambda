/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator searches for the first node named [.dp] within the current context. It is used to locate a specific node that might be holding a reference or value that is needed for further processing.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the [.dp] node. It assumes that the value of the [.dp] node is a reference to another node, and it retrieves that node by reference. This is useful when you need to work with the actual node that [.dp] points to, rather than just its value.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous step. It is used to access the entire set of children nodes for further filtering or processing.
 * 
 * 4. `Field` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "Field" from the children nodes obtained in the previous step. It is used to narrow down the search to specific nodes of interest, in this case, nodes named "Field".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to extract or manipulate data specifically stored in nodes named "Field" that are children of a node referenced by [.dp]. For example, it could be used in a data processing task where fields need to be updated or validated based on certain conditions.
