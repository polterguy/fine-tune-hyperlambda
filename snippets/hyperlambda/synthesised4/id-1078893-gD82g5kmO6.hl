// 1. `@.has-scheduler`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "has-scheduler" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, checking each node's name. If it finds a node named "has-scheduler", it returns that node. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to check if a certain feature or property, like "has-scheduler", is enabled or configured in the current context or any of its parent contexts.
