/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It's typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which often contains parameters or input data for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `.arguments` node. It's useful for accessing all parameters or input data provided within the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `prompt` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `prompt`. It's used to specifically target nodes that are intended to contain a prompt, which might be used for generating responses or further processing.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * 
 * - Accessing a specific prompt provided as an argument to a Hyperlambda function or endpoint, which could then be used to generate a response or perform some operation based on the prompt's content.
 * - Filtering input data to focus on a particular parameter named `prompt`, which might be used in applications involving natural language processing or AI-driven interactions.
