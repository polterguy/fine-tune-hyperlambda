/*
 * 1. `.`: This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you want to navigate upwards in the hierarchy to access or manipulate parent nodes.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current result set. It is commonly used to iterate over or access all immediate child nodes of a given node.
 * 
 * 3. `yield`: This iterator filters the current result set to only include nodes with the name "yield". It is useful when you are specifically interested in nodes that are responsible for returning values in a dynamic slot or a file execution.
 * 
 * 4. `*`: Similar to the previous `*`, this retrieves all children nodes of the current result set, which in this context would be the children of the "yield" node.
 * 
 * 5. `result`: This iterator filters the current result set to only include nodes with the name "result". It is typically used to access the final output or result of a computation or operation, especially in dynamic slots or executed files.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression could be used in a dynamic slot or a file execution context to retrieve the final result of a computation or operation that is encapsulated within a "yield" node. It allows the developer to access the output value that is meant to be returned or further processed.
 * - It could be used in a logging or debugging scenario to verify the output of a dynamic slot or file execution by extracting the result value for inspection or logging purposes.
