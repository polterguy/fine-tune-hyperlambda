/*
 * The Hyperlambda code uses the [insert-after] slot to insert a node with a name of "description" after the "name" node within the ".arg" node. The value of the "description" node is retrieved from the "description" node within the ".dp" node, which is passed by reference. 
 * 
 * 1. [insert-after] - Inserts nodes after the specified node(s) in the expression.
 * 2. [x:@.arg/*/name] - Expression pointing to the "name" node within the ".arg" node.
 * 3. [.] - Denotes a collection of nodes to be inserted.
 * 4. [description:x:@.dp/#/*/description] - Inserts a "description" node with its value retrieved from the "description" node within the ".dp" node.
