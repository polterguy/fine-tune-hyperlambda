/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [max_request_tokens] node inside the [.model] node to the result of a division operation. The division result is retrieved using the [get-value] slot, which points to a previously executed [math.divide] operation. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the specified node.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the result of a [math.divide] operation.
