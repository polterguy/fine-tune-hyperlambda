/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specific substring within a given string. It targets the [header] node value, replacing backslashes with an empty string, and assigns the modified result to the [result] node. The [get-first-value] slot retrieves the first value from the [strings.replace] operation. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a substring within a string.
 * 2. [get-first-value] - Retrieves the first value from the result of the [strings.replace] operation.
 * 3. [strings.replace] (nested) - Replaces backslashes in the [header] node value with an empty string.
 * 4. [.] - Represents the static value used in the replacement process.
