// The code snippet demonstrates how to define a Hyperlambda node with the name "case" and the type "longblob". This is used to specify a binary large object (BLOB) data type, typically for storing large amounts of binary data such as images or files in a database. The "longblob" type is often used in SQL databases to handle large binary objects efficiently.
case:longblob
