/*
 * This code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. It sets the value of the [@.result] node by replacing occurrences of the string "[[rtl]]" with "false" in its current value, but only if all preceding conditional slots (like [if] or [else-if]) have evaluated to false. 
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes its child nodes if all preceding conditional slots have evaluated to false.
 * 2. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [@.result] node.
 * 3. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of the string "[[rtl]]" with "false" in the value of the [@.result] node.
