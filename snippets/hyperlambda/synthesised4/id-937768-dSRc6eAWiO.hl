// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [fork] slot to execute a [math.add] operation in parallel. The [math.add] slot adds two integer values, 20 and 30, resulting in 50. The [fork] slot allows this addition to occur asynchronously, enabling concurrent execution with other tasks.
fork
   math.add
      .:int:20
      .:int:30
