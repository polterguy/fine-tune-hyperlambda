// The code demonstrates how to use the [insert-before] slot to insert a node before a specified node in a Hyperlambda structure. It targets the node [task1] under the [tasks] parent node and inserts a new node [task0] with the value "Preliminary task" before it. The [insert-before] slot is used to modify the node structure by adding new nodes at a specific position relative to existing nodes.
