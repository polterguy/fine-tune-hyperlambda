// The [type] slot returns the Hyperlambda type name of a specified value. In the given example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer type and a value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to retrieve the type of the node, which will result in "int". This demonstrates how to extract type information from a node in Hyperlambda.
