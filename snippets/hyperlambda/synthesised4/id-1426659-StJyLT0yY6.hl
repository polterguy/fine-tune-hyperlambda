/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert a new node into a specific location within a node structure. The code targets the first child node of the [.snippets] node and inserts a new node after the specified position. The [add] slot is used to dynamically modify the structure by adding nodes at runtime.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - This slot is used to add a new node to a specified location within the node structure.
 * 2. [x:@.snippets/0/-] - This expression specifies the target location for the new node, pointing to the first child node of [.snippets].
 * 3. [.] - Represents the new node to be added.
 * 4. [completion] - The name of the new node being added.
 * 5. [@"] - The value of the [completion] node, which is an empty string in this case.
