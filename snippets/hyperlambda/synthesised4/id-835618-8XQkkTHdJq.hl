/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specific location in a Hyperlambda graph. It adds nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] from [.arguments] to the path specified by the [add] slot, effectively merging the nodes from [.arguments] into the target location. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified location in the Hyperlambda graph.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] path to be added.
