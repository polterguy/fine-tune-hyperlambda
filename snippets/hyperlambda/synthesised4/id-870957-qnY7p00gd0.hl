// The code snippet uses the [not] slot to negate the result of an [eq] slot that checks if the first element obtained from splitting a string is equal to "zip". The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the first node from the result of a [strings.split] operation, and [eq] compares it to "zip". If they are not equal, [not] returns true.
