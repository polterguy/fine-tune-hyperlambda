// This Hyperlambda code uses [set-value] to change the value of the [.cur] node. It concatenates the static string "http:" with the value retrieved from the node pointed to by the expression [get-value:x:"@.dp/#/*/\\@href"], and assigns the result to [.cur]. The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine the static string and the retrieved value into a single string.
