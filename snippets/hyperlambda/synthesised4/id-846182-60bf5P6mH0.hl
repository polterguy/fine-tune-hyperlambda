// The [else] slot is used to execute a block of code when none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are met. In this example, the [else] block sets the value of the [.type] node to "string" using the [set-value] slot. This ensures that if no prior conditions are true, the [.type] node is assigned the value "string".
