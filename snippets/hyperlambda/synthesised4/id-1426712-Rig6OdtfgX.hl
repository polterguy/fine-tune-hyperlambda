// The Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate expressions before they are reached by the Hyperlambda instruction pointer. The expression "x:+/*/*" is unwrapped, meaning that any nodes or values pointed to by this expression will be evaluated and their values will be set in place of the [unwrap] slot before the execution continues. This is useful for preparing or transforming data before it is used in subsequent operations.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
