/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a signal to a specific session. It includes an [args] node with a child node named [function_waiting] set to a boolean value of false. This setup is typically used to notify a particular session about a change in state or condition, such as indicating that a specific function is no longer waiting or active. The [args] node's children are automatically transformed into a JSON object and sent as part of the signal. 
 * 
 * 1. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to a specified session.
 * 2. [args] - Contains the arguments to be sent with the signal, converted to JSON.
 * 3. [function_waiting] - A boolean argument set to false, indicating a specific state or condition.
