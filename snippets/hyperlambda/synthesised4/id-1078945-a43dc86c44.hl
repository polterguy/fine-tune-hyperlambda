/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the hierarchy from where the expression is being evaluated.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node that was selected by the previous iterator. In this case, it will retrieve all children of the parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `remove-nodes` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "remove-nodes". It will select nodes named "remove-nodes" among the children of the parent node.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - This expression can be used to find and potentially manipulate or remove nodes named "remove-nodes" that are direct children of the parent node of the current context. It can be useful in scenarios where you need to clean up or process specific nodes in a tree structure based on their name.
