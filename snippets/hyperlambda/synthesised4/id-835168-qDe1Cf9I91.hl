// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [yield] slot to return values from a dynamically created slot or an executed file. It retrieves the [ticket] value from the result of an [execute] operation and the [extra] nodes from the current context, returning them as part of the output. This allows for structured data to be returned from a Hyperlambda execution.
yield
   ticket:x:@execute/*/ticket
   extra:x:@.extra/*
