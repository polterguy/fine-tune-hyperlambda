/*
 * 1. `@.no-invocation`: This iterator searches for the first node named "no-invocation" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It will not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific ancestor node by name, ensuring that you are referencing a node that is part of the current execution context. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve configuration or context information stored in a specific ancestor node named "no-invocation", which might be necessary for making decisions or performing operations based on the broader context of the current execution.
