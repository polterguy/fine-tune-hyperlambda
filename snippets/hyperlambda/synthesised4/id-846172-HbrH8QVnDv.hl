// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.dp/#/*/notnull]. It uses the [get-value] slot to access the value of a node that is a child of the [notnull] node, which is itself a child of the node referenced by [@.dp]. The [#] iterator is used to dereference the value of the [.dp] node, allowing for direct access to its children.
