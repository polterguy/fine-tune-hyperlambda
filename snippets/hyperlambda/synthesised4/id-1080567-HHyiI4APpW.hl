/*
 * 1. `@data.select` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node in the current context that has the name "data.select". The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name. This is useful when you need to locate a specific node in a complex data structure to perform operations on it.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "data.select" node. The `*` symbol is used to access all direct children nodes, which can be useful for iterating over or processing multiple items contained within a parent node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include scenarios where you need to process or analyze data items stored under a "data.select" node, such as filtering, transforming, or aggregating data elements in a data processing pipeline.
