// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions: it checks if a node named "indexed" exists within the [.arguments] node using [exists], and retrieves its value using [get-value]. The [and] slot will only return true if both conditions are met, meaning the "indexed" node must exist and have a non-null value.
