/*
 * This Hyperlambda code iterates over each child node of the [.names] node using [for-each], and appends each node's value to the [.full-content] node. It uses [strings.concat] to concatenate the current value of [.full-content] with the value of the currently iterated node, separated by a newline character. The [set-value] slot updates [.full-content] with the concatenated result. 
 * 
 * 1. [for-each] - Iterates over each child node of [.names].
 * 2. [set-value] - Updates the [.full-content] node with a new value.
 * 3. [strings.concat] - Concatenates the current [.full-content] value with the iterated node's value and a newline.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the current value of [.full-content] and the iterated node's value.
 * 5. [.] - Represents a static value, in this case, a newline character.
