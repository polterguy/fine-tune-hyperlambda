/*
 * 1. `@.cache-session` - This iterator searches for the first node named "cache-session" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It stops as soon as it finds a node with this name. This is useful for accessing a specific node that might be a sibling or ancestor, allowing you to retrieve or manipulate session-related data stored in a node named "cache-session".
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "cache-session" node. It's useful for accessing all data stored within the "cache-session" node, which might include session variables or other related information.
 * 
 * **Use Case**: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access all session data stored within a "cache-session" node, perhaps to validate or manipulate session variables for a web application.
