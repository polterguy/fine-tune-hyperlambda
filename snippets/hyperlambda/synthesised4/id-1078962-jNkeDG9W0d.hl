/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate upwards in the hierarchy from the current node.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access all immediate descendants.
 * 3. `return` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those with the name "return". It is used to narrow down the node set to specific nodes of interest.
 * 4. `*` - Once again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes filtered by the previous iterator. It is used to access the descendants of the "return" nodes.
 * 5. `snippets` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those with the name "snippets". It is used to further narrow down the node set to specific nodes of interest.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to extract specific code snippets or data segments from a larger structure, where these snippets are nested under "return" nodes. This might be useful in a code analysis tool or a documentation generator that needs to extract and process specific parts of a codebase.
