// The code snippet demonstrates how to execute a dynamic Hyperlambda slot named "magic.auth.change-password". It takes two arguments: [password], which is the new password to be set, and [is_hashed], indicating whether the provided password is already hashed. The slot is typically used in a context where a password change operation is required, such as updating a user's password in an authentication system.
execute:magic.auth.change-password
   password:x:@.arguments/*/password
   is_hashed:x:@.arguments/*/is_hashed
