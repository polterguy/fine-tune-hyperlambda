// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is used with an expression pointing to the next sibling node using the "+" iterator and the "/**" expression to include all descendants. This means that the expressions in the sibling node and its descendants will be evaluated before the current node is processed. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions in a node graph, ensuring that any dynamic values are resolved before further processing.
