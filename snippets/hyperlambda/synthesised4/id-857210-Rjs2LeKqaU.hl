// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, `documents` and `clients`, using the `join` slot. The join is based on matching the `client_id` column from both tables, with the `clients` table being aliased as `client_id`. This allows for retrieving all records from the `documents` table and the matching records from the `clients` table, or `NULL` if there is no match. The `type:left` specifies the type of join, ensuring all records from the left table (`documents`) are included.
