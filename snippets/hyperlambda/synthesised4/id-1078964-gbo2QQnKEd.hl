/*
 * 1. `@.ignored`: This iterator searches for the first node named "ignored" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node's siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you need to find a specific node by name within a complex structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving configuration or metadata nodes that are consistently named "ignored" across different parts of a Hyperlambda structure.
 * - Accessing a node that serves as a flag or marker, indicating certain conditions or states within a larger Hyperlambda graph.
