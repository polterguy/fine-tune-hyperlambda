/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is before the current node in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set, which in this case is the "arguments" node. It is used to access all argument nodes provided under the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `database` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "database" from the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically access the "database" argument if it exists.
