/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 *    
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node set. In this context, it will retrieve all children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `prompt` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "prompt". It is used to specifically target nodes named "prompt" among the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract a "prompt" argument from a set of arguments passed to a Hyperlambda slot or function. It is useful in scenarios where you need to process or manipulate the "prompt" value specifically, such as in a text generation or natural language processing task.
