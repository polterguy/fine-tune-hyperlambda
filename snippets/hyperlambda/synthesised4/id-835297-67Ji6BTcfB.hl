// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] block to define specific conditions or values that, when matched, execute the associated lambda object. In this example, the [case] node has a value of "date", and if the [switch] expression evaluates to "date", the lambda object within this [case] will be executed.
case:date
