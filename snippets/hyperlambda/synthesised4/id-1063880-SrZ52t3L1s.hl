/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to access the arguments node, which is typically the root node for parameters in a Hyperlambda execution context.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any parameter nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 3. `url` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "url" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically access the "url" parameter within the arguments.
