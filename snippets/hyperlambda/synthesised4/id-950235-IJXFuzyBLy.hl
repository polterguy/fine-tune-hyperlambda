// The code demonstrates the use of the [signal] slot to invoke a previously created dynamic slot named "hello". The [signal] slot allows for the execution of dynamic slots defined elsewhere in the application, enabling modular and reusable code structures. This invocation will execute the logic defined in the "hello" slot, which must have been created prior to this invocation.
signal:hello
