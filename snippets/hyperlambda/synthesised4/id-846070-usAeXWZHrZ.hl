// The code uses the [neq] slot to check if the value of the node referenced by the expression "@.dp/#/*/\\@href/[0,1]" is not equal to the value of the node represented by ".:#". The expression navigates through a node structure to find a specific node, and the [neq] slot evaluates whether these two values are different.
