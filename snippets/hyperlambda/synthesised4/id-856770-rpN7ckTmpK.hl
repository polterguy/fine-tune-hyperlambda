// This Hyperlambda code checks whether the [api_key] node within the [data.read] structure is not null and not empty. The [and] slot ensures both conditions must be true for the overall evaluation to be true. The [not-null] slot verifies that the [api_key] node exists and has a value, while the [neq] slot confirms that the value is not an empty string.
