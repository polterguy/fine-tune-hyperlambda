// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to execute a SQL query to select the latest 10 records from the "transactions" table, ordered by the "transaction_date" in descending order. The [data.select] slot is used to execute the SQL statement, and the [database-type] argument specifies that the query should be executed using MySQL syntax.
data.select:select * from transactions order by transaction_date desc limit 10
   database-type:mysql
