/*
 * 1. `.`: This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to move one level up in the hierarchy from the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access all nodes directly under the parent node retrieved by the previous `.` iterator.
 * 
 * 3. `signal`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "signal". It is used to narrow down the result set to nodes specifically named "signal".
 * 
 * 4. `=`: This iterator compares the value of nodes in the previous result set to a specified value. In this case, it checks for nodes with the value "magic.ai.crawl-site". It is used to further filter the nodes to those with this specific value.
 * 
 * 5. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access all nodes directly under the nodes that matched the previous criteria.
 * 
 * 6. `.onafter`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name ".onafter". It is used to narrow down the result set to nodes specifically named ".onafter".
 * 
 * 7. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access all nodes directly under the ".onafter" nodes.
 * 
 * 8. `.flavor`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name ".flavor". It is used to narrow down the result set to nodes specifically named ".flavor".
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * - Extracting configuration or metadata related to a "magic.ai.crawl-site" signal, specifically focusing on the ".flavor" attribute within the ".onafter" context.
 * - Analyzing or processing specific nodes in a data structure that represent post-processing steps or configurations for a web crawling task.
