// This Hyperlambda code divides the result of subtracting the value of [max_tokens] node from 200,000 by 2. It first calculates the difference between 200,000 and the value of [max_tokens], then divides that result by 2. The [math.subtract] slot performs the subtraction, and the [math.divide] slot performs the division.
