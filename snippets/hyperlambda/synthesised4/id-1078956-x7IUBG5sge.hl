/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It is used to move to the next node in the hierarchy, which is located directly below the current node. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the next node in sequence.
 * 
 * 2. `**` - This is a breadth-first search iterator that retrieves all descendant nodes of the current node, including the node itself. It is useful for operations that need to traverse an entire subtree, such as searching for specific nodes or aggregating data from multiple levels.
 * 
 * 3. `content` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "content". It is used to narrow down the search to specific nodes of interest, which is particularly useful when looking for nodes with a specific purpose or data type.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving all "content" nodes from the elder sibling of the current node, which could be useful in scenarios where content needs to be aggregated or processed from a specific section of a document or data structure.
 * - Searching for specific data within a complex hierarchy, where the "content" nodes represent meaningful or actionable information.
