/*
 * 1. `@.arg` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "arg" in the current context. It searches upwards in the hierarchy, starting from the current node, and includes siblings and ancestors.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - Once the "arg" node is found, this iterator retrieves all of its children nodes. This is useful when you want to perform operations on or examine all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `name` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "name". It is used to narrow down the selection to specific nodes of interest.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include extracting or processing the "name" nodes within a specific "arg" node, such as when you need to gather all names from a list of arguments in a function or a configuration setting.
