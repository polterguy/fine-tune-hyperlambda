// 1. `@.instruction`: This iterator looks for the first node named "instruction" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access configuration or control data that is defined at a higher level in the node hierarchy, such as retrieving a set of instructions or parameters that apply to the current context.
