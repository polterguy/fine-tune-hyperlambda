/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node, which in this case is the "arguments" node. This is useful for accessing all argument nodes provided to a function or slot.
 * 3. `aggregate_function` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those with the name "aggregate_function". This is useful when you want to specifically access or manipulate the "aggregate_function" argument within the arguments node.
