// This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to read data from a database table named "Planets" and return the results as a node list. The [data.read] slot is used to specify the table from which to retrieve data, and it is configured to dynamically order, limit, and offset the results based on arguments passed into the lambda. Specifically, the [order], [direction], [limit], and [offset] slots are set using expressions that reference nodes within the [.arguments] node, allowing for flexible input parameters to control the SQL query execution. Finally, the [yield] slot is used to return the data retrieved by [data.read] as a node list, making it accessible for further processing or output. This setup is useful for creating a dynamic and reusable data retrieval function that can be easily customized through input arguments.
