// This Hyperlambda code uses the [set-name] slot to change the name of nodes referenced by its expression, specifically targeting nodes within a certain path. It concatenates a string using [strings.concat] to form a SQL-like expression "count(distinct {column})", where {column} is dynamically retrieved from [get-value] pointing to a [distinct_column] node. This is useful for dynamically constructing SQL queries with distinct count functions.
