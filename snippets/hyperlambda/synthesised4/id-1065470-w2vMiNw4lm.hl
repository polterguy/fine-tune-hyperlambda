// 1. `@strings.concat`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "strings.concat" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, beginning from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy if necessary. The primary use case for this iterator is to locate a specific node that performs a string concatenation operation, which might be part of a larger Hyperlambda script that involves string manipulation.
