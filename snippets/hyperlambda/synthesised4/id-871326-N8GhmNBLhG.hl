// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database table named "CustomerDemographics" using the [data.read] slot. It specifies an aggregate function as a column with an alias "result", applies a "where" condition using an "and" logical operator, and groups the results by a specified "group_column". The [database-type] is set to "sqlite", indicating the type of database being queried.
