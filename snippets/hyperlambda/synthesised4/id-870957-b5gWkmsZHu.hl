// Moves a specified folder to a new destination. The source folder is dynamically determined using an expression, and the destination path is obtained by concatenating strings. The [io.folder.move] slot is used to perform the move operation, with the source specified by [x:@.folder] and the destination path derived from [get-value:x:@strings.concat].
io.folder.move:x:@.folder
