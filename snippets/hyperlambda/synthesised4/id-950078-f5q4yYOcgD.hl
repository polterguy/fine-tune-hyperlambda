/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement to evaluate the current day of the week, specifically checking for the case of "Saturday". If the current day matches "Saturday", it executes the associated lambda block. This pattern is useful for executing specific logic based on the day of the week, allowing for customized behavior on different days.
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Evaluates the current day of the week.
 * 2. [saturday] - Checks if the current day is Saturday.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Executes the associated logic block if the case condition is met.
