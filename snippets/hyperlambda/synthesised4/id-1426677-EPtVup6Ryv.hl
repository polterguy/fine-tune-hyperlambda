/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet deletes records from the "ml_types" table where the "type" column matches the value of the [.type] node. It uses the [data.delete] slot to specify the table and the [where] clause to filter the records to be deleted based on the condition provided. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.delete] - Initiates the deletion process from a specified table.
 * 2. [table] - Specifies the table "ml_types" from which records should be deleted.
 * 3. [where] - Begins the condition for filtering records to delete.
 * 4. [and] - Logical operator used to combine multiple conditions, though here it is used with a single condition.
 * 5. [type.eq] - Compares the "type" column with a specified value.
 * 6. [x:@.type] - Expression pointing to the value of the [.type] node to be used in the comparison.
