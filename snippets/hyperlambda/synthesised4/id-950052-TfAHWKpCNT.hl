// The code checks if an HTTP GET request returns a status code between 200 and 299, indicating a successful response. If true, it extracts the first and last names from the response content and assigns them to the user's first and last name nodes. The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, and the [set-value] slot updates the user information.
