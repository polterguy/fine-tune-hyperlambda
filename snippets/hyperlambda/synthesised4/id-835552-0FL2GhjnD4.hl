// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds nodes to the current node's children by retrieving nodes specified by expressions. It uses [add] to append nodes, where [get-nodes] retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node, specifically the [order] and [direction] nodes. The expressions in [get-nodes] determine which nodes to retrieve, allowing dynamic manipulation of the node structure based on the arguments provided.
