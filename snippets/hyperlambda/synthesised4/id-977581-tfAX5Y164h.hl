// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to create a new record in the "users" table with specified values for "username" and "password". The [data.create] slot is used to insert a record into the database. The [values] node specifies the fields and their corresponding values, where the "username" is dynamically retrieved from the arguments, and the "password" is hashed using the [crypto.password.hash] slot to ensure security.
data.create
   table:users
   values
      username:x:@.arguments/*/username
      password:x:@crypto.password.hash
