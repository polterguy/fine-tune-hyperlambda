// The Hyperlambda code converts the third element of a split string into a long integer and sets it as the value of the [.seed] node. The [set-value] slot changes the value of [.seed], while [convert] changes the type of the split string element to long. [strings.split] splits the string, and the expression retrieves the third element.
