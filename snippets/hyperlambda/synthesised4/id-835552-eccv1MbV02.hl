/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds nodes retrieved from the [.arguments] node to the [where] clause of a [data.read] operation. It uses [get-nodes] to fetch all child nodes of [.arguments] and appends them to the [where] clause, allowing for dynamic query conditions based on input arguments. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified location.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves all child nodes of [.arguments] to be added to the [where] clause.
