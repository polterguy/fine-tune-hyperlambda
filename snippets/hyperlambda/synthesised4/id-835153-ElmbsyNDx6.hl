/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes to a destination node's children collection. It retrieves nodes using [get-nodes] from a reference node [.dp], and adds them to the [.models] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified destination node's children collection.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the reference node [.dp] to be added.
