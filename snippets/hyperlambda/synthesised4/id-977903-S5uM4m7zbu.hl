// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [math.subtract] slot to calculate the difference between the integer 2025 and the value retrieved from the [birthYear] node within the [.arguments] node. The [get-value] slot is used to fetch the value of [birthYear], and the result of the subtraction will be the output of the [math.subtract] operation.
