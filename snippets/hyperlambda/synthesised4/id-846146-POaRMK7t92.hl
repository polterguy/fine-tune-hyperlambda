// This Hyperlambda code calculates the remaining number of snippets by subtracting the sum of two values, [below-threshold] and [already-exists], from [total-snippets]. It uses [math.add] to sum the two values and [math.subtract] to find the difference with [total-snippets]. The slots involved are: [math.subtract], [math.add], [get-value].
math.subtract:x:@.total-snippets
   math.add
