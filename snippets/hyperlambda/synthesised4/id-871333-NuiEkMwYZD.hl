// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database table named "Customers". It specifies the use of a distinct function on a column, aliasing the result as "count". The code also sets up a "where" clause with an "and" logical operator, allowing for further conditions to be added for filtering the data.
