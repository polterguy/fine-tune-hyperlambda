/*
 * // The code uses the [return-nodes] slot to return all nodes that are referenced by the expression "@.result/*". This implies that it will return all child nodes of the [.result] node. This slot is typically used within a dynamically created slot or other slots that explicitly create a return context, allowing you to return multiple nodes as a result of the slot's execution.
 * // 
 * // 1. [return-nodes] - Initiates the return of nodes.
 * // 2. [x:@.result/*] - Expression pointing to all child nodes of the [.result] node, which will be returned.
