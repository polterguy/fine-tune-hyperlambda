// This Hyperlambda code snippet checks two conditions using the [and] slot. It first verifies the existence of a node at the specified path using [exists], and then checks if the token count of a specified text, calculated by [openai.tokenize], is less than 5000 using [lt]. If both conditions are true, the [and] slot will evaluate to true.
