// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a logical condition using the [and] slot to ensure that the [Orders.ShipVia] node is equal to the [ShipVia.ShipperID] node. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple conditions, and in this case, it checks if the two specified nodes have the same value, which is often used in database queries or logical operations to ensure data consistency or to filter results based on matching criteria.
