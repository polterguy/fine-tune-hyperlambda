/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.dp` in the current context. It is typically used to access a specific node that is known to exist within the current execution graph. Use case: Accessing a specific data node that holds important information for further processing.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the `.dp` node is another node, and it retrieves this node by reference. Use case: Accessing the actual node referenced by the `.dp` node's value, allowing for direct manipulation of its children.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. Use case: Accessing all properties or attributes of a node that is being referenced, often used to iterate over or inspect multiple child nodes.
 * 
 * 4. `is_nullable` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `is_nullable`. Use case: Checking or processing nodes that specifically indicate whether a value or field is nullable, which is common in database schema representations or data validation processes.
