// This Hyperlambda code sets the default value of a node's type to "string" if it doesn't already exist or has a null value. It uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of nodes referenced by the expression [@.arg/*/schema/*/type] to "string". This ensures that the type is explicitly set to "string" in the specified node path.
