// This code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] and [math.add] slots to update a node's value by adding a dynamically referenced value to it. The [set-value] slot changes the value of the [.total] node, while [math.add] adds the current value of [.total] to the value of the node referenced by [.dp/#]. This is useful for accumulating values in iterative processes.
set-value:x:@.total
   math.add:x:@.total
      .:x:@.dp/#
