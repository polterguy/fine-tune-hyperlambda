// This Hyperlambda code takes the first node under [.bars], retrieves its previous sibling, and splits its value by commas using [strings.split]. The result is added as a child to the node referenced by the expression in [add]. The [strings.split] slot splits the string into multiple nodes, each containing a part of the original string separated by commas.
