// 1. `@.phrase`: This iterator searches for the first node named "phrase" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first match it finds. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name that is located somewhere above the current node in the hierarchy, allowing you to retrieve its value or perform operations on it.
