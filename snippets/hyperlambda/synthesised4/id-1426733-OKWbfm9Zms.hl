// The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expression provided in its value before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this case, the expression "+/**" is evaluated, which typically refers to the current node and all its descendants. This results in the node being "unwrapped" or evaluated, allowing its value to be accessed or modified before the node is actually processed in the Hyperlambda execution flow.
unwrap:x:+/**
