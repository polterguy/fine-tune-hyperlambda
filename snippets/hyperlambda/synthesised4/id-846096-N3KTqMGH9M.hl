/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use [set-value] to modify the value of a node by replacing a specific substring within it. The [strings.replace] slot is utilized to find and replace occurrences of a specified substring within the target node's value. The replacement string is retrieved using [get-value] from the [.arguments] node. Below is a detailed breakdown of the slots involved:
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a substring within a string.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a node specified by its expression.
