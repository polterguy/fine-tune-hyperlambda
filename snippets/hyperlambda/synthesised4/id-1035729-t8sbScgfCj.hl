// 1. `@.res` - This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which indicates that it will search for the first node with the name "res" in the current context. The `.` following the `@` specifies that the search should begin from the current node's context, looking for a sibling or ancestor node named "res". This type of iterator is useful when you need to retrieve a specific node by name within a local scope, such as when you want to access a particular configuration or data node that is expected to be nearby in the node hierarchy.
