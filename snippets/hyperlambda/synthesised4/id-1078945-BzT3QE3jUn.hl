/*
 * - `@.arguments`: This iterator looks for the first node named "arguments" that is either a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It is used to locate the node where arguments for a function or operation are typically stored.
 * - `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access the individual argument nodes within the "arguments" node.
 * - `webhook_outgoing_url`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "webhook_outgoing_url". It is used to specifically target the node that holds the outgoing webhook URL.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * 1. This expression can be used in a webhook processing function to retrieve the URL to which outgoing webhook requests should be sent.
 * 2. It can be used to validate or log the outgoing webhook URL before making a network request to ensure the URL is correctly configured.
