// This Hyperlambda code evaluates two conditions using logical operators. The first condition checks if the count of child nodes under the first node of [csv2lambda] is greater than one. The second condition uses logical AND to ensure that the first node's value does not start with "http://" or "https://". If either the first condition is true or both parts of the second condition are true, the overall expression evaluates to true.
