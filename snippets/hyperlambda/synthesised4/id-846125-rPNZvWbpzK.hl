/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates a [while] loop that continues executing as long as the count of nodes under [hyper2lambda] is greater than the value of [convert]. Within the loop, it removes the first node from [hyper2lambda] using [remove-nodes]. 
 * 
 * 1. [while] - Initiates a loop that runs as long as the specified condition is true.
 * 2. [mt] - Checks if the count of nodes under [hyper2lambda] is greater than the value of [convert].
 * 3. [get-count] - Retrieves the number of nodes under [hyper2lambda].
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [convert] node.
 * 5. [.lambda] - Contains the code block that executes during each iteration of the loop.
 * 6. [remove-nodes] - Removes the first node from [hyper2lambda] during each loop iteration.
