// This Hyperlambda code uses the [add] slot to append nodes from multiple source nodes to multiple destination nodes simultaneously. The [add] slot targets all [.dest] nodes within the parent directory, and [get-nodes] retrieves all children of [.src] nodes, appending them to each [.dest] node. This allows for efficient duplication of node structures across multiple destinations.
