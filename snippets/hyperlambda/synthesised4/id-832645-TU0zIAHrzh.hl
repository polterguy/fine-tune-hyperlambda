// The code uses the [yield] slot to return the results of two operations: [rag_functions] and [system_functions]. The [yield] slot is typically used in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints to return values or node lists, automatically evaluating all inner expressions. This allows the caller to receive the output of both [rag_functions] and [system_functions] after their execution.
