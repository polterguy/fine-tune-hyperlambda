// This Hyperlambda code snippet converts a lambda object located at [.session] into a Hyperlambda string representation. The [lambda2hyper] slot is used to serialize the lambda structure, allowing it to be transferred, stored, or manipulated as plain text. The expression [x:@.session/*] specifies the location of the lambda object to be serialized.
lambda2hyper:x:@.session/*
