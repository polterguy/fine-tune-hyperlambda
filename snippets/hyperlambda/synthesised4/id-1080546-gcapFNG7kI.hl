/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by locating the first node named [.arguments] from the current node's context. It is typically used in Hyperlambda to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is useful for accessing each argument node individually, regardless of their specific names.
 * 
 * 3. `aggregate_function` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to find the first node with the name [aggregate_function]. It is used to specifically target the node that contains the aggregate function argument.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or endpoint to retrieve the value of a specific argument named [aggregate_function] passed to it. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to perform operations based on the type of aggregation function specified, such as sum, average, or count, in a data processing or reporting task.
