// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.select] slot to execute a SQL query that retrieves the "prompt" and "completion" fields from the "ml_requests" table. It filters the results based on a specific user ID, questionnaire value, and finish reason, using a parameterized query to safely pass the user ID.
data.select:"select prompt, completion from ml_requests where user_id = @user_id and questionnaire = 1 and finish_reason = 'questionnaire'"
   @user_id:x:@.dp/#/*/user_id
