// This Hyperlambda code snippet calculates the maximum value among the nodes [a], [b], and [c] located within the [inputs] node. It uses the [math.max] slot to determine the highest value and then updates the current node's value with this maximum value using the [set-value] slot. The [get-value] slot retrieves the values of [a], [b], and [c] for comparison.
