/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [remove-nodes] slot to remove specific nodes from a node structure. The expression provided to [remove-nodes] targets nodes within a hierarchy, specifically those under a [signal] node, with a child node named [db] having a value equal to "model". This operation effectively cleans up or prunes the node structure by removing unwanted or unnecessary nodes matching the criteria.
 * 
 * 1. [remove-nodes] - Removes nodes that match the specified expression.
 * 2. [x:@signal/*/*/db/=model] - Expression targeting nodes under [signal] with a [db] child node having the value "model".
