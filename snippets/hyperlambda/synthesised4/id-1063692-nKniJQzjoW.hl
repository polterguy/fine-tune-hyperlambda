/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" starting from the current node and searching upwards in the hierarchy. It is often used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which typically contains input parameters for a function or an endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node(s). In this context, it retrieves all children of the "arguments" node, which would be all the input parameters provided to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `seed` - This iterator filters the previously selected node(s) to only include nodes with the name "seed". It is used to specifically target the "seed" parameter within the arguments, assuming such a parameter exists.
