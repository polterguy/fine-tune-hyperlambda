// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator begins by searching for the first node named `.sql` within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it should look for a node with the specified name. This is useful in scenarios where you want to retrieve or manipulate a specific node by its name in a Hyperlambda structure. The context in which this is used could involve accessing SQL-related data or configurations stored within a node named `.sql`.
