/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to return multiple nodes, specifically [urls], [snippets], and [meta], as part of a response or result. The [return] slot is used to specify the nodes that should be included in the output. Each node can represent a different type of information or data structure, and the [return] slot ensures that these nodes are evaluated and returned as part of the execution flow.
 * // 
 * // 1. [return]: This slot is used to specify the nodes that should be returned as part of the execution result.
 * // 2. [urls]: This node likely contains information related to URLs, such as a list of URLs or URL-related data.
 * // 3. [snippets]: This node likely contains code snippets or related data, possibly representing small pieces of code or examples.
 * // 4. [meta]: This node likely contains meta information, which could include metadata about the execution, data structure, or other relevant details.
