// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each child node of [.numbers] using [for-each], and for each iteration, it updates the value of [.total] by adding the current value of [.total] to the value of the iterated node. The [set-value] slot is used to update [.total], and [math.add] performs the addition operation. The [.dp] node is used to reference the current node being iterated.
