// The code uses the [eq] slot to check if the value of the node pointed to by the expression `@.dp/#/*/notnull` is equal to the long integer value 1. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the specified node, and [eq] compares it to the provided static value. If they are equal, the [eq] slot evaluates to true.
