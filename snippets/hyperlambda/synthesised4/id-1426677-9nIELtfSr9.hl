// The [unwrap] slot is used to forward evaluate expressions in Hyperlambda before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the expression "x:+/*/*" is evaluated, and the result is assigned to the node where [unwrap] is used. This allows for dynamic evaluation of node expressions, effectively replacing the [unwrap] node with the evaluated result.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
