/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful when you need to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda execution context, typically at the beginning of a lambda expression or slot execution.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `prompt` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "prompt" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically access the "prompt" argument within the arguments node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or endpoint to access a specific argument named "prompt" that is passed to the slot or endpoint. This is useful in scenarios where the "prompt" argument contains important data or instructions that need to be processed or evaluated within the Hyperlambda logic.
