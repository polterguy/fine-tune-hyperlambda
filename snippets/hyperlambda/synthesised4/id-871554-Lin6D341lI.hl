// The code demonstrates how to use the [throw] slot in Hyperlambda to raise an exception. It retrieves the value of a node using a lambda expression and throws an exception with that value as the message. The [throw] slot is used for error handling, allowing the developer to specify custom error messages and propagate exceptions within the Hyperlambda execution flow.
