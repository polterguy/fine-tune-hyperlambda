// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.channel] node to the first element of a string split operation. The [set-value] slot changes the value of the [.channel] node, while the [get-value] slot retrieves the first element (index 0) from the result of a [strings.split] operation. The [strings.split] operation is assumed to have been executed previously, resulting in a list of strings.
set-value:x:@.channel
