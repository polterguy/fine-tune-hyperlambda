// This Hyperlambda code constructs a URL by concatenating a base URL with a path extracted from a node. The [set-value] slot updates the [.url] node with the result of the [strings.concat] operation. The [strings.concat] slot combines the base URL, a slash, and a path obtained using [get-value] with a complex expression that navigates through nodes to find the desired path. The expression in [get-value] uses iterators to locate a specific node's attribute value, which is then appended to the base URL.
