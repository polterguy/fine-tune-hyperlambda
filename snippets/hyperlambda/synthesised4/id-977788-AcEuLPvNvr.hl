// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [http.patch] slot to send a PATCH request to a URL specified by the [.url] node. It includes a [payload] node that contains an [email] node, which is dynamically set to the value of the [newEmail] node located within the [.arguments] node. This setup allows for updating an email address at the specified endpoint.
http.patch:x:@.url
   payload
      email:x:@.arguments/*/newEmail
