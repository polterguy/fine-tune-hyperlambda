// This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database named "shopping-cart-demo" and performs a read operation on the "items" table. It joins the "items" table with the "products" table using a left join on the "product_id" field. It selects the count of items, aliases it as "count", and limits the results to one record. The code also includes a mechanism to add additional where conditions from arguments and returns the nodes from the data read operation.
