/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is used to query a database table named "ml_requests". It selects the "completion" and "cached" columns where the "prompt" and "type" fields match the values provided in the arguments. The query limits the result to 1 record, ordered by the "created" column in descending order. Below is a breakdown of the slots used:
 * 
 * 1. [data.read] - Initiates the database read operation.
 * 2. [table] - Specifies the table to query, "ml_requests".
 * 3. [columns] - Lists the columns to be selected, "completion" and "cached".
 * 4. [where] - Defines the conditions for filtering the records.
 * 5. [and] - Combines multiple conditions that must all be true.
 * 6. [prompt.eq] - Compares the "prompt" field to the argument provided.
 * 7. [type.eq] - Compares the "type" field to the argument provided.
 * 8. [limit] - Restricts the query to return only 1 record.
 * 9. [order] - Specifies the column "created" for ordering the results.
 * 10. [direction] - Sets the order direction to descending.
