/*
 * 1. `@strings.split` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "strings.split" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node that likely contains a string value or operation related to splitting strings.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all the children nodes of the "strings.split" node. It is used to access the individual components or parameters that are part of the "strings.split" operation, such as the string to be split and the delimiter.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to process or analyze the parts of a string that has been split into multiple segments. For instance, if "strings.split" is used to divide a CSV line into separate fields, the `*` iterator would allow you to access each field individually for further processing or validation.
