/*
 * 1. `@.has-robots`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "has-robots" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings. It will return the first match it finds. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to check if a specific feature or condition (indicated by the "has-robots" node) is present in the current context or any of its ancestors, which might be useful in scenarios where you need to determine if a certain capability (like "robots") is enabled or configured in a hierarchical data structure.
