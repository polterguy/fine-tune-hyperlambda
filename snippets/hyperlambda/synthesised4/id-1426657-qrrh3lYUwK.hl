 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of a node referenced by the expression [@.found] to a boolean value of true. It effectively updates the node's value to indicate a true state or condition. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node(s) referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [@.found] - Expression pointing to the node whose value will be set.
 * 3. [.:bool:true] - The new boolean value to assign to the node.
