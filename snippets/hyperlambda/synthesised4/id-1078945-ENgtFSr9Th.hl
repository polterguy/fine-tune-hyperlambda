// 1. `@.result`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "result" starting from the current node's context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name. The `.` before "result" specifies that it should start the search from the current node's context or hierarchy. This expression is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate the value of a node named "result" within the current context, such as checking the outcome of a computation or operation stored in a "result" node.
