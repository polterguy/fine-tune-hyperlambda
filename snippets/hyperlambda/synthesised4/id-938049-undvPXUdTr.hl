// The code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes from a specific path to a lambda object and then retrieve nodes from a transformed Hyperlambda text. It uses [add] to incorporate nodes from a relative path into a task's lambda, and [get-nodes] to extract nodes from the result of a [hyper2lambda] transformation.
