/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you need to navigate upwards in the node hierarchy to access or manipulate the parent node's properties or children.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is commonly used to access all child nodes of a particular node, allowing you to perform operations on each child.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "data.read" from the previous result set. It is typically used to filter nodes by name, focusing on nodes that are specifically related to reading data.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Similar to the previous `*` iterator, this retrieves all children nodes of the "data.read" nodes. It allows further navigation down the hierarchy to access more specific data or operations.
 * 
 * 5. `where` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "where" from the previous result set. It is often used in query-like operations to filter nodes based on certain conditions or criteria.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This final `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "where" nodes. It is useful for accessing the specific conditions or parameters defined within the "where" clause, enabling further processing or evaluation of these conditions.
