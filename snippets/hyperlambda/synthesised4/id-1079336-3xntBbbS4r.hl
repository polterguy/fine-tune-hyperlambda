/*
 * 1. `@data.select`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "data.select" in the current context. It starts the expression by locating this specific node, which serves as the root for further navigation.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.select" node. It expands the search to include every direct child node under "data.select", allowing the expression to navigate through the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of each node found in the previous step. It further drills down into the hierarchy, accessing the children of each child node under "data.select".
 * 
 * 4. `keyword_density`: This iterator filters the nodes obtained from the previous step to only include those with the name "keyword_density". It narrows down the results to nodes specifically named "keyword_density", which are descendants of the "data.select" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a text analysis application to find and process nodes related to keyword density within a larger data structure. 
 * - It might be useful in SEO tools to extract and analyze keyword density metrics from a dataset structured under a "data.select" node.
