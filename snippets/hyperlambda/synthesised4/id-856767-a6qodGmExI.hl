// This Hyperlambda code uses logical conditions to evaluate two expressions. The [and] slot ensures both conditions must be true: [not-null] checks if the URI node within the current data path has a value, and [not-exists] verifies that no existing URI in the result matches the current URI. This is useful for ensuring unique URIs are processed.
