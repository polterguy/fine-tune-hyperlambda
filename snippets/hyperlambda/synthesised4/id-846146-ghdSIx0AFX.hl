/*
 * The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a destination node's children collection. It retrieves nodes using [get-nodes] from specific paths and adds them to the destination node. The [add] slot's expression determines the destination, and the retrieved nodes are appended to it.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the destination node's children collection.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the specified paths in the expression.
 * 3. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the specified paths in the expression.
