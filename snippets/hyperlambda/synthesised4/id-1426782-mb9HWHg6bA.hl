/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to concatenate a username and a secret with a colon ":" in between, and set the result as the value of an [.auth] node. The process involves retrieving the values of the [username] and [secret] nodes from the [.arguments] node, concatenating them with a colon, and then using the [set-value] slot to assign this concatenated string to the [.auth] node.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.auth] node to the result of the concatenation.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates the username, a colon, and the secret into a single string.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/username] - Retrieves the value of the [username] node from the [.arguments] node.
 * 4. [.:":"] - A static node representing the colon ":" character to be inserted between the username and secret.
 * 5. [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/secret] - Retrieves the value of the [secret] node from the [.arguments] node.
