// 1. `@.outgoing`: This iterator searches for the first node named "outgoing" within the current context. It starts the search from the current node and looks for a sibling or a child node with the name "outgoing". This is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate data specifically associated with an "outgoing" node, such as sending data to an external system or logging outgoing messages.
