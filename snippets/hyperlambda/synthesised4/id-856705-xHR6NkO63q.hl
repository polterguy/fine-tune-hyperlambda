// This Hyperlambda code snippet replaces double spaces with a single space in the value of the [.anchor] node. The [set-value] slot updates the [.anchor] node's value, while [strings.replace] searches for occurrences of double spaces and substitutes them with a single space. The process ensures that any extra spaces in the [.anchor] node's value are condensed into a single space.
