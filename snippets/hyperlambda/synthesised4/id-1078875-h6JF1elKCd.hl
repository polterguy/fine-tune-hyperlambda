/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It is used to locate the `.arguments` node in the hierarchy, which typically contains input parameters or arguments for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each individual argument node within the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `type` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `type` among the children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to specifically target nodes that represent the type of each argument.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract the type information of arguments passed to a function or endpoint, which can be useful for validation or processing based on argument types.
 * - It can be utilized in dynamic slot creation or execution scenarios where argument types need to be checked or logged for debugging purposes.
