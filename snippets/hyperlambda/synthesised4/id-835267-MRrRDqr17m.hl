// The [invoke] slot executes a lambda object as if it were a dynamic slot, allowing you to pass arguments and receive nodes back. It treats the lambda object as immutable, meaning it doesn't modify the original lambda. The [invoke] slot is useful for executing isolated lambda objects with specific arguments, ensuring no external state is altered during execution.
