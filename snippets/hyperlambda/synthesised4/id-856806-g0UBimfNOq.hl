// This code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to concatenate a series of strings and set the result as the value of the [.fk] node. The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine several values, including existing values from [.fk], static strings, and values retrieved from nodes using [get-value]. The concatenated string forms a foreign key reference statement. The [else] slot ensures this block is executed only if preceding conditions are not met.
