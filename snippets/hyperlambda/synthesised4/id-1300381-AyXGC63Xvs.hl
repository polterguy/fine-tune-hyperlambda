// This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL read operation on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "Employees" table. It uses a left join to connect the "Employees" table with itself, aliasing the joined table as "ReportsTo". The join condition is based on matching the "ReportsTo" column from the "Employees" table with the "EmployeeID" column of the aliased "ReportsTo" table. This setup is typically used to find hierarchical relationships within the same table, such as employee-manager relationships. The code specifies a column with an "aggregate_functor" to be selected, which is aliased as "result". The use of "aggregate_functor" suggests that an aggregate function (like COUNT, SUM, etc.) is intended, although the specific function is not detailed in the code snippet. The "where" clause is present but does not specify any conditions, indicating that it might be a placeholder for future conditions. The "limit" is set to 1, meaning only one result will be returned. Finally, the code uses "return-nodes" to output the result of the read operation. This setup is useful for retrieving specific hierarchical data from a table with a self-referential structure, often used in organizational databases to map out reporting structures.
