// The code uses the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve all child nodes of the [.origin2] node. The expression "@.origin2/*" specifies the path to the [.origin2] node and selects all its children. This operation is useful for accessing and manipulating a specific subset of nodes within a larger node structure.
