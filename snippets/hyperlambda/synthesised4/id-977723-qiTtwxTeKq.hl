// The code demonstrates the use of the [switch] slot to perform conditional logic based on the value of [.val]. It evaluates the value of [.val] and executes the corresponding [case] block, setting the [.result] node's value to "Oops" if [.val] is "bar" and "Success!" if [.val] is "foo". The [switch] slot allows for clean and efficient branching based on multiple potential values.
switch:x:@.val
   case:bar
      set-value:x:@.result
         .:Oops
   case:foo
      set-value:x:@.result
         .:Success!
