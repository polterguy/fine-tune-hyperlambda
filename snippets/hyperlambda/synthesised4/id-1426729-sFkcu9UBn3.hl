/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement with multiple [case] slots to handle different conditions. The [switch] statement evaluates the value of the [h5] node and executes the corresponding [case] block based on the value. If none of the [case] conditions match, the [default] block is executed. This allows for conditional branching based on the value of [h5].
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Initiates a switch statement to evaluate the value of [h5].
 * 2. [case] - Specifies a condition to match against the value of [h5].
 * 3. [default] - Executes if none of the [case] conditions match.
