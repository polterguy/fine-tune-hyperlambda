// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a left join between the "Medications" and "Patients" tables in an SQLite database using the [data.read] slot. It specifies the join condition on the "PatientID" field and aliases the "Patients" table as "PatientID". The [columns] slot includes a distinct functor, and the [where] slot is prepared for additional conditions. The [database-type] is set to SQLite, indicating the type of database being queried.
