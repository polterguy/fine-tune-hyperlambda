// This code snippet uses the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions: it checks if the [filename] node within the current [.dp] node is not null using [not-null], and if the file specified by [filename] exists using [io.file.exists]. Both conditions must be true for the [and] slot to evaluate to true.
