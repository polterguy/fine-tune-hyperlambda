// The code snippet sets an HTTP response header to control caching behavior. By using the [response.headers.set] slot, it specifies the "Cache-Control" header with a value of "public, max-age=300", indicating that the response can be cached by any cache and should be considered fresh for 300 seconds. This configuration helps manage client-side and intermediary caching of the HTTP response.
