// The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to the "root" role. If the user is not part of this role, an exception is thrown, effectively restricting access to users with the specified role. This is typically used in HTTP endpoints to ensure that only authorized users with the necessary roles can access certain functionalities.
