// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to modify the value of a node by replacing a specific substring within it. The [set-value] slot is used to change the value of the [.type] node. The [strings.replace] slot is employed to remove the substring "https://" from the current value of [.type]. The result is that any occurrence of "https://" in the [.type] node's value is replaced with an empty string, effectively removing it.
