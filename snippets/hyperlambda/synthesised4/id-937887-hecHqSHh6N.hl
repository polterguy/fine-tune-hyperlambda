// This Hyperlambda code uses the [switch] slot to evaluate the value of the [.available] node. It contains two [case] slots: one for when [.available] is true, setting [.result] to "Car part is available", and another for when [.available] is false, setting [.result] to "Car part is not available". The [switch] slot allows for conditional branching based on the value of [.available].
switch:x:@.available
   case:bool:true
      set-value:x:@.result
         .:Car part is available
   case:bool:false
      set-value:x:@.result
         .:Car part is not available
