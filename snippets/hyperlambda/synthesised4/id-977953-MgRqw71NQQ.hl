// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database named "media_library" and executes a SQL query to select all records from the "videos" table using [data.select]. The results are then added to a node named [.video-collection] using [add], with [get-nodes] retrieving all records from the executed query.
data.connect:media_library
   data.select:select * from videos
   add:x:@.video-collection
      get-nodes:x:@data.select/*
