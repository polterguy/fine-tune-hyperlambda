// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to add a new node to a specified location in the node structure. The [add] slot is used to insert a new node named [referrer] at the location specified by the expression "./*/signal". The expression "./*/signal" targets the [signal] node within the current node's children, and the [referrer] node is added as a child of this [signal] node. The [referrer] node itself is defined with an expression pointing to another node named [referrer], allowing for dynamic referencing or copying of node values or structures.
