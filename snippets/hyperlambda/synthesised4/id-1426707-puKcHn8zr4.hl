/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [pdf2text] slot to extract text from a PDF file. It takes the file path from the [.filepath] node and uses the [preserve-pages] argument to determine if page breaks should be preserved in the output text. The [preserve-pages] argument is retrieved from the [.arguments] node, specifically from the [preservePages] child node. The code effectively converts a PDF document into its text representation while optionally maintaining the original page structure.
 * 
 * 1. [pdf2text] - Extracts text from a PDF file.
 * 2. [x:@.filepath] - Specifies the file path of the PDF to be processed.
 * 3. [preserve-pages] - Determines if page breaks should be preserved in the output text.
 * 4. [x:@.arguments/*/preservePages] - Retrieves the value for the [preserve-pages] argument from the [.arguments] node.
