// The expression `unwrap:x:+/*` is used to forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied as a value to the `unwrap` slot. In this context, the expression is evaluating the node immediately following the current node in the sequence, which is the `return` node. The `+` iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node, and the `/*` retrieves all children of that node. This is useful when you need to ensure that the expressions within the children of the next node are evaluated before the node itself is processed. A potential use case for this expression is when you want to ensure that all dynamic values or expressions within a return block are computed and resolved before returning the final result, such as when preparing data to be sent back from a function or an API endpoint.
