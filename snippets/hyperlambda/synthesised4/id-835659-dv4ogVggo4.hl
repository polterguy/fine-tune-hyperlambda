// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds nodes retrieved from the [.arguments] node to the [where] clause of a [data.read] operation. The [add] slot is used to append these nodes, and the [get-nodes] slot fetches all nodes under [.arguments]. The operation is executed within the context of the current node hierarchy, targeting the [where] clause in a data reading process.
