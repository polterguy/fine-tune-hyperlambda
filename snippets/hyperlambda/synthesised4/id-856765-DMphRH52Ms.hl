// The [math.subtract] slot subtracts the value of [max_tokens] from 32768. This operation is useful for calculating the remaining tokens available by subtracting a used or reserved amount from a total. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of [max_tokens] from the [.model] node, allowing dynamic subtraction based on the current state of the node.
