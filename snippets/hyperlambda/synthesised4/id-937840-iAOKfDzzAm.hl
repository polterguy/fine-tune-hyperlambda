// This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database named "scraper" and performs a read operation on the "crawl_urls" table. It counts the number of entries in the table, applying a condition from the arguments if provided, and limits the result to one record. The final result is returned as nodes. The code uses slots like [data.connect] to establish a connection, [add] to include conditions dynamically, [data.read] to execute the read operation, and [return-nodes] to return the results.
