// The [unwrap] slot in this Hyperlambda code is used to evaluate the expression before the node where it's referenced is reached. The expression "x:+" indicates that it will evaluate the next node in sequence. This is useful for ensuring that the value is computed or retrieved before being used in subsequent operations.
