// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of [.score] is less than or equal to 50 and if [.completed] is true. If both conditions are met, it sets the value of [.result] to "eligible for retry". The [if] slot evaluates the combined conditions using [and], and the [lte] and [get-value] slots are used to perform the comparisons.
