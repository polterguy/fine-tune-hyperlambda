// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. The [else] slot is executed when all preceding [if] and [else-if] conditions evaluate to false. In this example, it sets the value of the [.status] node to "Operation failed" using the [set-value] slot. This is typically used as a fallback action when none of the specified conditions are met.

   set-value:x:@.status
      .:Operation failed
