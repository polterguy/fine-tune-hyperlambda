// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" in the current context. It uses the "@" symbol to indicate that it should search for a node by name, and the "." symbol specifies that it should look in the current context or scope. This is useful for retrieving a specific node that holds SQL-related information or commands, which can then be used for further processing or execution in the Hyperlambda script.
