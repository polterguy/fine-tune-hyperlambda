// The provided code snippet demonstrates how to use the [convert] slot to change the type of a node's value to base64 encoding. The [convert] slot takes an expression pointing to the node to be converted and a [type] argument specifying the desired conversion type. In this case, the conversion type is set to "base64", which will encode the value of the node using base64 encoding.
type:base64
