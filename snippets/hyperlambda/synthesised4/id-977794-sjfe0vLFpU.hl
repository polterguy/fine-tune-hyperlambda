// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a "users" table, applying a filter condition to select records where the "id" field matches a specified "user-id" argument. The [data.read] slot is used to execute a SQL SELECT operation, and the [where] clause with [and] and [id.eq] is employed to define the filtering criteria based on the "user-id" provided in the arguments.
data.read
   table:users
   where
      and
         id.eq:x:@.arguments/*/user-id
