// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [image.generate-qr] slot to create a QR code. It takes two arguments: [url], which specifies the content to be encoded in the QR code, and [size], which determines the dimensions of the QR code. The QR code is generated based on these inputs, allowing it to be returned or saved as needed.
image.generate-qr:x:@.arguments/*/url
   size:x:@.arguments/*/size
