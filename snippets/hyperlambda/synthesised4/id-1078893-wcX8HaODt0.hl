/*
 * 1. `@cache` - This iterator searches for the first node named "cache" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, to find a node with this specific name. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate data stored in a node named "cache" that may not be a direct child of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `count` - After locating the "cache" node, this iterator looks for a child node named "count" within the "cache" node. It retrieves this specific child node, which presumably holds a value related to counting or tallying some items or events.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve the number of items stored in a cache, which is useful for monitoring cache usage or determining when to clear or expand the cache.
 * - It might also be used in scenarios where you need to log or display the current count of cached items for debugging or reporting purposes.
