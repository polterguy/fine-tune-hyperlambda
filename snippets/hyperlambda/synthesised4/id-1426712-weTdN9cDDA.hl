// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a signal to a specific session. It sends a message with an argument named [function_error], which contains the value from the [message] node within the [.arguments] node. This is typically used to notify a specific session about an error or issue that occurred, passing the error message as a JSON string to the client connected to the session.
