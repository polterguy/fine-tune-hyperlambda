// The Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [case] slot to check if an integer value is 5, and if true, it sets the value of the [.result] node to "Value is five". The [case] slot is typically used within a [switch] block to handle specific cases, but here it is used standalone to demonstrate setting a value based on a condition.
case:int:5
   set-value:x:@.result
      .:Value is five
