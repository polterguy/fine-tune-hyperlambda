/*
 * The expression `@io.file.load` is a lambda expression in Hyperlambda. Let's break down the components:
 * 
 * 1. `@` - This is the "name" iterator. It retrieves the first node with the specified name that follows the "@" character. In this case, it looks for the first node named "io.file.load" within the current context or hierarchy. This iterator is useful when you want to directly access a specific node by its name, especially when you know the exact name of the node you are looking for.
 * 
 * 2. `io.file.load` - This is the name of the node being retrieved. In the context of Hyperlambda, "io.file.load" likely refers to a slot or function related to file loading operations. The exact functionality would depend on the implementation of this slot in the Hyperlambda environment. This part is crucial when you want to perform operations related to file loading, such as reading the contents of a file or accessing file metadata.
 * 
 * The combination of these components allows you to directly access and potentially execute or manipulate the node named "io.file.load" within your Hyperlambda code. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to perform file operations as part of your logic.
