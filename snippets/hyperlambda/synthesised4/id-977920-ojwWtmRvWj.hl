// This Hyperlambda code sends an email with an attachment using the [mail.smtp.send] slot. It constructs a MIME message with a recipient's email dynamically retrieved from the [.arguments] node, sets the subject, and includes a plain text entity with a message and a Markdown file attachment. The [entity] nodes define the email's content and attachment, while the [filename] node specifies the path to the file being attached.
