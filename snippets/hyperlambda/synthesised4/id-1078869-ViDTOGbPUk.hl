/*
 * 1. `@.extra`: This iterator searches for the first node named "extra" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "extra" node it encounters, allowing you to access its children or value. This is useful when you need to retrieve data or configurations that are stored in a parent node named "extra".
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "extra" node. It is used to access the entire set of children nodes under "extra", which can be useful if you need to process or iterate over multiple data elements stored within "extra".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration settings stored under a node named "extra" and iterating over each setting to apply them.
 * - Retrieving a list of additional data elements or metadata associated with a primary data node, where "extra" acts as a container for these elements.
