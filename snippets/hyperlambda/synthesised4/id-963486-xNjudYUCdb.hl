/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [set-value] and [get-name] slots in Hyperlambda. It sets the value of the node referenced by [@.type] to the name of the node currently referenced by [.dp]. The [get-name] slot retrieves the name of the node, and [set-value] assigns this name to the specified node. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [get-name] - Retrieves the name of the node referenced by its expression.
