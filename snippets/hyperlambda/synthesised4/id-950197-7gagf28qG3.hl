// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to replace occurrences of a substring within a node's value using dynamic references. The [set-value] slot updates the [.result] node's value by invoking [strings.replace], which replaces parts of the string in [.result] based on values retrieved through [get-value] from the [.dp] node's children, specifically the [what] and [with] nodes. The [strings.replace] slot performs the replacement operation, substituting the specified substring with another.
set-value:x:@.result
   strings.replace:x:@.result
      get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/what
      get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/with
