/*
 * This expression is a lambda expression used to navigate a Hyperlambda node structure. Let's break down each part of the expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@.lambda` - This iterator starts by finding the first node with the name "lambda" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "lambda" node. It effectively expands the search to include every child node under "lambda".
 * 
 * 3. `lambda2hyper` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "lambda2hyper" that are children of the previously selected nodes. It narrows down the search to specific nodes of interest.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "lambda2hyper" nodes. It expands the search once more to include all child nodes under each "lambda2hyper" node.
 * 
 * 5. `modules` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "modules" that are children of the previously selected nodes. It further narrows down the search to nodes specifically named "modules".
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression:
 * - This expression could be used to extract or manipulate configuration or metadata related to modules within a Hyperlambda application, assuming the structure contains nodes named "lambda", "lambda2hyper", and "modules".
 * - It might be used in a scenario where you need to gather information about modules defined under a specific context or hierarchy in a Hyperlambda-based system.
