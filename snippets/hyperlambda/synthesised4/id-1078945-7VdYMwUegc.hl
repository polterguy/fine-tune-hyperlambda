/*
 * 1. `@.token`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "token" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches upwards in the node structure to find this node. 
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression can be used in scenarios where you need to access a specific configuration or data node named "token" that is defined earlier in the Hyperlambda script. For example, it might be used to retrieve an authentication token or a session identifier that was set at the beginning of the script.
