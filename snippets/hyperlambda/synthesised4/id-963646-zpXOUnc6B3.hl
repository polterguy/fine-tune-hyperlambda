/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the content of a file loaded from the path specified in [io.file.load] contains the string "OpenAI". The [strings.contains] slot is used to perform this check, with the file content being the source string and "OpenAI" being the substring to search for. If the substring is found, the slot returns true. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.contains] - Checks if the specified string contains a given sequence of characters.
 * 2. [io.file.load] - Loads the content of a file from the specified path.
 * 3. [.] - Represents the substring "OpenAI" to search for within the file content.
