// The Hyperlambda code connects to an SQLite database and reads data from the "Medications" table, performing a left join with the "Patients" table based on the "PatientID". It selects distinct records using a functor, aliasing the result as "count". The [where] clause is prepared for additional conditions. The [join] operation is specified with a left join type, and the [columns] node uses a distinct functor to aggregate results.
