// The code demonstrates the use of the [return-nodes] slot to return a set of nodes from a dynamic slot or a context that supports returning nodes. In this example, it returns a single node with the name [has-sitemap] and a boolean value of false. This slot is typically used to return complex data structures from dynamic slots or other contexts that allow node returns.
