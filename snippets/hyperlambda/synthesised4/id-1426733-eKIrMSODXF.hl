// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot in Hyperlambda to retrieve the type of a node's value. In this example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to determine the type of the node's value, which will return "int" as the type name. This is useful for dynamically inspecting and verifying the data types of nodes within a Hyperlambda script.
