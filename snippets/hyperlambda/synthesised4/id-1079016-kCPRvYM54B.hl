/*
 * 1. `@.channel`: This iterator searches for the first node named "channel" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, looking for a node with the specified name. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression is useful when you need to access or modify the "channel" node that is an ancestor of the current node. 
 * - It can be used in scenarios where you need to retrieve configuration or settings stored in a "channel" node that applies to the current context.
