/*
 * 1. `@.function-result`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "function-result" that is an ancestor or sibling of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it will traverse upwards and sideways in the hierarchy to find the node. This is useful when you want to access a specific node that is not a direct child or when the node might be located at various levels in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the result of a function execution that is stored in a node named "function-result" after the function has been executed.
 * - Accessing a node that contains the output of a previously executed operation, which is stored in a node named "function-result" for further processing or validation.
