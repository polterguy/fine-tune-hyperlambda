// This code calculates the average score by dividing the total score by the number of categories for each node under [.scores]. It uses [set-value] to assign the result of [math.divide] to the [average] node for each child of [.scores]. The [math.divide] slot takes the total score and the number of categories as inputs, retrieved using [get-value].
