// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-x] slot to modify the type of a node's value. It first retrieves the value using a lambda expression with [exists] and then converts it using [convert] to a specified type, which is determined by concatenating strings with [strings.concat]. The [set-x] slot is used to set the modified value back to the node.
set-x:x:+/*/*/exists
   convert:x:@strings.concat
      type:x
