// This Hyperlambda code establishes a connection to the "logistics_db" database and reads data from the "shipments" table. The retrieved data is then added to a node named "delivery-queue". The [data.connect] slot is used to open the database connection, while [data.read] is used to select records from the specified table. The [add] slot appends the results to the "delivery-queue" node.
