// This Hyperlambda code attempts to connect to a database specified by the [.arguments] node, and checks if the database type is "mssql". If true, it renames the [data.execute] slot to [mssql.execute-batch] for batch execution. It then executes a script loaded from a file and logs a success message upon completion. The [try] block ensures that any errors during execution can be caught and handled appropriately.
