/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It looks for a node named "arguments" starting from the current node and going upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "arguments" node. It returns all direct child nodes of the node found in the previous step.
 * 
 * 3. `data` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "data". It selects nodes with the name "data" from the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda HTTP endpoint to access a specific "data" node within the arguments passed to the endpoint, allowing for processing or validation of the data contained within that node.
 * - It can also be used in a dynamic slot to retrieve and manipulate data passed as an argument, ensuring that only the relevant "data" node is accessed and processed.
