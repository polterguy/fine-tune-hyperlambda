// This Hyperlambda code checks if the status code of an HTTP POST request is less than 300, indicating a successful response. If the condition is true, it implies the request was successful, as HTTP status codes below 300 typically represent successful responses. The code uses the [lt] slot to perform the comparison, with [x:@http.post] retrieving the status code and [.:int:300] providing the threshold value for comparison.
lt:x:@http.post
   .:int:300
