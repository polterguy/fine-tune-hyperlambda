// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the value of the [aggregate_function] node is one of the predefined legal values. The validator checks if the value is either "min", "max", "sum", "avg", or "count", throwing an exception if it is not. This is useful for validating input against a set of allowed options, ensuring that only valid aggregate functions are used in subsequent operations.
