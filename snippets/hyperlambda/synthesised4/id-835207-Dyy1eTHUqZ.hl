// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.delete] slot to delete records from a database table named "ml_types". It specifies a [where] condition using [and] to ensure that only records with a "type" field equal to the value of the [.type] node are deleted. This ensures precise deletion based on the specified condition.
data.delete
   table:ml_types
   where
      and
         type.eq:x:@.type
