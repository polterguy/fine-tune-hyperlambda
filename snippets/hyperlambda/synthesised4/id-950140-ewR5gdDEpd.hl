/*
 * The code attempts to connect to a database using a specified connection string and database name, then reads from the "roles" table to check if a role with a specified name exists. If the role does not exist, it creates a new entry in the "roles" table with the provided role name and description. The [try] slot handles potential exceptions during the database operations.
 * 
 * 1. [try] - Attempts to execute the enclosed database operations, handling exceptions if they occur.
 * 2. [data.connect] - Opens a database connection using the specified connection string and database name.
 * 3. [data.read] - Reads data from the "roles" table with a condition on the role name.
 * 4. [table] - Specifies the table to read from, in this case, "roles".
 * 5. [where] - Filters the data read operation based on the role name.
 * 6. [and] - Combines multiple conditions, here it checks if the role name equals a specified argument.
 * 7. [name.eq] - Checks for equality between the role name and the provided argument.
 * 8. [if] - Conditional execution based on the existence of the role.
 * 9. [not] - Inverts the condition, checking if the role does not exist.
 * 10. [exists] - Checks if any records match the specified condition.
 * 11. [.lambda] - Executes the enclosed operations if the condition is met.
 * 12. [data.create] - Creates a new entry in the "roles" table if the role does not exist.
 * 13. [values] - Specifies the values for the new entry, including the role name and description.
