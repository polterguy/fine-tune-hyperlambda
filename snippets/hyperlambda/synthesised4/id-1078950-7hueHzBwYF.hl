/*
 * 1. `@.ids`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "ids" starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy. It does not traverse sibling nodes, only ancestors. This is useful for retrieving a specific node that is expected to be an ancestor of the current node, which might contain a list of identifiers or some configuration data.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access a list of identifiers stored in an ancestor node named "ids" to perform operations like filtering or validation based on these identifiers.
