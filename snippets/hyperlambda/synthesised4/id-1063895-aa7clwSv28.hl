/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which contains the input parameters for a slot or a function.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node(s). In this case, it retrieves all children of the "arguments" node. This is useful for iterating over all the arguments provided to a slot or function.
 * 
 * 3. `nullable` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved node set to only include nodes with the name "nullable". It is used to specifically target nodes that are named "nullable" among the children of the "arguments" node, which might represent optional or nullable parameters in the context of the function or slot execution.
