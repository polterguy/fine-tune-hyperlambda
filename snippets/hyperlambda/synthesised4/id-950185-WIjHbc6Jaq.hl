// This Hyperlambda snippet sets HTTP response headers to specify the content type as CSV and includes a Content-Disposition header, which is dynamically constructed using [strings.concat]. It also exposes the Content-Disposition header to CORS requests by setting Access-Control-Expose-Headers. This configuration is useful for controlling how the response is handled by clients, especially when dealing with file downloads.
