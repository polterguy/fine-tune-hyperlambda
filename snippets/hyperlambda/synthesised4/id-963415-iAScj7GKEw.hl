// This Hyperlambda code connects to a PostgreSQL database and executes a SQL query to calculate the average of the "amount" column from the "orders" table. The [pgsql.scalar] slot is used to return the result as a single scalar value, which is typically used for aggregate functions like average, sum, or count.
pgsql.scalar:select avg(amount) from orders
