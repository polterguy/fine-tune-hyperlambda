/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current context, starting from the root and moving downwards. It is useful for pinpointing a specific node when you know its name but not its exact location.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. It is often used when you want to perform operations on or inspect all direct descendants of a particular node.
 * 
 * 3. `total` - This filters the result set to only include nodes named "total" among the children of the "signal" node. This is useful when you are interested in a specific subset of children nodes that have a particular name.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a data structure representing signals, each with various attributes or metrics, and you want to extract or manipulate the "total" attribute of a specific signal. For example, in a monitoring system, this could be used to retrieve the total count or value of a specific signal type for further processing or analysis.
