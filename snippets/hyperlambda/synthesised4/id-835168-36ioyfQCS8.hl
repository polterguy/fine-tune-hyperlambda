// This Hyperlambda code verifies the authenticity of a given token by checking it against the provided token argument. If the token is invalid or not provided, the operation will throw an exception, ensuring that only valid tokens are processed. The [auth.token.verify] slot is used to confirm the token's validity, and the token is retrieved from the [.arguments] node.
