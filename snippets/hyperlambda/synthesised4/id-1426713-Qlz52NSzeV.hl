// This Hyperlambda code checks if the HTTP status code of a POST request is not in the range of 200 to 299. It uses the [not] slot to invert the result of an [and] condition, which checks if the status code is more than or equal to 200 and less than 300. If both conditions are true, the [and] slot returns true, but the [not] slot inverts this to false, indicating the status code is outside the successful range.
