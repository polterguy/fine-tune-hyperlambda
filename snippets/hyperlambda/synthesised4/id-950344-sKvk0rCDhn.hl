// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to modify the value of a node by concatenating strings. It uses [strings.concat] to combine a static string "Bearer " with the value of a [token] node retrieved from [.arguments]. The result is then set as the value of the node specified by the expression in [set-value].
set-value:x:-
   strings.concat
      .:"Bearer "
      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/token
