// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [completion] exists within the first child of the [scan] node, is not null, and contains a specific string pattern. It uses [and] to ensure all conditions are true, [exists] to verify the presence of the [completion] node, [not-null] to confirm it has a value, and [strings.contains] to check if the value includes a specified substring.
