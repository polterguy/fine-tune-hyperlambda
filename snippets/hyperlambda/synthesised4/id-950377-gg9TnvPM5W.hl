// The code uses the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions, both using the [eq] slot. The first condition checks if the value of a node referenced by [SOME_EXPRESSION] is equal to [SOME_VALUE]. The second condition checks if the value of another node, referenced by [SOME_OTHER_EXPRESSION], is equal to [SOME_OTHER_VALUE]. The [and] slot will return true only if both conditions evaluate to true.
