/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks for a sibling or a parent node with this name.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "signal" node found in the previous step. It allows the expression to access any direct children of the "signal" node.
 * 3. `snippets` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "snippets" from the children of the "signal" node. It ensures that only nodes with this specific name are considered in the next step.
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "snippets" node. It allows the expression to access any direct children of the "snippets" node.
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression might include:
 * - Extracting or processing all snippet-related data within a "signal" node structure, which could be useful in a system that handles code snippets or templates.
 * - Iterating over all snippets within a signal to perform operations like validation, transformation, or aggregation.
