/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [arguments] from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected [arguments] node. It allows you to access each argument node individually.
 * 
 * 3. `columnName` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "columnName" from the previously selected children nodes. It is used to specifically target the node that contains the value for the "columnName" argument.
