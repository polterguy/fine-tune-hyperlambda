/*
 * The Hyperlambda code uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a signal to a specific session, passing along arguments as JSON. It specifically sends a "finish_reason" argument, which is dynamically retrieved from the current context. This allows for real-time communication with a client or group of clients, notifying them of a specific event or status update related to the session. 
 * 
 * 1. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to a specific session.
 * 2. [args] - Contains the arguments to be sent as JSON.
 * 3. [finish_reason] - Retrieves the finish reason from the current context to be included in the signal.
