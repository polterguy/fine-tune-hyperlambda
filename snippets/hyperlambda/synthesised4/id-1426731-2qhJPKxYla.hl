// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate an expression before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied to the node immediately following it, indicated by the "+" iterator, which refers to the next sibling node. The "/*" expression is used to evaluate all children nodes of the referenced node. This allows for the forward evaluation of expressions inside the lambda object before the lambda object is actually executed.
