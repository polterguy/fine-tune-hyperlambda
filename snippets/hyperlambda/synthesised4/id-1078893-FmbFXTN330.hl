// 1. `@.default-db`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "default-db" that is an ancestor of the current node. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors up in the hierarchy. This is useful for retrieving configuration settings or database connection details that are defined higher up in the node hierarchy. A potential use case is when you have a configuration node named "default-db" that contains database connection information, and you need to access this information from a child node within the same hierarchy.
