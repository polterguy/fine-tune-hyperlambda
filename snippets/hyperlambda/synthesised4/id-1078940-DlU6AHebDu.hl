/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is used to locate the [.arguments] node, which typically contains input parameters or arguments for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each individual argument passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `forceAsText` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "forceAsText". It is used to specifically target the "forceAsText" argument, which may be used to determine whether certain data should be treated as text.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a function or endpoint to check if a specific argument named "forceAsText" is provided, which might control whether the output should be formatted as plain text rather than another data type.
 * - It could be part of a validation process to ensure that the "forceAsText" parameter is present before proceeding with operations that require text formatting.
