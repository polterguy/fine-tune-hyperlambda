/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet performs a conditional check to compare the lengths of two strings. If the length of the string referenced by [.lhs/#] is less than the length of the string referenced by [.rhs/#], it sets the value of [.result] to -1. The [if] slot is used to evaluate the condition, and the [lt] slot checks if the first argument is less than the second argument. The [strings.length] slot retrieves the length of the strings for comparison. The [set-value] slot assigns the result of the comparison to [.result] if the condition is true.
 * // 
 * // 1. [if] - Evaluates the condition and executes its children if true.
 * // 2. [lt] - Compares the lengths of two strings.
 * // 3. [strings.length:x:@.lhs/#] - Retrieves the length of the string referenced by [.lhs/#].
 * // 4. [strings.length:x:@.rhs/#] - Retrieves the length of the string referenced by [.rhs/#].
 * // 5. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * // 6. [set-value:x:@.result] - Sets the value of [.result] to -1 if the condition is true.
