/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda script, which is a common structure for passing parameters or data into a script or function.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. In this context, it will return all the children of the `.arguments` node. This is useful for accessing all the parameters or data passed into the script.
 * 
 * 3. `strength`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `strength`. It is used to specifically access the node that contains the value or data related to "strength" within the arguments. This is useful when you want to extract or manipulate a specific piece of data from a larger set of parameters.
