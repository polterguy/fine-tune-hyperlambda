/*
 * 1. `@data.connect`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "data.connect" from the current context. It is useful for accessing specific nodes by name when you know the exact name of the node you want to interact with.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected "data.connect" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing you to work with multiple child nodes simultaneously.
 * 
 * 3. `data.select`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved set of nodes to only include those named "data.select". It is used to narrow down the node set to specific nodes of interest based on their name, after retrieving a broader set of nodes with the `*` iterator.
