// The [unwrap] slot in this code is used to evaluate and replace expressions within the current node context. It processes expressions before the instruction pointer reaches the node where [unwrap] is referenced. The expression "x:+/*/*" indicates navigating to the elder sibling node, then accessing all its children and their children. This allows the code to dynamically evaluate and update node values or structures based on the specified expression path.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
