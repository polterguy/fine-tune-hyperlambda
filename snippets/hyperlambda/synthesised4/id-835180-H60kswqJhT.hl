// The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to the specified role, in this case, "root". If the user does not belong to the "root" role, an exception is thrown, ensuring that only users with the "root" role can proceed. This slot is typically used within an HTTP endpoint to enforce role-based access control.
