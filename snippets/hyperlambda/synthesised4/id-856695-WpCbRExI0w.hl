// The code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes to a specific location in a Hyperlambda structure. It uses the [add] slot to insert nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot. The [get-nodes] slot fetches nodes from a specified path, which in this case is the [.arguments] node within the [hyper2lambda] node. The [add] slot then adds these nodes to the path specified by its expression. This operation is useful for dynamically modifying the structure of a Hyperlambda graph by appending nodes from one part of the graph to another.
