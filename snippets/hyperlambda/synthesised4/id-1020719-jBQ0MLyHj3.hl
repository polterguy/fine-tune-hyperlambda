/*
 * 1. `@.data`: This iterator searches for the first node named `.data` from the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards through the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful for accessing a specific section of the data structure that is named `.data`.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the node(s) found by the previous iterator. In this context, it will return all child nodes of the `.data` node. This is useful when you want to process or examine all elements within a particular section of the data.
 * 
 * 3. `item2`: This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to only include nodes named `item2`. It is used to narrow down the selection to specific nodes of interest, in this case, those named `item2` among the children of `.data`.
 * 
 * This expression is useful for navigating a hierarchical data structure to find and work with specific nodes based on their names and positions within the hierarchy.
