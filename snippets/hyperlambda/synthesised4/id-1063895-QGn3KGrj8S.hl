/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is typically used to access the `.arguments` node, which is often used to define input parameters or arguments in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any nodes that are directly under the `.arguments` node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `/databaseType`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `databaseType` among the children of `.arguments`. It is used to specifically target the `databaseType` node, which might contain information about the type of database being used, such as "SQL", "NoSQL", etc. This is useful when you need to perform operations or make decisions based on the type of database specified in the arguments.
