// The [type] slot in Hyperlambda is used to return the type name of a given value. In the provided example, a node named [.foo] is declared with an integer value of 57. The [type] slot is then invoked with an expression pointing to the [.foo] node, and it will return the type of the value, which is "int" in this case. This functionality is useful for dynamically determining the data type of a node's value within a Hyperlambda script.
