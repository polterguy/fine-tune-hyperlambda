/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [switch] slot to perform conditional branching based on the value of a [case] node. It evaluates the value of the [case] node and executes the corresponding lambda block if the value matches. If no case matches, the [default] block is executed. This structure is useful for handling multiple conditions with different outcomes.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Initiates a switch statement to evaluate multiple cases.
 * 2. [case] - Represents a specific condition to match within the switch statement.
 * 3. [default] - Executes if none of the [case] conditions match.
