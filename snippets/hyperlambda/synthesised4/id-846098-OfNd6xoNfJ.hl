// This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of the carriage return character "\r" in the value of the [.greeting] node with the escaped string "\\r". The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the string to be replaced, and the second is the replacement string. The expression [x:@.greeting] is used to specify the target string for replacement.
strings.replace:x:@.greeting
   .:"\r"
   .:"\\r"
