 * 1. The first iterator is [+], which retrieves the next sibling node (the node immediately below the current node at the same indentation level).
 * 2. The second iterator is [*], which retrieves all children of the previously selected node (the next sibling).
 * 3. The third iterator is [*], which retrieves all children of each of the nodes found in the previous step (the children of the next sibling).
 * 
 * The overall effect of this expression is to return all grandchildren (second-level descendants) of the next sibling node of the current node.
