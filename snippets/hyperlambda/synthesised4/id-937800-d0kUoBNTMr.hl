// This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL query to select distinct customer details from the "chinook" database, specifically targeting customers who listen to rock music. It retrieves the email, first name, last name, and genre name by joining multiple tables such as Customer, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, and Genre, and filters the results using a parameterized 'like' condition on the genre name. The results are ordered by the customer's email.
