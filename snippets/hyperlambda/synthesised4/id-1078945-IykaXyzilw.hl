/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It is often used to locate the arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which typically contains input parameters for a function or slot.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument provided to a function or slot.
 * 3. `prefix` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "prefix" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target the "prefix" argument.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a function or slot to access the value of the "prefix" argument provided by the caller, allowing the function to perform operations based on this specific argument.
 * - It can be used in validation logic to ensure that a required "prefix" argument is present before proceeding with further processing.
