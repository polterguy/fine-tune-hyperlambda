// The code snippet demonstrates the use of an [else] block to execute a slot named [magic.auth.captcha-verify]. This slot is invoked with a token argument, which is dynamically retrieved from the [recaptcha_response] node within the [.arguments] node. The [else] block is typically used to define actions when previous [if] or [else-if] conditions are not met.
