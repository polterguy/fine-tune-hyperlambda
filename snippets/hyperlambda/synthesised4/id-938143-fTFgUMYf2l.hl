// This Hyperlambda code checks if either the value of [numA] is less than 7 or the value of [numB] is more than 11. If either condition is true, it sets the value of [output] to true. The [or] slot allows for multiple conditions, and the [if] slot executes the [.lambda] block if any condition is met.
