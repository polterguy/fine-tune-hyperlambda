/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds the node. This is useful for accessing the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "arguments" node. It does not filter by name or value, so it will return every direct child node under "arguments". This is useful for accessing all parameters or settings that have been passed as arguments.
 * 
 * 3. `stream` - This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to only include nodes named "stream". It is used to specifically target a node with the name "stream" among the children of the "arguments" node, which could represent a data stream or a similar concept in the context of the code.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where a function or slot needs to process or manipulate a data stream passed as an argument. By isolating the "stream" node, the code can directly interact with or modify the stream data as needed.
 * - It could also be useful in a logging or monitoring context, where the presence or value of a "stream" argument needs to be checked or recorded.
