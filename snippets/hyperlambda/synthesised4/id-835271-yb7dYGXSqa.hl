// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database and performs a series of operations to manage user data. It first deletes any existing user record with a matching username, then creates a new user in the "users" table with specified username and password. Additional user information such as email and name is inserted into the "users_extra" table. Finally, it iterates over roles obtained from an authentication ticket, creating entries in the "users_roles" table for each role associated with the user.
