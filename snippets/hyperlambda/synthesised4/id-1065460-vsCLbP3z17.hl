/*
 * 1. `@data.select`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "data.select" in the current context. It starts the expression by locating this specific node, which is expected to be a direct child of the root or current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.select" node. It expands the search to include every child node under "data.select", regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: This iterator further retrieves all children nodes of each node found in the previous step. It dives one level deeper into the hierarchy, accessing all grandchildren of the "data.select" node.
 * 
 * 4. `keyword_density`: This iterator filters the results to include only nodes named "keyword_density". It narrows down the selection to nodes with this specific name among the grandchildren of "data.select". 
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is useful for navigating a structured data set where you need to find and process all "keyword_density" nodes that are nested within a specific "data.select" node, potentially for tasks like analyzing keyword density metrics in a document or dataset.
