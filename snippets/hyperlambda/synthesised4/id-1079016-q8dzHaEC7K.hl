/*
 * 1. `@.exe` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "exe" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy to find the "exe" node. This is useful when you need to access a node that is higher up in the hierarchy, such as a configuration or control node that influences the current context.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "exe" node. It is used to access all nodes directly under the "exe" node, which could represent various components or attributes related to the execution context.
 * 
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "signal" from the previously retrieved children. It is used to specifically target nodes that represent signals or messages within the execution context, which might be used for triggering events or handling specific actions.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to process or respond to signals within a larger execution context, such as handling events in a workflow or monitoring system.
 * - It might also be used to log or audit signals for debugging or analysis purposes, ensuring that all relevant signals are captured and processed accordingly.
