/*
 * The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specified node set. It retrieves the file data nodes using an expression and adds two new nodes: [prompt] and [completion]. Each of these nodes is assigned a dynamic expression that constructs a path to extract text content from specific nodes within the file data. The expressions use lambda expressions to reference nodes based on arguments passed into the code, allowing for dynamic content retrieval and node creation.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends new nodes to the node set specified by the expression.
 * 2. [.] - Creates a container node for the new nodes to be added.
 * 3. [prompt] - A node that uses a dynamic expression to construct a path for extracting text content based on the "prompt" argument.
 * 4. [completion] - A node that uses a dynamic expression to construct a path for extracting text content based on the "completion" argument.
