/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.dp] in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is known to be in the current hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the [.dp] node is another node, and it allows you to access this node by reference. This is particularly useful when the value of a node is a complex object or another node structure that you need to manipulate or query further.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous step. It is used to access the entire set of child nodes, which can then be filtered or processed as needed. This is useful in scenarios where you need to iterate over or examine all elements within a parent node.
 * 
 * 4. `price` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "price". It is used to narrow down the set of nodes to those that are specifically named "price", which is helpful when you are interested in extracting or processing pricing information from a larger data structure.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include retrieving and processing price information from a collection of data nodes, such as calculating the total cost of items in a shopping cart or updating pricing details in a product catalog.
