// This Hyperlambda code throws an exception with the message "You are not supposed to be here!". The [throw] slot is used to raise an error, which can be caught and handled by a [.catch] block if present. If unhandled, the exception will propagate up the call stack, potentially terminating the execution of the current lambda object.
throw:You are not supposed to be here!
