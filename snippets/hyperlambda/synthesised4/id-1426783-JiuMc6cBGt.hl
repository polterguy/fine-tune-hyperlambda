// This Hyperlambda code sends a SignalR message to all subscribers of the session specified by the expression [x:@.session]. The message includes an argument indicating that a task or process has been completed, with the [finished] node set to a boolean value of true. This allows connected clients to receive real-time updates about the completion status of a session-related task. The [args] node is used to pass additional data in JSON format to the subscribers.
