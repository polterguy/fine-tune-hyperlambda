// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of nodes found at a specific path to a concatenated string. It uses [set-name] to rename nodes under the [columns] node with a name of [distinct_functor]. The new name is created by concatenating the string "count(distinct ", the value of [distinct_column] from [arguments], and a closing parenthesis using [strings.concat]. This effectively constructs a SQL-like distinct count function name dynamically.
