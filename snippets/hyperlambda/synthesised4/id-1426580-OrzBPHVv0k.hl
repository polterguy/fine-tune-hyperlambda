/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if there are any tasks listed using the [tasks.list] slot. If tasks exist, it executes a lambda that deletes a specific task with the ID "sqlite.create-backup" using the [tasks.delete] slot. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks a condition to determine if the subsequent code block should be executed.
 * 2. [exists] - Evaluates whether there are any tasks listed by [tasks.list].
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the code block to execute if the condition is true.
 * 4. [tasks.delete] - Deletes the task with the ID "sqlite.create-backup".
