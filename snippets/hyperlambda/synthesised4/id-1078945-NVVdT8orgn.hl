/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator searches for the first node named "session" that is an ancestor of the current node. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors up in the hierarchy. This is useful for accessing session-related data or configurations that are stored in a higher-level node within the current execution context. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving session information such as user credentials or session-specific settings in a web application.
 * - Accessing global configuration or state information that is stored in a session node higher up in the hierarchy.
