/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it will search for this node starting from the current node and moving upwards through its siblings and ancestors until it finds a match. This is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate data associated with a specific node named "sql" in your Hyperlambda graph. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a SQL query or command stored in a node named "sql" for execution or further processing.
 * - Accessing configuration or connection details related to SQL operations that are stored in a node named "sql".
