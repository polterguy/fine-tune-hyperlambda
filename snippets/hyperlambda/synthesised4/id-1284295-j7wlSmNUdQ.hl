// The expression `unwrap:x:+/*` is used to evaluate and retrieve all child nodes of the current node's elder sibling. The `+` iterator specifies the elder sibling of the current node, and the `/*` iterator retrieves all children of that elder sibling. The `unwrap` slot ensures that the expression is evaluated before the node is processed, allowing for dynamic retrieval of node sets. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically access and process a collection of nodes that are structured as children of a sibling node, such as when aggregating data or applying transformations to a related set of nodes.
