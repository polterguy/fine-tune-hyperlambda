// The code compares the value retrieved from the [signal] node's [total] child with the value obtained from the [get-count] node, returning true if the former is greater than the latter. [mt] performs the comparison, [get-value:x:@signal/*/total] retrieves the total value, and [get-value:x:@get-count] retrieves the count value.
