/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [system_message] exists within the [.arguments] node, ensuring it is not null and not equal to an empty string. If both conditions are met, the [and] slot evaluates to true. The code is useful for validating that a required argument is both present and has a meaningful value. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Combines multiple conditions and evaluates to true only if all conditions are true.
 * 2. [not-null] - Checks if the [system_message] node exists and has a non-null value.
 * 3. [neq] - Verifies that the [system_message] node's value is not equal to an empty string.
