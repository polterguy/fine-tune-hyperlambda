// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda, which executes its child nodes if none of the preceding conditional siblings are true. In this example, it uses the [add] slot to append nodes to the [tasks.schedule] node, specifically adding nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot from the [.arguments] node with the name [due]. This is executed only if the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are not met.
else
   add:x:../*/tasks.schedule
      get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/due
