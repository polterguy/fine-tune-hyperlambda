/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the hierarchy from the current node.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children of the parent node obtained from the previous step.
 * 3. `.result` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `.result` from the children nodes retrieved in the previous step.
 * 4. `**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the current result set, including the node itself, using a "breadth-first" algorithm. It will traverse all levels of the hierarchy under each `.result` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to gather all descendant nodes under nodes named `.result` starting from the parent node of the current context. It is useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze all data related to a specific result within a larger hierarchical structure.
