// This Hyperlambda code uses the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions: [not-null] checks if the node [.new-prompt] has a non-null value, and [neq] verifies that the value of [.new-prompt] is not an empty string. The [and] slot returns true only if both conditions are true, ensuring that [.new-prompt] is neither null nor an empty string.
