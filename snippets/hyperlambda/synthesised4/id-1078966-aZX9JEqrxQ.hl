/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` within the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which holds the parameters passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each individual argument passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `summarize` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name `summarize`. It is used to specifically target the `summarize` argument within the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to access and manipulate the `summarize` argument passed to it. For example, it might be used to retrieve a summary of data or to perform operations based on the summary provided.
