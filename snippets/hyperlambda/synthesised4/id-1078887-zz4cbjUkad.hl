/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named [.dp] in the current context. This is typically used in loops or dynamic slots where [.dp] represents the current node being processed.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the [.dp] node, assuming its value is a node itself. This allows direct access to the node referenced by [.dp].
 * 
 * 3. `.` - This retrieves the parent node of the current node, effectively moving one level up in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 4. `.` - Another parent retrieval, moving further up one more level in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 5. `**` - This retrieves all descendant nodes of the current node, including the node itself, using a breadth-first search algorithm. This is useful for traversing entire subtrees.
 * 
 * 6. `a` - Filters the result set to include only nodes named "a" from the descendants retrieved in the previous step.
 * 
 * 7. `*` - Retrieves all children of the nodes named "a". This is useful for accessing nested structures within the "a" nodes.
 * 
 * 8. `\@class` - Finds the first node named "class" among the children of the "a" nodes. The backslash is used to escape the "@" character, which is typically a special character in expressions.
 * 
 * 9. `=result__snippet` - Filters the nodes to include only those with a value of "result__snippet". This is a value comparison, ensuring only nodes with this specific value are included.
 * 
 * 10. `.` - Retrieves the parent node of the current node, moving one level up in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 11. `**` - Again retrieves all descendant nodes of the current node, including itself, using a breadth-first search.
 * 
 * 12. `\#text` - Finds the first node named "#text" among the descendants. The backslash is used to escape the "#" character, which is typically a special character in expressions.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a web scraping context where the goal is to extract specific text content from HTML structures, particularly focusing on nodes with a class attribute of "result__snippet".
 * - It could also be used in data processing tasks where extracting and filtering specific text nodes from a complex data structure is required.
