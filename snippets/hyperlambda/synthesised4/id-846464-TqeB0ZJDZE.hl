// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] slot to specify a condition for joining tables in a SQL query. It establishes a relationship between the "ReportsTo" column in the "Employees" table and the "EmployeeID" column in the "ReportsTo" table, ensuring that the join condition is met when these columns have matching values. This is typically used in constructing SQL queries to retrieve data from related tables based on specific conditions.
