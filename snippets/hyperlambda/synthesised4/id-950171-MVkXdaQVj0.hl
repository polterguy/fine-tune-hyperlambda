// This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the value of the [.full-path] node by concatenating a static string "/data/" with the value retrieved from the [name] node inside the [file] node, which is a child of the [.arguments] node. It uses [strings.concat] to perform the concatenation and [get-value] to access the [name] node's value.
