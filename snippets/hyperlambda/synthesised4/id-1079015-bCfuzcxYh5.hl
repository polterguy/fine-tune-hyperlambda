// 1. `@.auth` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "auth" within the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, looking for a node named "auth". This is useful when you need to access authentication-related information or settings that are defined in a parent node or a configuration node higher up in the hierarchy. A potential use case could be retrieving authentication credentials or tokens that are stored in a parent node for use in subsequent operations or validations.
