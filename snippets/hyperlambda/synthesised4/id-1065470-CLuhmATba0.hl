 * 1. `@data.select` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "data.select" from the current context. It is useful when you want to access a specific node by name within the current node hierarchy.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node returned by the previous iterator. It is useful for accessing all direct descendants of a specific node, allowing you to perform operations on each child node.
