// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" that is an ancestor of the current node in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors up in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to reference a specific node that is higher up in the structure, ensuring that you are accessing the correct node without interference from sibling nodes. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios where you have nested structures and need to ensure that you are referencing a node that is part of the current execution context, rather than a sibling or unrelated node.
