/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves to the next node below the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you need to access a node that is at the same level but appears after the current node in the sequence.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it is used to access all children of the elder sibling node retrieved by the `+` iterator. This is useful for iterating over all child nodes of a specific sibling node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes retrieved by the previous `*` iterator. This allows for accessing deeper levels of the node hierarchy, specifically the grandchildren of the elder sibling node.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - The third `*` iterator again retrieves all children nodes of the nodes retrieved by the previous `*` iterator. This further deepens the traversal into the node hierarchy, accessing great-grandchildren nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `content` - This iterator filters out any nodes that do not have the name "content" from the previous result set. It is used to specifically target nodes named "content" at the great-grandchildren level of the elder sibling node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to navigate a complex node structure where you need to access a specific piece of data (the "content" node) that is nested several levels deep within a sibling node. 
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where data is organized hierarchically, and you need to extract specific information from a related node that is not directly connected to the current context.
