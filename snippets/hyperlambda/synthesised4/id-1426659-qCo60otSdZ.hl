 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [neq] slot to check if the value of a specific node is not equal to a given value. The expression in the [neq] slot points to a node using a complex lambda expression, and it compares this node's value to another value specified as a child node of [neq]. If the values are not equal, the [neq] slot evaluates to true.
 * // 1. [neq] - Checks if two values are not equal.
 * // 2. Expression: "@.dp/#/*/\@src/[0,1]" - Points to a specific node in the graph structure to retrieve its value for comparison.
 * // 3. [.] - Represents the value to compare against.
