/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is another node itself, allowing you to work with the original node rather than a copy.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It allows you to access the children of the node that was de-referenced in the previous step.
 * 
 * 4. `\#text` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "#text". It is used to specifically target nodes that are named "#text" among the children retrieved in the previous step.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to extract text content from a node structure where text nodes are specifically named "#text". For example, it might be useful in a scenario where you are processing XML-like data and need to extract text content from specific elements.
 * - It could also be used in a data transformation task where you need to manipulate or analyze text nodes within a larger data structure.
