/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any nodes that are direct children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `headers` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `headers`. It is used to specifically access the `headers` node among the children of the `.arguments` node. This is useful in scenarios where you need to process or manipulate HTTP headers passed as arguments.
