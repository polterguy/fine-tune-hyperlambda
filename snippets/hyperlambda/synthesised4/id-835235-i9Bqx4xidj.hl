// The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to the "root" role. If the user does not have this role, the slot will throw an exception, effectively preventing unauthorized access. This is typically used in contexts where only users with specific roles should be allowed to proceed, such as securing HTTP endpoints.
