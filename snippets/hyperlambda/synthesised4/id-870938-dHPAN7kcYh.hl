// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to transform a Hyperlambda text into a lambda hierarchy and then add it to an existing node structure. It uses the [hyper2lambda] slot to parse the text while preserving comments, and the [add] slot to append the resulting lambda object. The [set-value] slot is used to update the value of the node being processed.
