/*
 * 1. `@.scan`: This iterator looks for the first node named "scan" at the current level or upwards in the hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards until it finds a node with the name "scan". This is useful for referencing a specific node in a nested structure without needing to know its exact position.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "scan" node found by the previous iterator. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "scan" node, allowing operations or evaluations on each of these child nodes.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used to iterate over all child nodes of a "scan" node, which might represent a collection of items or data points that need to be processed or evaluated.
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you need to apply a certain operation or check a condition on all elements within a specific section of a data structure, such as scanning through a list of files or records.
