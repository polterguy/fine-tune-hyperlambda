// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to construct a SQL query using the [data.read] slot to read data from a SQLite database. It specifies a [table] named "opportunities" and performs a left [join] with the "clients" table, aliasing it as "client_id". The query retrieves [columns] using an [aggregate_functor] and aliases the result as "result". It includes a [where] clause with a logical [and] condition and groups the results by a [group_column]. This setup allows for complex SQL queries with joins, aggregations, and groupings.
