/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [as] node within the [columns] node of a [data.read] operation to the value retrieved from the [aggregate_function] argument. It uses the [set-value] slot to modify the node's value and the [get-value] slot to obtain the value of the specified argument. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 3. [@data.connect/*/data.read/*/columns/1/*/as] - The expression pointing to the target node whose value will be set.
 * 4. [@.arguments/*/aggregate_function] - The expression pointing to the source node whose value will be retrieved.
