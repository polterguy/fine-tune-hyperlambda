// This Hyperlambda code checks if the result of a [data.scalar] operation is equal to 0. If the condition is true, it throws an exception with a message indicating that a function doesn't exist on a type, and sets the HTTP response status to 400. The [throw] slot is used to raise an exception, and it includes additional information such as a public flag and a status code.
