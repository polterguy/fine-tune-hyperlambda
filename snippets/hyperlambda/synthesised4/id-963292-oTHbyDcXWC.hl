/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses an [if] statement combined with an [or] condition to evaluate whether either a static boolean value is false or the value retrieved from a node pointed by [.value] is true. If either condition is true, it executes a lambda that sets the value of a sibling node [.result] to "OK". The [or] slot short-circuits, meaning it stops evaluating further if one condition is true. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Evaluates the condition and executes its lambda if true.
 * 2. [or] - Logical OR, evaluates to true if any child condition is true.
 * 3. [.:bool:false] - Static boolean condition, always false.
 * 4. [get-value:x:@.value] - Retrieves the value of the node [.value].
 * 5. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the [if] condition is true.
 * 6. [set-value:x:../*/.result] - Sets the value of [.result] to "OK".
