// This code iterates over each child node of [.data] using [for-each], and for each node, it replaces occurrences of a string specified in the [what] node with another string specified in the [with] node. The result of this replacement operation is then set as the value of the [.result] node. The [strings.replace] slot is used to perform the string replacement, and [get-value] retrieves the values of the [what] and [with] nodes for each iteration.
