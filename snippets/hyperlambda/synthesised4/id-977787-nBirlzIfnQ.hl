// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to delete records from a database table named "records" using the [data.delete] slot. It specifies a [where] condition to ensure that only records with an ID matching the provided [recordId] argument are deleted. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple conditions, though in this case, only one condition is present, checking for equality with [id.eq].
data.delete
   table:records
   where
      and
         id.eq:x:@.arguments/*/recordId
