/*
 * 1. `@data.read`: This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context with the name "data.read". It is used to locate the starting point for further traversal within the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node(s). In this context, it retrieves all children of the "data.read" node.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: This is another `*` iterator that retrieves all children nodes of each node returned by the previous `*` iterator. It allows for deeper traversal into the node hierarchy.
 * 
 * 4. `count`: This iterator filters the results to only include nodes with the name "count" from the previously retrieved set of nodes. It is used to specifically target nodes named "count" within the structure.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to find and process all "count" nodes within a specific data structure that starts from a "data.read" node. 
 * - It might be used in scenarios where you need to calculate or aggregate data based on the "count" values within a nested data structure.
