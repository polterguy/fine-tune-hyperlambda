// This code snippet uses the [else] slot to execute a block of code when all preceding [if] and [else-if] conditions evaluate to false. It sets the value of the [.new-prompt] node by concatenating several strings, including a message indicating the success of a workflow invocation, and appends two newline characters for formatting. The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine the strings and values retrieved from other nodes.
