// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to update records in a SQLite database table named "Doctors" using the [data.update] slot. The [database-type] is specified as "sqlite" to indicate the database system in use. The [table] slot specifies the table to update, while the [values] slot is intended to contain the columns and their new values. The [where] slot, with a nested [and] condition, is used to specify the criteria for selecting which records to update. This ensures that only records meeting the specified conditions are updated, preventing unintended modifications to all records in the table.
