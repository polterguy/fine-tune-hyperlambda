/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by searching for the first node named `.arguments` from the current node's context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which is often used to pass parameters or data into a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any node directly under the `.arguments` node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `/url` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `url` from the previous result set. It is used to specifically target the `url` node among the children of the `.arguments` node. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate the value of the `url` argument passed into a function or endpoint.
