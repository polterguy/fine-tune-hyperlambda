// The [endpoints.list] slot retrieves meta information about all HTTP endpoints in the system. It semantically traverses and loads all Hyperlambda files that resolve to valid URLs, returning details such as HTTP verb, URL, arguments, and descriptions. This allows users to view and manage endpoint metadata efficiently, similar to how Swagger operates, within the Magic dashboard.
