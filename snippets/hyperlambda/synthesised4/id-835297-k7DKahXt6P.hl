// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [Key] node within the current node referenced by [.dp] is equal to "PRI". If the condition is true, it adds a new node with the name [primary] and a boolean value of true to the [.tmp] node. The [if] slot evaluates the condition, and the [.lambda] slot contains the actions to execute if the condition is met. The [add] slot appends the new node to the specified location.
