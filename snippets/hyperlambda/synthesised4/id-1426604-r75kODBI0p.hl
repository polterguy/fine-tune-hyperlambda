/*
 * This code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot in Hyperlambda to determine the type of a node's value. The [type] slot returns the Hyperlambda type name of the value it is applied to. In this example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer type and a value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to retrieve the type of the value of the node directly above it, which is [.foo]. After invoking the [type] slot, it will return "int" as the type of the value of [.foo].
 * 
 * 1. [.foo:int:57] - Declares a node named [.foo] with an integer type and a value of 57.
 * 2. [type:x:-] - Uses the [type] slot to retrieve the type of the value of the node directly above it, which is [.foo].
