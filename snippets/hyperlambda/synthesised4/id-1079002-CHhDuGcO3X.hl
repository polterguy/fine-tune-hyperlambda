/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This node is typically used in loops like [for-each] to reference the current node being iterated over.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the node is itself a node, allowing you to access and manipulate the original node rather than a copy. This is useful when you want to perform operations directly on the node's value.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node found by the previous iterator. It is used to access the children of the node that was de-referenced in the previous step.
 * 
 * 4. `column_name` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "column_name" among the children retrieved by the previous `*` iterator. It effectively narrows down the selection to nodes named "column_name".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a database-like context where you are iterating over rows of data, and you want to access or manipulate the "column_name" field of each row.
 * - It could also be used in a data transformation or processing task where you need to extract specific fields from a structured data set for further operations.
