// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.delete] slot to remove records from a specified table in a SQLite database. The [database-type] specifies the database system, while the [table] indicates the target table for deletion. The [where] clause, combined with [and], allows for specifying conditions that records must meet to be deleted, ensuring precise control over which records are affected.
