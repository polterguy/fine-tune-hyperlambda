// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "sql" that is located in the current context or hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` symbol specifies that it starts the search from the current node's context. This is useful for accessing specific nodes directly by their name when you need to perform operations or retrieve values from them.
