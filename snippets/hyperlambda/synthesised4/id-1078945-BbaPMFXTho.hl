/*
 * 1. `@.session` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" that is located in the current context or hierarchy. It uses the "@" symbol to indicate that it should look for a node with the specified name. This is useful in scenarios where you need to access session-related data or configurations stored within a node named "session". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing user session information in a web application to retrieve user-specific data or settings.
 * - Retrieving session state or variables in a server-side application to maintain continuity between different parts of a process.
