// The code snippet creates a signal named [magic.crypto.http.has-invoked] and assigns it a [request-id] by retrieving the value from the [.request-id] node. This setup is typically used to track or log HTTP request invocations, ensuring that each request can be uniquely identified and processed accordingly. The [request-id] acts as a unique identifier for the HTTP request, allowing for better traceability and debugging.
