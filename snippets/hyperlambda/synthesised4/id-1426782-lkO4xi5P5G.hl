// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [get-count] slot to count the number of child nodes within the [content] node, which is a child of an [http.get] node. The expression `@http.get/*/content/*` navigates through the node structure to locate the [content] node and counts its children, returning the total number of these nodes.
get-count:x:@http.get/*/content/*
