// The [context] slot in Hyperlambda is used to add an object to the stack, allowing it to be retrieved later using the [get-context] slot. This is useful for maintaining data accessibility throughout the execution of a Hyperlambda snippet, without passing data as arguments to slots. The slot requires a name as its value, a [value] node for the stack object, and a [.lambda] node where the stack object exists.
