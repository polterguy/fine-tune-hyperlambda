/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the HTTP status code returned from an [http.get] request is less than 300. If the status code is less than 300, the [lt] slot will return true, indicating a successful HTTP request (typically, status codes below 300 indicate success in HTTP communication). 
 * 
 * 1. [lt] - Compares its two arguments and returns true if the first argument is less than the second.
 * 2. [x:@http.get] - Retrieves the result of the [http.get] request, specifically the status code.
 * 3. [.:int:300] - Represents the integer value 300, which is used as the threshold for comparison.
