// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and "unwrap" all expressions within the node structure, effectively resolving any references or expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions inside a lambda object, ensuring that all expressions are evaluated before execution. The expression "x:+/*/*" specifies the nodes to be unwrapped.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
