// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [data.create] slot to insert a new record into the "users_extra" table. It specifies the table name with [table] and provides the [values] slot to define the columns and their respective values. The [user] field is set using a lambda expression referencing the [.username] node, while the [type] field is assigned a static value "name". The [value] field is set using a lambda expression referencing the [.name] node.
