/*
 * 1. `@data.read` - This iterator searches for the first node named "data.read" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node within the hierarchy that serves as the starting point for further navigation.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.read" node. It allows the expression to access all direct descendants of the "data.read" node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of each node returned by the previous `*` iterator. This effectively navigates two levels down from the "data.read" node, capturing all nodes that are two levels deep.
 * 
 * 4. `model` - This iterator filters the nodes obtained from the previous step to only include those named "model". It ensures that only nodes with the name "model" are selected from the two-level deep descendants of the "data.read" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract all "model" nodes that are two levels deep within a "data.read" node. It could be useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze specific data models retrieved from a data source or configuration file.
 * - It might be used in a data processing pipeline to selectively apply operations or transformations to specific models within a larger dataset.
