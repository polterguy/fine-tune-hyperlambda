/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code checks if a specific node exists within a graph structure and performs operations based on that condition. It uses the [if] slot to evaluate whether a node with the name [_type] and the value [string] exists within the [hyper2lambda] node's [.arguments] children. If the condition is true, it executes the [.lambda] block, which unravels the children nodes and adds a new node with the name [execute-file] to the parent node, setting its [_type] value based on the [type] node within [.arguments].
 * // 1. [if] - Evaluates a condition to determine if a specific node exists.
 * // 2. [exists] - Checks for the existence of a node with a specific name and value.
 * // 3. [.lambda] - Contains the operations to execute if the condition is true.
 * // 4. [unwrap] - Unwraps and evaluates the children nodes.
 * // 5. [add] - Adds a new node to the parent node with a specific name and value.
