// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [neq] slot to compare two values. The first value is retrieved from a complex expression pointing to a specific node, and the second value is expected to be provided as a static value. The [neq] slot will evaluate to true if these two values are not equal. The expression uses iterators to navigate the node structure, including [@] for node name matching, [#] for value retrieval, [*] for all children, and [0,1] for selecting a subset of nodes.
