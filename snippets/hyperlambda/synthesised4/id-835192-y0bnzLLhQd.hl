// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is used with the "+" iterator to evaluate and transform the value of the subsequent node, ensuring that the [dest] node will have the evaluated value of the [src] node, which is "Hello World". This slot is particularly useful when invoking lambda objects with expressions, as it allows expressions to be evaluated before the lambda object is executed.
