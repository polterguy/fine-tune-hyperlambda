/*
 * 1. `@signal` - Finds the first ancestor or sibling node named [signal] before the current node in the hierarchy.
 * 2. `*` - Retrieves all children of the [signal] node.
 * 3. `*` - Retrieves all children of each child node found in the previous step.
 * 4. `db` - Filters out all nodes not named [db] from the previous result set.
 * 5. `=performance_schema` - Filters the [db] nodes to only those whose value is exactly "performance_schema".
 * 
 * This expression finds the first [signal] node upwards or before the current node, then searches two levels down through its children and grandchildren, selects all [db] nodes at that level, and finally returns only those [db] nodes whose value is "performance_schema".
