/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument node individually.
 * 
 * 3. `disallow` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `disallow`. It is used to specifically target nodes that have this name, possibly indicating a list or collection of items that are not allowed.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of each `disallow` node. It is used to access the specific items or elements that are being disallowed.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a validation context where you want to check if certain items are not allowed based on the arguments provided to a function or slot.
 * - It could be useful in a security context to enforce restrictions or permissions by specifying which actions or resources are disallowed.
