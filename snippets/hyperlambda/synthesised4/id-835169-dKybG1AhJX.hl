// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of all nodes referenced by the expression [./*/execute] to the value retrieved by the [get-value] slot. The [get-value] slot fetches the value of the node currently iterated by reference, as indicated by [@.dp/#]. This is useful for dynamically updating node values within a loop or similar construct.
