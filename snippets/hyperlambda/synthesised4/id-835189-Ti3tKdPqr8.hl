 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds nodes to a specified location by using the [add] slot. It retrieves nodes from an HTML structure, specifically targeting the children of the [main] node within the [body] of an HTML document, and adds these nodes to the destination specified by the [add] slot's expression. The [get-nodes] slot is used to fetch the nodes to be added. 
 *
