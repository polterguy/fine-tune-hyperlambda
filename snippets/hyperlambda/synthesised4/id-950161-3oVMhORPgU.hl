// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a subtraction operation using the [math.subtraction] signal. It takes two integer arguments, [arg1] and [arg2], and subtracts the value of [arg2] from [arg1]. The result of this operation is not explicitly shown but would typically be used or stored in subsequent operations.
signal:math.subtraction
   arg1:int:10
   arg2:int:4
