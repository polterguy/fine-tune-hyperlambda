/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator searches for the first node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy. In this expression, it looks for the first node named "title" in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve the value of a "title" node that is located somewhere above the current node in the hierarchy. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to access a document or section title that is defined at a higher level in the structure.
