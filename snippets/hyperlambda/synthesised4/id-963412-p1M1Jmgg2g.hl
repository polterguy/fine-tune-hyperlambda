// The code deletes records from the "sessions" table where the "expires_at" field is less than the current date and time. It uses the [pgsql.delete] slot to specify the table and the [where] clause to define the condition, leveraging the [lt] slot to compare the "expires_at" field with the current date obtained from [date.now].
