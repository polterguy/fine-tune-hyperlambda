// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds the first element of a split string to a result node. It uses the [add] slot to perform the addition, where the value being added is the first element (index 0) from the result of a [strings.split] operation. The [strings.split] operation is assumed to have been executed earlier in the code, and its result is accessed using a lambda expression.
