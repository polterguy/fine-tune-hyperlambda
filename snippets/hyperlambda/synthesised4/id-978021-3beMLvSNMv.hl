// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a database table named "subscribers" using the [data.read] slot. The [data.read] slot is used to construct and execute a SQL SELECT query, retrieving records from the specified table. The default behavior limits the result set to 25 records unless overridden by additional arguments such as [limit]. The code does not specify any additional parameters, so it will return all columns from the "subscribers" table with the default limit applied.
data.read
   table:subscribers
