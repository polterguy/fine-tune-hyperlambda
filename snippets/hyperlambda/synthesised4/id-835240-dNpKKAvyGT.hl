// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to update the value of a node specified by its expression [@.dp/#/*/prompt] with the result obtained from the [get-value] slot. The [get-value] slot retrieves data from the node path [@http.post/*/content/*/choices/0/*/message/*/content], essentially extracting a specific piece of content from an HTTP POST response and assigning it to the target node.
set-value:x:@.dp/#/*/prompt
