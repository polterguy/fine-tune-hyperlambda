// This Hyperlambda code uses logical conditions to evaluate if a user's email is verified and if either the type is 'name' or 'email'. The [and] slot ensures both conditions must be true for the overall evaluation to be true, while the [or] slot allows for either type condition to be true. The [user.eq] and [type.eq] slots perform equality checks on their respective values.
