/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` within the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `direction` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `direction` among the children of `.arguments`. It is used to specifically access the `direction` argument passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * This expression is typically used to access the value of a specific argument named `direction` that has been passed to a Hyperlambda slot or function. This is useful in scenarios where you need to perform operations based on the value of the `direction` argument, such as conditional branching or directional logic in your Hyperlambda code.
