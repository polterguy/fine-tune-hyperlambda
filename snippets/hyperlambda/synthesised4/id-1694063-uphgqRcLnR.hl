 * 1. `@strings.concat` - Finds the first ancestor node named [strings.concat] before the current node in the hierarchy.
 * 2. `@strings.concat` - From the node found in the previous step, finds its first ancestor node named [strings.concat] before it in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * This expression traverses upward in the node hierarchy, finding the first [strings.concat] ancestor, then continues upward to find the next [strings.concat] ancestor above that one. The result is the second closest [strings.concat] ancestor node above the current node.
