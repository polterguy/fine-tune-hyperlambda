// // This Hyperlambda code pauses the execution of the current thread for 100 milliseconds. The [sleep] slot is used to introduce a delay, allowing the thread to be temporarily inactive without consuming CPU resources. This can be useful in scenarios where a short wait is required before proceeding with the next operation. The sleep duration is specified in milliseconds as the value of the [sleep] slot.
