// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node it references is reached, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, [unwrap] is used to evaluate the expression "+", which refers to the next sibling node. This ensures that the value of the referenced node is resolved before it is accessed, facilitating dynamic expression evaluation in Hyperlambda.
