// The [case] slot is used to define a case within a [switch] statement, allowing for conditional branching based on the value of a variable. Here, the [case] slot is used with a "tinyint" value, which is a small integer type. This allows for efficient branching based on small integer values, typically used when the range of possible values is limited and known.
