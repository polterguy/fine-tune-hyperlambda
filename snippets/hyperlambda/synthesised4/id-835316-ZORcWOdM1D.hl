// This Hyperlambda code uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a signal to a session identified by [x:@.session]. It includes an [args] node that transmits a JSON object with a key-value pair where "finished" is set to a boolean value of true. This structure is typically used to notify subscribers that a certain session-related task has been completed.
