/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [set-value] slot to modify the value of nodes referenced by its expression. It utilizes [strings.concat] to concatenate the current value of the node obtained via [get-value] with the string " END". The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node pointed to by the expression, which is then appended with " END" before being set back as the node's new value. This operation effectively appends " END" to the existing value of the specified node.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Modifies the value of nodes referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates strings, in this case appending " END" to the node's value.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the current value of the node specified by the expression.
 * 4. [@.completion] - Expression pointing to the node whose value is to be modified.
 * 5. [.dp/#/*/completion] - Expression used within [get-value] to locate the node's current value.
