 * // This Hyperlambda code converts a lambda object into an HTML string. It uses the [lambda2html] slot to transform the lambda object referenced by the expression in its value, which is the [.dp] node's value, into an HTML format. The [.dp] node is typically used in iteration contexts, where it holds the currently iterated node by reference, allowing the conversion of that specific node into HTML.
 * // 1. [lambda2html] - Converts the lambda object referenced by the expression into an HTML string.
 * // 2. [x:@.dp/#] - An expression pointing to the value of the [.dp] node, which is the lambda object to be converted.
