// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a block of code when none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are met. In this case, it sets the value of the [.password] node by hashing the password provided in the [.arguments] node using the [crypto.password.hash] slot. The [set-value] slot assigns the hashed password to the [.password] node.
