/*
 * This Hyperlambda code evaluates a logical condition using [and], [or], [not], [exists], and [get-value] slots. It checks if either the [semantics] argument does not exist or its value is true, and if an [article] node exists within the HTML body structure. The [and] slot ensures both conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Combines multiple conditions and evaluates to true only if all conditions are true.
 * 2. [or] - Evaluates to true if at least one of its conditions is true.
 * 3. [not] - Negates the boolean value of its argument.
 * 4. [exists:x:@.arguments/*/semantics] - Checks if the [semantics] argument exists.
 * 5. [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/semantics] - Retrieves the value of the [semantics] argument.
 * 6. [exists:x:@html2lambda/*/html/*/body/**/article] - Checks if an [article] node exists within the HTML body structure.
