// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to create a hashed representation of a password using the Blowfish algorithm. The [crypto.password.hash] slot takes a password as input and generates a secure hash, which can be stored safely in a database to protect against unauthorized access and rainbow table attacks.
