// This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the value of the node referenced by [@.from] to the result of retrieving the value from the second node in the result set of [strings.split]. The [set-value] slot changes the value of a node, while [get-value] retrieves a specific node's value, in this case, the second element from the split operation.
