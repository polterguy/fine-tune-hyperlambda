/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. It's typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda structure, which is often the starting point for accessing parameters passed to a slot or function.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It's used to access any parameter nodes that are direct children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `database` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `database` among the children of the `.arguments` node. This is useful for accessing a specific parameter named `database` that might have been passed as part of the arguments.
