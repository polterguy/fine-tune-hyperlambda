/*
 * 1. `@.body` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named "body" in the current context. This is often used to locate a specific section of a data structure, such as the body of an HTTP request or response.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the "body" node. This is useful for iterating over all elements within the body, regardless of their specific names.
 * 
 * 3. `requestBody` - This filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find those named "requestBody". This is typically used in API specifications to define the structure of the request body.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the "requestBody" node. This allows access to all elements within the requestBody, such as different content types or schemas.
 * 
 * 5. `content` - Filters the children nodes to find those named "content". In API contexts, this often represents the different media types that the request body can have.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the "content" node. This is used to access each media type definition within the content node.
 * 
 * 7. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the previous node, which could be a specific media type. This allows further exploration into the details of each media type.
 * 
 * 8. `schema` - Filters the children nodes to find those named "schema". This is typically where the structure of the data is defined, often using JSON Schema.
 * 
 * 9. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the "schema" node. This is used to access various schema components, such as properties or definitions.
 * 
 * 10. `properties` - Filters the children nodes to find those named "properties". This is where the individual fields of the schema are defined, detailing the expected data structure.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include validating or processing the schema properties of an API request body, such as when generating documentation or performing schema validation.
