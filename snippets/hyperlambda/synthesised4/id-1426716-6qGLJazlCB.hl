// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to insert a node named [_session] as a child to the [execute-file] node. The [_session] node's value is set by evaluating the [session] node within the [.arguments] node, which is located two levels up in the hierarchy. This allows the [execute-file] node to have access to the session information when executing a file.
