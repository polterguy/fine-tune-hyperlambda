// The [throw] slot in Hyperlambda is used to raise an exception with a specified message. By default, the exception is visible only in debug builds, but it can be made public by adding a [public] parameter with a true value, allowing it to propagate to the client. Additional parameters like [status] can modify the HTTP return status code, and [field] can specify which field triggered the exception.
