// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and replace expressions in the node hierarchy. It targets a specific node path using the expression "x:+/*/*/.channel", which navigates to a node named [.channel] within a nested structure. The [unwrap] slot ensures that the expressions are evaluated before the node is processed, allowing for dynamic content manipulation.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/.channel
