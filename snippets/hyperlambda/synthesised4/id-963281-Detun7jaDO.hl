// The code uses the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve all child nodes of each [.src] node located at the same level as the current node. The expression "../*/.src/*" navigates up one level, selects all nodes, filters for nodes named [.src], and then retrieves their children. This allows for accessing and manipulating the children of multiple [.src] nodes simultaneously.
