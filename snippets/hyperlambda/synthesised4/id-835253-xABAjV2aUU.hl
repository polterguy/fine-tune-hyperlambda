 * The code snippet retrieves the value of the [id] node from a specific location within the data structure and assigns it to the [id] node. Specifically, it uses [get-value] to access the [id] node within the first child of [data], and then uses [set-value] to update the [id] node with this retrieved value. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the [id] node.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [id] node from the specified path within the data structure.
