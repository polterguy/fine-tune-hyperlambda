// The code uses the [and] slot to evaluate multiple conditions, ensuring that all conditions must be true for the [and] slot to evaluate to true. It checks if the type of a node, accessed through a lambda expression, is equal to a specified type using the [type.eq] slot. The [type.eq] slot compares the type of a node with a given type, ensuring they match. The lambda expression [x:@.arguments/*/_type] is used to access the type of a node within the arguments.

   type.eq:x:@.arguments/*/_type
