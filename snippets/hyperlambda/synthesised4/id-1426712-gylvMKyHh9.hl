// This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to concatenate a series of strings and set the value of the node referenced by [@.new-prompt] to the resulting string. It combines the current value of [@.new-prompt] with a static message indicating an invocation failure, includes the exception message from [@.arguments/*/message], and appends two new lines at the end. This is useful for logging or displaying detailed error messages in a structured format. The slots used are as follows: [set-value] updates the node's value, [strings.concat] combines the strings, [get-value] retrieves the current value of [@.new-prompt] and the exception message.
set-value:x:@.new-prompt
   strings.concat
      get-value:x:@.new-prompt
      .:"Invocation failed, exception message was: '"
      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/message
      .:"'"
      .:@"
