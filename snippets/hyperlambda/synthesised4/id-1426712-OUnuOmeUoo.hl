/*
 * This Hyperlambda code performs a comparison to check if the value of the node pointed to by the expression [.no-invocation] is greater than 0. If the value is greater, the [mt] slot will return true. The [mt] slot is used for "more than" comparisons, and it requires two arguments: the first being the value to compare, and the second being the threshold value. 
 * 
 * 1. [mt] - Performs a "more than" comparison between its two arguments.
 * 2. [x:@.no-invocation] - Expression pointing to the node whose value is being compared.
 * 3. [.:int:0] - Static integer value used as the threshold for comparison.
