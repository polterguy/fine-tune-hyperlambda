/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are children of the "arguments" node.
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "session" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically access the "session" argument if it exists among the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * This expression is useful when you need to access a specific argument named "session" that is passed into a Hyperlambda slot or function, allowing you to perform operations or checks on the session data.
