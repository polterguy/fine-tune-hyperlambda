/*
 * 1. `@.fixed`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "fixed" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "fixed" node it encounters. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve configuration or constant values stored in a node named "fixed" that might be defined at a higher level in the hierarchy.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to access a node that acts as a global or shared resource within a particular scope.
