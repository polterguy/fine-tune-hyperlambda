/*
 * The given Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [unwrap] and [add] slots to manipulate nodes within a session. The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions within the specified node set, ensuring that any expressions are resolved to their static values before further processing. In this case, it targets nodes three levels deep under the current node, specifically looking for nodes named [content]. This is crucial when you need to ensure that all expressions within these nodes are evaluated before performing operations like addition or insertion.
 * 
 * Following the [unwrap] operation, the [add] slot is used to append new nodes to the [.session] node. The nodes being added include a [role] node with a static value of "system" and a [content] node whose value is dynamically retrieved from the [context] node within a [signal] node. This setup is useful for scenarios where you need to dynamically build or modify a session object with evaluated content, such as setting up a user session with specific roles and context-based content.
