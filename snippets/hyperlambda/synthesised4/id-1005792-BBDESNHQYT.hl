/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate up one level in the hierarchy of the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children of the parent node obtained from the previous `.` iterator.
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "data.read" from the children nodes obtained by the `*` iterator. 
 * 
 * This expression is useful for navigating a Hyperlambda structure to find specific nodes named "data.read" that are children of the parent node of the current context. It can be used in scenarios where you need to access or manipulate data related to "data.read" nodes within a certain scope of your Hyperlambda code.
