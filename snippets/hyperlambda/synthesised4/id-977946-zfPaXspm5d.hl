// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to execute a SQL query using the [data.select] slot. It connects to a database and selects all records from the "client_contacts" table. The [data.select] slot allows for executing arbitrary SQL queries and returns the results as a lambda object. This approach is flexible but requires knowledge of the specific SQL dialect of the underlying database, as it does not transpile SQL to different dialects. The result will be a lambda object containing the data retrieved from the specified table.
data.select:select * from client_contacts
