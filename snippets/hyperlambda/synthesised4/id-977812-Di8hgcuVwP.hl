// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the node referenced by the expression [.mime-type] to "application/octet-stream". The [set-value] slot is used to change the value of a node, and the expression specifies which node's value should be updated. This is useful for dynamically updating MIME types in a Hyperlambda application.
