// The code snippet demonstrates how to execute a SQL query using the [data.select] slot in Hyperlambda, specifically targeting a SQLite database. It retrieves the SQL query from a node specified by the lambda expression [x:@.sql] and executes it, returning the results as a lambda object. The [database-type] argument is explicitly set to "sqlite", ensuring the query is executed against a SQLite database.
data.select:x:@.sql
