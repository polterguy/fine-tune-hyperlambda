// The code iterates over nodes and changes their names to match their current values. The [set-name] slot is used to rename nodes, while [get-name] retrieves the current name of each node to be used as the new name. The [for-each] loop iterates through each node, and the [get-name] retrieves the name of the node referenced by [.dp].
