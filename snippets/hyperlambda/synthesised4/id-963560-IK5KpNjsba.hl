// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of nodes to a concatenated string. The [set-name] slot targets nodes using an expression and assigns them a new name formed by concatenating "log." with the value retrieved from the [type] argument. The [strings.concat] slot combines the static string "log." with the dynamic value from the [get-value] slot, which accesses the [type] argument.
