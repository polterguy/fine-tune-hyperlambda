/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the value of the [.to] node to the second element of the result from splitting a string. The [set-value] slot is used to change the value of the [.to] node, and it takes its new value from the [get-value] slot, which retrieves the value from the second node (index 1) of the result of a [strings.split] operation. The [strings.split] operation is assumed to have been performed earlier, and its result is being accessed here. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.to] node to the value retrieved by the [get-value] slot.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the second node (index 1) from the result of a [strings.split] operation.
