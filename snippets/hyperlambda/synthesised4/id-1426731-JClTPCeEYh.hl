/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to invoke a slot with the name [match] using two arguments: [url] and [pattern]. The [url] argument is set to the value of the first node in the sorted list, while the [pattern] argument is set to the value of the currently iterated node. The [invoke] slot is used to execute the [match] slot with these arguments, likely to perform some form of pattern matching or validation. 
 * 
 * 1. [invoke] - Executes the [match] slot with the specified arguments.
 * 2. [url] - Sets the value to the first node in the sorted list.
 * 3. [pattern] - Sets the value to the currently iterated node.
