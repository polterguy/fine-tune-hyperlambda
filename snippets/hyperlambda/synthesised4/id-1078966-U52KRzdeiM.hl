/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda. In the context of an HTTP endpoint or a dynamic slot, this node would contain the parameters or arguments being passed in.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument that has been passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `/type` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "type" among the children of the "arguments" node. This is useful for accessing a specific property or attribute of the arguments, in this case, the "type" of each argument.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to validate or process the types of arguments passed to a function or endpoint. For example, ensuring that all arguments are of a certain type before performing operations on them.
 * - It could also be used in logging or debugging scenarios to record the types of arguments received by a function for audit or troubleshooting purposes.
