// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the value of all nodes referenced by the expression `./*/execute` to the value obtained from the node referenced by `@.dp/#`. The [set-value] slot is used to modify the node values, and [get-value] retrieves the current value of the node pointed to by the expression. The [./*/execute] expression targets all child nodes named "execute" under the current node, while [@.dp/#] accesses the value of the node currently being iterated over, passed by reference.
set-value:x:./*/execute
   get-value:x:@.dp/#
