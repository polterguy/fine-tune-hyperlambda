/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the value of the [scheme] node to "https" using the [set-value] slot. This operation is executed within an [else] block, which implies that it is a fallback action that occurs only if none of the preceding conditional blocks (such as [if] or [else-if]) were executed. This ensures that the [scheme] node defaults to "https" when no other conditions are met. 
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes the subsequent code block if none of the preceding conditions are met.
 * 2. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 3. [@.scheme] - The expression pointing to the [scheme] node whose value is to be set.
 * 4. [.] - The static value "https" that will be assigned to the [scheme] node.
