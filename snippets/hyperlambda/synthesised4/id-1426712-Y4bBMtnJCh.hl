 * // This Hyperlambda code removes nodes from a specified location within a Hyperlambda structure. The [remove-nodes] slot is used to delete all nodes that match the given expression. In this case, it targets nodes named "temperature" that are children of the [payload] node, which is itself a child of an [http.post] node within a nested [lambda] structure. The expression navigates through the hierarchy to find and remove these specific nodes, effectively cleaning up or modifying the structure by eliminating unwanted or redundant data.
 * // 1. [remove-nodes] - Removes nodes matching the specified expression.
 * // 2. [x:@.lambda/@.lambda/*/http.post/*/payload/*/temperature] - Expression pointing to the "temperature" nodes within the specified hierarchy to be removed.
