// This Hyperlambda code checks if a file exists by evaluating two conditions: whether the filename is not null and if the file exists. If both conditions are true, it deletes the specified file. The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, [and] ensures both conditions are met, [not-null] checks the filename's existence, and [io.file.exists] verifies the file's presence before [io.file.delete] removes it.
