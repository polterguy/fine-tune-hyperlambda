// The code establishes a connection to a SQLite database using [data.connect] and specifies the database type as SQLite. It then adds nodes to the [where] clause of a [data.delete] operation, which targets the "comments" table. The [unwrap] slot evaluates the nodes, and the [return] slot provides the number of affected rows from the delete operation. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node to build the [where] condition dynamically.
