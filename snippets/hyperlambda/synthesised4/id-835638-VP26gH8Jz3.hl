// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the value of the [aggregate_function] node within the [.arguments] node is one of the specified legal values: "min", "max", "sum", "avg", or "count". If the value does not match any of these options, an exception will be thrown. This validation is useful for ensuring that only valid aggregate functions are used in subsequent operations.
