// The [data.update] slot is used to update records in a specified table, here "roles". It requires a [values] argument to specify the columns and values to update, and a [where] clause to filter which records to update. The [where] clause uses logical conditions, such as [and], to determine the specific records that should be updated, ensuring precise control over the update operation.
