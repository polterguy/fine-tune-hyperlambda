/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet defines a signal named [magic.ai.url.scrape] that is responsible for scraping a specified URL and extracting various types of content such as images, code, lists, and main content. It also includes options for summarization and feedback. The signal uses several parameters to customize the scraping process, including the URL to scrape, the type of content to extract, and whether to include empty completions. Additionally, it allows for setting a threshold for content extraction and specifying a feedback channel for the results.
 * 
 * 1. [signal] - Declares a new signal named [magic.ai.url.scrape].
 * 2. [url] - Specifies the URL to be scraped, obtained from the first element in the [urls] node.
 * 3. [type] - Retrieves the type of content to scrape from the [type] argument.
 * 4. [images] - Boolean flag to include images in the scraping process.
 * 5. [code] - Boolean flag to include code snippets in the scraping process.
 * 6. [lists] - Boolean flag to include lists in the scraping process.
 * 7. [main] - Boolean flag to include the main content in the scraping process.
 * 8. [empty-completion] - Boolean flag to exclude empty completions from the results.
 * 9. [threshold] - Retrieves the threshold value for content extraction from the [threshold] argument.
 * 10. [summarize] - Retrieves the summarization option from the [summarize] argument.
 * 11. [feedback-channel] - Retrieves the feedback channel for the results from the [feedback-channel] argument.
