/*
 * 1. `@data.connect`: This iterator searches for the first node named "data.connect" in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further navigation through the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the previously found "data.connect" node. It allows the expression to navigate deeper into the hierarchy by accessing all children.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved child nodes to find those named "data.read". It narrows down the selection to nodes specifically named "data.read" among the children of "data.connect".
 * 
 * 4. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the previously found "data.read" node. It continues the navigation by accessing all children of the "data.read" node.
 * 
 * 5. `columns`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved child nodes to find those named "columns". It selects nodes specifically named "columns" among the children of "data.read".
 * 
 * 6. `0`: This iterator retrieves the first child node of the previously found "columns" node. It is used to select the first element in the list of columns, assuming "columns" contains multiple child nodes.
