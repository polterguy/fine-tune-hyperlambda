/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.dp] in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it looks for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the [.dp] node. It assumes that the value of the [.dp] node is itself a node, allowing you to access and manipulate the original node directly rather than working with a copy. This is useful when you need to modify the node's value or its children in place.
