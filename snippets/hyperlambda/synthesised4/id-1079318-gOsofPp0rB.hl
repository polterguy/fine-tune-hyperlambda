/*
 * This expression is used to navigate and retrieve nodes within a Hyperlambda structure. Let's break down each part of the expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@data.read`: This part of the expression uses the `@` iterator to locate the first node named `data.read`. The `@` iterator searches for a node with the specified name starting from the current context and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. It's used to pinpoint a specific node by name.
 * 
 * 2. `/*`: The `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node found by the previous part of the expression (`data.read`). This means it will return all immediate child nodes of the `data.read` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in scenarios where you need to process or manipulate all child nodes of a specific node named `data.read`. For example, if `data.read` contains a list of data entries, this expression can be used to iterate over each entry for processing, such as filtering, transforming, or aggregating data.
