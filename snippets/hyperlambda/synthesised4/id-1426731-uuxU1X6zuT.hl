/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [invoke] slot to execute a dynamic slot or lambda object. It takes a URL from the first element of a sorted list and checks if it matches a given pattern. The [invoke] slot is used to call the dynamic slot or lambda object specified by the expression in its value. The [url] and [pattern] nodes are used as arguments for the invocation. The [url] node retrieves the URL from the first node in the sorted list, while the [pattern] node retrieves the pattern from the currently iterated node by reference. This setup allows for pattern matching against URLs in a sorted list.
 * 
 * 1. [invoke] - Executes a dynamic slot or lambda object.
 * 2. [url] - Retrieves the URL from the first element of a sorted list.
 * 3. [pattern] - Retrieves the pattern from the currently iterated node by reference.
