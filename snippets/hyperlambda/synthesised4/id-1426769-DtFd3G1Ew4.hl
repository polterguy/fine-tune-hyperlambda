/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [is_nullable] node, which is a child of the node referenced by [.dp], is equal to "NO". If the condition is true, the [eq] slot will evaluate to true. This is useful for determining if a particular node's [is_nullable] attribute is set to "NO", which might be used to enforce non-null constraints or similar logic.
 * // 1. [eq] - Compares two values for equality.
 * // 2. [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/is_nullable] - Retrieves the value of the [is_nullable] node that is a child of the node referenced by [.dp].
 * // 3. [.:NO] - The static string value "NO" to compare against.
