/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the hierarchy from the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access every child node under the parent node retrieved by the previous iterator.
 * 
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "signal". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes with this specific name.
 * 
 * 4. `=` - This iterator retrieves nodes from the previous result set that have a value equal to the specified string, in this case, "magic.ai.crawl-site". It is used to further filter the nodes to those with a specific value.
 * 
 * 5. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access every child node under the nodes that matched the previous criteria.
 * 
 * 6. `.onafter` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named ".onafter". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes with this specific name.
 * 
 * 7. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access every child node under the ".onafter" nodes.
 * 
 * 8. `.feedback-channel` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named ".feedback-channel". It is used to finalize the selection to nodes with this specific name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a web crawling or data processing application where you need to find and process feedback channels associated with a specific signal related to "magic.ai.crawl-site".
 * - It could be useful in a logging or monitoring system to track feedback channels triggered after certain events in the "magic.ai.crawl-site" context.
