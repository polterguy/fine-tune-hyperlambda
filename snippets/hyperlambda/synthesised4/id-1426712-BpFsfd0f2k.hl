// This Hyperlambda code snippet dynamically adds nodes to a destination node referenced by the expression `@.session`. It creates a new node structure under this destination, where it adds a node with the name `role` and assigns it the static value `user`. It also adds a node named `content` whose value is dynamically set by retrieving the value from the node referenced by the expression `@.dp/#/*/completion`. This effectively allows the addition of user role and content information into the session node, where the content is derived from a previously defined node structure.
