// This Hyperlambda code uses logical conditions to evaluate an HTTP response status code. It checks if the status code is not more than or equal to 200 and not less than 300, effectively verifying if the status code is between 200 and 299, indicating a successful HTTP response. The [and] slot combines both conditions, ensuring both must be true for the overall evaluation to be true.
