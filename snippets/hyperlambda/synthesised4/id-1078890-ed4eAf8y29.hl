/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it is looking for a node with a specific name. This is useful when you want to access a specific node in a potentially large and complex data structure.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the node is in fact another node, allowing you to access and manipulate the node itself rather than just its value. This is useful when you need to work with the node as a reference, such as modifying its children or attributes.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous step. It is useful when you want to perform operations on all children of a particular node, such as iterating over them or filtering them based on certain criteria.
 * 
 * 4. `prompt` - This iterator filters out any nodes that do not have the name "prompt" from the previous result set. It is used to narrow down the node set to only those nodes that are relevant to the operation being performed, in this case, nodes named "prompt".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a data structure with multiple ".dp" nodes, each containing a series of child nodes, and you want to specifically access and manipulate nodes named "prompt" within these structures. For example, it could be part of a process that extracts or modifies prompt-related data in a larger dataset.
