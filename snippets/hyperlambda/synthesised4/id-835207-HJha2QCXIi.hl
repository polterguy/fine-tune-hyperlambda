/*
 * This Hyperlambda code connects to a database and executes a SQL delete statement, removing rows from the "vss_ml_training_snippets" table where the "rowid" matches IDs selected from the "ml_training_snippets" table with a specified "type". The [data.connect] slot establishes the database connection, while the [data.execute] slot performs the SQL operation using a parameterized query for the "type" value. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.connect] - Establishes a connection to the database.
 * 2. [data.execute] - Executes a SQL delete statement.
 * 3. [type] - Provides the parameter value for the SQL query's "type" condition.
