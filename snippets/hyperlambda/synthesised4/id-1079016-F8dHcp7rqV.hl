/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to access the arguments section of a Hyperlambda script or endpoint, which typically contains input parameters.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access all the arguments passed to the script or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `from` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "from" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically access the "from" argument, which might represent a starting point, source, or origin in the context of the script.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the "from" argument in an HTTP endpoint to determine the source or starting point of a request.
 * - Accessing a specific parameter in a script that processes data based on a "from" value, such as filtering or querying operations.
