// This code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to update the value of the [max_context_tokens] node within the [.model] node. It assigns the result obtained from the [math.divide] slot, which calculates a division operation, to the [max_context_tokens] node.
set-value:x:@.model/*/max_context_tokens
   get-value:x:@math.divide
