/*
 * 1. `..`: This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to access the top-level node from anywhere within the hierarchy, allowing you to navigate back to the starting point of the Hyperlambda execution context.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children of the root node. It is useful for iterating over or accessing all immediate descendants of a node.
 * 
 * 3. `return`: This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "return". It is used to specifically target nodes that are intended to return values or results in the Hyperlambda context.
 * 
 * 4. `*`: Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. Here, it retrieves all children of the "return" nodes, allowing further navigation or processing of these nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `candidates`: This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "candidates". It is used to specifically access nodes that contain candidate data or information, which might be relevant for processing or evaluation.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include retrieving a list of candidate nodes from a Hyperlambda structure that is organized with return nodes at the root level, possibly for the purpose of evaluating or processing these candidates further in the logic. It can be useful in scenarios where the Hyperlambda structure is used to manage or evaluate a set of candidate options or results.
