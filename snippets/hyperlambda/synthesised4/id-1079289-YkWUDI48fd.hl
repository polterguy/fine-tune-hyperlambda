/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda) of the current node. It is used to move downwards in the hierarchy to the next sibling node. This can be useful when you want to perform operations or checks on nodes that are at the same level in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access the immediate children of the node returned by the previous iterator. This is useful for iterating over or manipulating all child nodes of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - The second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes returned by the first `*` iterator. This allows you to access the grandchildren of the node initially targeted by the `+` iterator. This can be useful for operations that need to consider multiple levels of hierarchy, such as aggregating data from multiple nested nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to gather or manipulate data from a complex hierarchical structure where you need to access and process nodes that are siblings and their nested children. For example, in a configuration file, you might use this to apply settings to all components that are siblings and their sub-components.
