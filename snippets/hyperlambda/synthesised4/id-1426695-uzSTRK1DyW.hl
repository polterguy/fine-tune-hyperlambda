 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.tmp] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.tmp] - Retrieves the current value of the [.tmp] node.
 * 4. [.] - Represents a static newline character.
 * 5. [.] - Represents another static newline character.
 * 6. [get-value:x:@signal/*/snippets/0/*/completion] - Retrieves the value of the [completion] node within the [snippets] node.
