// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot in Hyperlambda to append a new node to a specified node set. In this example, a node with the name [automatic] and a boolean value of true is added as a child to each node referenced by the expression "@.tmp/*". This operation effectively appends the new node to the list of children nodes under the [.tmp] node. The [add] slot is commonly used to dynamically modify the structure of a Hyperlambda object by adding new nodes to it.
add:x:@.tmp/*
