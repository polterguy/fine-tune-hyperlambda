// The code retrieves the value of a node specified by its expression. It navigates through the node hierarchy to find the node with the name "Key" and returns its value. The expression uses the [get-value] slot to access the node's value, starting from the [.dp] node, de-referencing its value, and traversing its children to locate the "Key" node.
