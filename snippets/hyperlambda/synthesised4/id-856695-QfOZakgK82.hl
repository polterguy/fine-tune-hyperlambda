// The code snippet uses [set-value] to change the value of the node referenced by [.x]. It concatenates strings using [strings.concat], combining a static string "--/execute/=", the value of the [name] node from the [.dp] node's children, and a static string "/*". This effectively constructs a new string value for [.x] by dynamically including the [name] node's value.
