// This Hyperlambda code snippet updates the value of the [.new-prompt] node by concatenating a series of strings and values. It uses [strings.concat] to assemble a message that includes a static string, the value of the [workflow] node within [execute], and the result of [lambda2json]. The message is formatted to include JSON-like structure and additional static text, demonstrating how to dynamically build a string from multiple sources.
