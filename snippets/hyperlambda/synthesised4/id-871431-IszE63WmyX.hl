// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the [group_column] argument is one of the specified valid values. It checks if the [group_column] is one of the following: "clients.client_id", "clients.name", "clients.email", "clients.phone", or "clients.address". If the provided value does not match any of these, an exception is thrown, ensuring only allowed values are used.
