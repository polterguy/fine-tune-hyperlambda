// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to cryptographically sign a message using a private key. It uses the [crypto.sign] slot to sign the content of the [.result] node. The signature is returned in its raw form due to the [raw] argument being set to true. The signing process utilizes a private key and its associated fingerprint, both retrieved from the [signal] node. The signature ensures data integrity and authenticity, allowing recipients to verify the message's origin and integrity using the corresponding public key.
