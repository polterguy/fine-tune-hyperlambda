/*
 * 1. `@http.get` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "http.get" in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point of the expression, which is the "http.get" node.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "http.get" node. It is used to access the next level of nodes under "http.get".
 * 3. `headers` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "headers" from the previous result set. It is used to locate the "headers" node among the children of "http.get".
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "headers" node. It is used to access the next level of nodes under "headers".
 * 5. `Location` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "Location" from the previous result set. It is used to locate the "Location" node among the children of "headers". 
 * 
 * This expression is used to navigate through a hierarchical structure starting from a node named "http.get", accessing its children, and specifically filtering down to a node named "Location" under the "headers" node. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to extract the "Location" header from an HTTP response structure.
