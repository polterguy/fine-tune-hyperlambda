// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda evaluates expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, [unwrap] is used with an expression pointing to the next sibling node, ensuring that the value of the subsequent node is evaluated beforehand. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions within a lambda object, allowing dynamic value assignments before execution. The slot can handle multiple nodes if the [apply-lists] argument is set to true, otherwise, it throws an exception for multiple nodes.
