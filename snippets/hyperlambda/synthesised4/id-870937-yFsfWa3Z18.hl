// The code uses [set-value] to change the value of nodes at a specific path, setting it to the name of the node obtained by [get-name] from the current [for-each] iteration. The [set-value] slot targets nodes at a deeply nested path, while [get-name] retrieves the name of the current node being iterated over.
