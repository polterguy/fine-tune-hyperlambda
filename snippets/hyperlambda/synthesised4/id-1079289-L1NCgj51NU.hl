/*
 * 1. `@.fields` - This iterator searches for the first node named "fields" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, checking each node's name until it finds a match. This is useful when you need to access a specific section of a data structure that is named "fields".
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "fields" node. It is used to access each individual child node under "fields", which can be useful for iterating over a collection of items or processing each child node individually.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a data structure with a "fields" node containing multiple child nodes, and you need to perform operations on each of these child nodes, such as validation, transformation, or aggregation. For example, if "fields" represents form fields in a web application, you might use this expression to iterate over each field to apply validation rules.
