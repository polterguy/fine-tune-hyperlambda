/*
 * This Hyperlambda code updates the content of a specific node within a session object. It targets the first occurrence of a node with the role "developer" and appends a string "Formatting re-enabled\n\n" to its content. The [set-value] slot is used to change the value of the targeted node, while [strings.concat] combines the new string with the existing content. The [get-value] slot retrieves the current content of the node to ensure the new string is appended rather than replacing the existing content.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of a specified node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates a list of strings into one string.
 * 3. [.] - Represents a static value or a node.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a specified node.
