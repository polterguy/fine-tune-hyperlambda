/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and expand all expressions within the node path specified by the expression `./*/return/**`. This operation will recursively evaluate all nodes and their children under the [return] node, effectively "unwrapping" them to their final values or structures before further processing or execution. This is useful for ensuring that all dynamic expressions are resolved and their results are available for subsequent operations. 
 * 
 * 1. [unwrap] - Evaluates and expands all expressions within the specified node path.
 * 2. [./*/return/**] - The expression path that targets all nodes under the [return] node for evaluation.
