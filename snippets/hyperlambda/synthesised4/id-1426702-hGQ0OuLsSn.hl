// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [convert] slot to change the type of a node's value. In this example, the value of the [.foo] node, initially a string "57", is converted to an integer using the [convert] slot. This is achieved by specifying the type as "int" in the [convert] slot's child node. The [convert] slot allows for type conversion, including base64 encoding and decoding, provided the original value supports the conversion.
convert:true
