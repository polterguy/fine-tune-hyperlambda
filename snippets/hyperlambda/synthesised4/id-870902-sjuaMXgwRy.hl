// This Hyperlambda code snippet adds nodes to the current context using the [add] slot. It retrieves nodes using the [get-nodes] slot from the expression pointing to [data.read]'s children and adds them to the destination specified by the [add] slot's expression. This allows dynamically extending the node structure with nodes obtained from another part of the graph.
