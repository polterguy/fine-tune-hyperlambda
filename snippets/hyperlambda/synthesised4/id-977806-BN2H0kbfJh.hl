// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to select records from a database table named "users". It specifies a [limit] argument to restrict the result set to a single record. This ensures efficient data retrieval by only fetching the first record from the "users" table.
data.read
   table:users
   limit:int:1
