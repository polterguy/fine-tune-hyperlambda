/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [insert-before] slot to insert a node before the first child of the [hyper2lambda] node. It retrieves the value from the [prompt] node within the current context and inserts it as a child node under the newly created node. This allows dynamic modification of the lambda hierarchy by inserting new data before existing nodes. 
 * 
 * 1. [insert-before] - Inserts a new node before the specified node in the hierarchy.
 * 2. [x:@hyper2lambda/0] - Specifies the target node before which the new node will be inserted.
 * 3. [.] - Represents the new node to be inserted.
 * 4. [..:x:@.dp/#/*/prompt] - Retrieves the value from the [prompt] node and assigns it to the new node.
