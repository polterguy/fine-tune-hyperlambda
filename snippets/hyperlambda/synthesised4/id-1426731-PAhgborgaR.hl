/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [validators.mandatory] slot to ensure that at least one node exists within the specified path. It checks if there is at least one child node under the [sitemap] node within the [.arguments] node. If no such node exists, an exception will be thrown. This is useful for validating that a required structure or data segment is present in the input. 
 * 
 * 1. [validators.mandatory] - Ensures that the specified node path exists and contains at least one node, throwing an exception if not.
 * 2. [x:@.arguments/*/sitemap/*/[0,1]] - The expression used to locate the node path to validate, checking for at least one child node under [sitemap].
