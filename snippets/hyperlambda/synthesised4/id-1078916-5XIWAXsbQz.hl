/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It is used to locate the `.arguments` node in the hierarchy, which typically contains the arguments or parameters passed to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument or parameter node within the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `button` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `button`. It is used to specifically target the `button` node among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda script to retrieve the value of a `button` argument passed to a function or slot. This is useful in scenarios where you need to perform operations based on the specific button that was pressed in a user interface, such as handling different actions for different buttons in a web application.
