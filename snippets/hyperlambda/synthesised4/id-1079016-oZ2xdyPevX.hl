/*
 * 1. `@.has-sent-waiting`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "has-sent-waiting" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with this specific name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for checking the status or presence of a specific node within a larger Hyperlambda structure, particularly if you want to verify if a certain condition or flag (like "has-sent-waiting") is set or exists.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Checking if a message or notification has been sent and is currently in a "waiting" state.
 * - Verifying the existence of a flag that indicates a pending action or process within a workflow.
