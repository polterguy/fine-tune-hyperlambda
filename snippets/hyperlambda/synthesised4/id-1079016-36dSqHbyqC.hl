/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks through its siblings and upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a match. This is useful when you want to locate a specific node by name, regardless of its position relative to the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: Once the "hyper2lambda" node is found, this iterator retrieves all of its children nodes. This is useful when you want to perform operations or extract information from all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to gather all configuration or data nodes under a specific "hyper2lambda" node, allowing further processing or evaluation of these child nodes.
