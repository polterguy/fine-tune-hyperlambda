/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses a [switch] statement to evaluate the HTTP verb from a data payload. It handles three cases: [post], [put], and [patch]. For these cases, it unwraps the nested nodes and uses [insert-after] to add [consumes] and [produces] nodes after the [operationId] node in the buffer, setting the [produces] node to "application/json". The code dynamically modifies the node structure based on the HTTP verb. 
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Evaluates the HTTP verb from the data payload.
 * 2. [case] - Handles specific HTTP verbs: post, put, and patch.
 * 3. [unwrap] - Unwraps nested nodes for further processing.
 * 4. [insert-after] - Inserts new nodes after the [operationId] node in the buffer.
 * 5. [consumes] - Adds a node indicating the content type consumed.
 * 6. [produces] - Sets the content type produced to "application/json".
