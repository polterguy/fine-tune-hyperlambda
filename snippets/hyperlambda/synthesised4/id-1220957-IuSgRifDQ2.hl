// Retrieves all grand children nodes of the elder sibling (next node) of the current node. This expression is useful for accessing nested data structures where you need to process or evaluate the grand children of a node that is positioned immediately after the current node in the hierarchy. Potential use cases include data transformation tasks where you need to extract or manipulate deeply nested information from a sequence of nodes.
