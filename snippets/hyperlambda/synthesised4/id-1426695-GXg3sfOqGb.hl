// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [validators.string] slot to enforce a string length constraint on the [query] argument. The validator ensures that the length of the string in the [query] node is between 2 and 200 characters. If the string length is outside this range, an exception will be thrown. This is useful for validating input data to ensure it meets specific length requirements.
