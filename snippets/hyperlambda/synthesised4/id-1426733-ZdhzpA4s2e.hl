 * // This Hyperlambda code checks if the result of an HTTP POST request is greater than or equal to 200. The [mte] slot is used to compare the result of the HTTP POST invocation with the integer value 200. If the condition is true, it implies that the HTTP POST request was successful, as HTTP status codes 200 and above typically indicate success.
 * // 1. [mte] - This slot is used to compare if the result of the HTTP POST request is greater than or equal to 200.
 * // 2. [x:@http.post] - This expression retrieves the result of the HTTP POST request.
 * // 3. [.:int:200] - This node specifies the integer value 200 to compare against the result of the HTTP POST request.
