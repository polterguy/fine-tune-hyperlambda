// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [insert-after] slot to insert a new node after a specified node within a Hyperlambda structure. Here, [insert-after] is used to add a node with the name [task2] and value "Next task in queue" immediately after the node [task1] within the [tasks] node. The expression [x:@.tasks/*/task1] identifies the location where the new node should be inserted.
insert-after:x:@.tasks/*/task1

      task2:Next task in queue
