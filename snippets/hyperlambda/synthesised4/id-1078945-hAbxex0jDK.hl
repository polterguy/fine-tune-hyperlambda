/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator looks for the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors. The "arguments" node typically contains input parameters or arguments for a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "arguments" node. It allows access to each argument passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `supervised`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "supervised" among the children of the "arguments" node. It effectively selects the specific argument named "supervised" from the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to access a specific argument named "supervised" from a list of arguments passed to a function or slot. It ensures that you can directly retrieve and work with the "supervised" argument without manually iterating through all arguments.
