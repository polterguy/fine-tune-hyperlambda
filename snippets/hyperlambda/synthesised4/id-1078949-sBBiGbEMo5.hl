/*
 * 1. `@execute-file` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "execute-file" from the current context. It is used to locate a specific node that is responsible for executing a file, typically containing Hyperlambda code.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "execute-file" node. It is used to access any parameters or configurations that are passed to the file execution process.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to gather all arguments or configurations that are provided to an "execute-file" node, which might be necessary for debugging or logging purposes.
 * - It can also be used to dynamically inspect or modify the parameters before executing a file, allowing for more flexible and adaptable code execution.
