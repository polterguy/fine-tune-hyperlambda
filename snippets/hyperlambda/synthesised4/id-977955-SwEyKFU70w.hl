// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to select records from a database table named "experiments". The [limit] slot is used to restrict the number of records returned to 25, ensuring efficient data retrieval and preventing excessive data load on the database. The [table] slot specifies the target table for the query.
data.read
   table:experiments
   limit:int:25
