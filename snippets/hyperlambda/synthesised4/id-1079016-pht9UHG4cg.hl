 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before in its hierarchy that matches the given name. In this case, it looks for the first node named "user-id" in the hierarchy. It is used to find a specific node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve the value of a "user-id" node from a larger data structure, such as when you need to access the user ID in a user profile or session data.
