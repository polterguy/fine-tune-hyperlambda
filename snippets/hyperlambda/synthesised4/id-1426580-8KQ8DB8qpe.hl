// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database using a generic connection type labeled "magic" and executes a SQL query to count the number of entries in the "log_entries" table. The result of this operation will be a single scalar value representing the total count of records in the specified table.
data.connect:[generic|magic]
   data.select:select count(*) from log_entries
