// 1. `@.words`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "words" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It is used to access a specific node by its name, starting from the current node's position and moving upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node that may not be a direct child or sibling of the current node but is located somewhere above it in the hierarchy.
