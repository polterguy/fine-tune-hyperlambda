/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the hierarchy from the current node's position.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used here to access all children of the parent node retrieved by the previous iterator.
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "signal" from the previously retrieved children nodes.
 * 4. `=` - This iterator retrieves nodes with a specific value from the previous result set. Here, it is used to find nodes with the value "magic.ai.crawl-site" among the "signal" nodes.
 * 5. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used here to access all children of the nodes with the value "magic.ai.crawl-site".
 * 6. `.onafter` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the hierarchy from the current node's position.
 * 7. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used here to access all children of the ".onafter" node.
 * 8. `.url` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the hierarchy from the current node's position.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to find and process all URLs associated with a specific signal type ("magic.ai.crawl-site") within a complex node structure. It might be useful in web crawling or data extraction tasks where URLs need to be dynamically identified and processed based on their hierarchical context.
