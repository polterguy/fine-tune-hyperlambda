/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to retrieve the type name of a node's value. The [type] slot is used to determine the data type of a node's value in Hyperlambda. In this example, the [type] slot is applied to a node with an integer value to return the type name "int".
 * 
 * 1. [type] - This slot is used to retrieve the type name of a node's value.
