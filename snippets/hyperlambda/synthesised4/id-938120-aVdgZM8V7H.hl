// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database labeled "foo" and executes a scalar SQL query to count the number of entries in "table1". The result of this query is then stored in the [.res] node using the [set-value] slot. The [data.connect] slot establishes the connection, while [data.scalar] executes the SQL query, returning a single aggregate value.
data.connect:foo
   set-value:x:@.res
      data.scalar:select count(*) from table1
