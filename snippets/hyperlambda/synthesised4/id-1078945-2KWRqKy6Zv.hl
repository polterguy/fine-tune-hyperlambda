/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "new-prompt" at the same level or higher in the hierarchy from the current node. It does not traverse siblings but rather looks for the node in the current node's ancestry. This is useful when you need to access a specific ancestor node by name, and you want to ensure that you are not traversing sibling nodes that might have the same name. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or metadata nodes defined at the root or higher levels in a Hyperlambda file.
 * - Retrieving a common ancestor node to apply changes or retrieve data that affects multiple sibling nodes.
