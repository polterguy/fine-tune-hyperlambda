// The code uses an [else] block to execute a [set-value] operation on the [result] node. It employs [strings.replace] to replace occurrences of a specific placeholder ([[follow_up]]) within the [result] node's value with the string "false". The [else] block ensures this operation is executed if preceding conditions in an [if] or [else-if] block evaluate to false.
