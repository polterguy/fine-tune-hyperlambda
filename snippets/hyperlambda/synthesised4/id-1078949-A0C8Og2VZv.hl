/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It starts the traversal from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for locating a specific node when you know its name but not its exact location.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "hyper2lambda" node. It's used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing you to perform operations on each child node.
 * 
 * 3. `.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node set, which is expected to be named ".arguments". This is typically used in Hyperlambda to access the arguments node of a function or endpoint, which contains input parameters.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the ".arguments" node. It allows you to access all argument nodes, which may represent different input parameters for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 5. `_session` - This iterator filters the current node set to include only nodes named "_session". It's used to specifically target nodes that are expected to hold session-related information.
 * 
 * 6. `=string` - This iterator filters the node set to include only nodes whose value is exactly "string". It's used to ensure that the nodes being accessed or manipulated have a specific value, which in this case is "string".
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression might include verifying that a session-related argument in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint is correctly set to the string "string", or filtering nodes to find specific session parameters that match a given string value.
