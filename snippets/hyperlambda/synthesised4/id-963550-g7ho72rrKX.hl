/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to insert a new record into the "ml_training_snippets" table using the [data.create] slot. It retrieves values for the fields "type," "prompt," "completion," and "meta" from the provided arguments and the current data pointer. The slot ensures that dynamic data is safely inserted into the database, preventing SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.create] - Initiates the creation of a new database record.
 * 2. [table] - Specifies the target table "ml_training_snippets" for the record insertion.
 * 3. [values] - Contains the fields and their respective values to be inserted into the table.
 * 4. [type] - Retrieves the "type" value from the arguments.
 * 5. [prompt] - Retrieves the "prompt" value from the current data pointer.
 * 6. [completion] - Retrieves the "completion" value from the current data pointer.
 * 7. [meta] - Retrieves the "meta" value from the arguments.
