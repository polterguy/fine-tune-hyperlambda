// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [performance] node to "Fail". The [set-value] slot takes an expression pointing to the node whose value needs to be changed and assigns it the value provided in its child node. In this case, the expression points to the [.performance] node, and the value "Fail" is assigned to it.
set-value:x:@.performance
   .:Fail
