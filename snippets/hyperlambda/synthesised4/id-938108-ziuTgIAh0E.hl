 * The code uses [set-value] to change the value of nodes under [.output] to the value of the currently iterated node in a [for-each] loop, using [get-name] to dynamically reference node names. 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of nodes under [.output].
 * 2. [get-name] - Retrieves the name of the current node.
 * 3. [get-value] - Gets the value of the current node being iterated.
