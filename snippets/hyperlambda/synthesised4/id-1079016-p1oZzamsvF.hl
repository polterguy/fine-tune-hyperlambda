/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing the arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which typically contains input parameters or data passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any parameters or data elements that are directly under the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `stream` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "stream" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is useful for accessing a specific parameter or data element named "stream" that is expected to be a child of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to access and manipulate a "stream" parameter passed as part of the input arguments. For example, it could be used to retrieve a data stream for processing or validation purposes.
