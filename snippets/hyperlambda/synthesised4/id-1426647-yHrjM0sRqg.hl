/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [hyper2lambda] slot to convert the content of a file, loaded using the [load-file] slot, into a lambda object. The [load-file] slot takes a file path as an argument and returns its content as text. The [hyper2lambda] slot then transforms this text into a semantic lambda object that can be executed or manipulated within Hyperlambda. The expression `x:@load-file` indicates that the content to be transformed is obtained from the result of the [load-file] operation.
 * 
 * 1. [hyper2lambda] - Transforms the text content of a file into a lambda object.
 * 2. [load-file] - Loads the content of a specified file path as text.
