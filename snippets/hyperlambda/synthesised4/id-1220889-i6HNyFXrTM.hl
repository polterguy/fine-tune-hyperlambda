// Retrieves all children nodes of the previous node's younger sibling (the node above it in the Hyperlambda structure). This expression is useful for accessing and processing data that is hierarchically structured, where you need to evaluate or manipulate the children of a node that is a sibling of the current node. Potential use cases include iterating over sibling nodes' children for data transformation or aggregation tasks.
