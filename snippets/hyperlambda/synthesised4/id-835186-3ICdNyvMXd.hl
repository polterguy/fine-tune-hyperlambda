// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda evaluates expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing for forward evaluation. In this example, [unwrap] is used with an expression that navigates to a specific node using iterators, effectively evaluating and setting the value of the target node before execution continues. This is particularly useful for dynamically determining node values in complex node structures.
