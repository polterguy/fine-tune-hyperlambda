/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement to perform conditional logic based on the value of a specified node. The [switch] slot evaluates the expression provided, and the [case] slots define specific conditions to match against the evaluated value. If a match is found, the corresponding [case] block is executed. If no match is found, the [default] block is executed if it is defined. This structure allows for efficient branching based on multiple potential values.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Evaluates an expression and determines which [case] block to execute based on the result.
 * 2. [case] - Defines a condition to match against the value evaluated by [switch].
 * 3. [default] - Executes if no [case] conditions are met.
