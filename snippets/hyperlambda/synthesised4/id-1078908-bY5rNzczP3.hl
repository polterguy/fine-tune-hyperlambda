/*
 * 1. `@.host`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "host" that is an ancestor of the current node in the hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy to find the first matching node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access configuration or environment settings stored in a "host" node that is defined higher up in the hierarchy.
 * - It can be useful for retrieving server-related information, such as the hostname or IP address, that is stored in a common ancestor node named "host".
