// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [yield] slot to return the result of a [strings.concat] operation. The [yield] slot is used to return values from a dynamic slot or an executed file, and in this case, it returns the concatenated string result from the [strings.concat] operation. The [signature] node is used to specify the expression pointing to the [strings.concat] operation, which is the source of the returned value.
yield
   signature:x:@strings.concat
