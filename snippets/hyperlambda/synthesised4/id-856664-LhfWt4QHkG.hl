// The code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to modify the value of the [.sql] node by appending a string. It concatenates the current value of [.sql] with the string " and type = @type" using [strings.concat]. This operation effectively updates the SQL query stored in [.sql] to include an additional condition for filtering by type.
