// This Hyperlambda code snippet retrieves nodes using [get-nodes] from a specific path and adds them to a target node using [add]. The [get-nodes] slot fetches nodes from the path specified in its expression, which includes nodes under [try] and [signal]. The [add] slot then appends these nodes to a node named [snippets] located in a specific hierarchy path. The code effectively collects and organizes nodes related to [signal] within a [try] block into a consolidated structure for further processing or analysis.
