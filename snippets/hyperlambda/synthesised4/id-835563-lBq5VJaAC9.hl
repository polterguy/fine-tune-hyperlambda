// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to concatenate a string to an existing SQL query. It uses the [set-value] slot to modify the value of the [.sql] node by appending the string ") as keyword_count" to it. The [strings.concat] slot is used to perform the concatenation, taking the current value of [.sql] and appending the specified string. This is useful for dynamically building SQL queries by adding additional clauses or expressions.
set-value:x:@.sql
   strings.concat:x:@.sql
      get-value:x:@.sql
      .:) as keyword_count
