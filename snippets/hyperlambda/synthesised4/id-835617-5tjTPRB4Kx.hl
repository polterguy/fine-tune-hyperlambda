 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [remove-nodes] slot to delete specific nodes. It targets nodes named "distinct_column" within the children of the [.arguments] node, effectively removing them from the structure. This operation is useful for cleaning up or modifying node collections by eliminating unwanted nodes.
 * 
 * 1. [remove-nodes] - Removes all nodes that match the expression, specifically targeting nodes named "distinct_column" within the children of the [.arguments] node.
