// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specified string within another string. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first argument specifies the string to be replaced, and the second argument specifies the replacement string. In this example, the [strings.replace] slot is used to replace occurrences of the string referenced by [[references]] with the string "false" within the node pointed to by the expression [@.result].
strings.replace:x:@.result
   .:[[references]]
   .:false
