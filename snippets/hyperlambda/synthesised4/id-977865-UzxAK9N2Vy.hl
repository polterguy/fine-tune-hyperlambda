/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions: whether a feature is enabled and whether a user is logged in. If both conditions return true, the [and] slot will evaluate to true. This construct is useful for executing subsequent logic only when both conditions are satisfied, ensuring that a feature is accessible only to logged-in users. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Evaluates to true only if all its child conditions are true.
 * 2. [get-value:x:@.feature-enabled] - Retrieves the value of the [feature-enabled] node.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.user-logged-in] - Retrieves the value of the [user-logged-in] node.
