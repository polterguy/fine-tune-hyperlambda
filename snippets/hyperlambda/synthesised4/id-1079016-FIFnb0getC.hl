/*
 * 1. `@http.post` - This iterator looks for the first node named `http.post` in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary, but does not traverse siblings.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the `http.post` node. It allows the expression to access any child node under `http.post`.
 * 
 * 3. `content` - This filters the result set to only include nodes named `content` from the previously retrieved children nodes of `http.post`.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the `content` node. It allows the expression to access any child node under `content`.
 * 
 * 5. `error` - This filters the result set to only include nodes named `error` from the previously retrieved children nodes of `content`.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the `error` node. It allows the expression to access any child node under `error`.
 * 
 * 7. `message` - This filters the result set to only include nodes named `message` from the previously retrieved children nodes of `error`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract error messages from an HTTP POST response structure. It is useful in error handling scenarios where you need to log or display specific error messages returned from an API.
