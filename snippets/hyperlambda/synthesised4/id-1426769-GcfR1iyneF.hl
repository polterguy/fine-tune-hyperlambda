/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to add a node with a boolean value to a temporary node collection. The [else] slot is executed when none of the preceding conditional slots (such as [if] or [else-if]) evaluate to true. In this example, the [else] slot adds a node named [nullable] with a boolean value of true to the children of the node referenced by the expression [@.tmp/*]. This is useful for handling default actions when no other conditions are met.
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes the following block if no preceding conditions are true.
 * 2. [add] - Adds nodes to the destination node specified by the expression.
 * 3. [.] - Represents the collection of nodes to be added.
 * 4. [nullable] - A node with a boolean value set to true, added to the destination.
