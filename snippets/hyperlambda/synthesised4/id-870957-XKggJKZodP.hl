// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to assign a value to a node. It retrieves the first element from a split string operation using [get-value] with [strings.split/0] and assigns it to the node referenced by [@.module-name]. The [strings.split] operation is expected to have been executed previously, splitting a string into multiple parts.
set-value:x:@.module-name
   get-value:x:@strings.split/0
