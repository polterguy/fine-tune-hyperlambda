// The code snippet uses the [eq] slot to compare the value obtained from the [get-value] slot, which points to the [column_default] node within the [.dp] node, to a static value. The [eq] slot evaluates to true if the values are exactly the same. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the specified node, allowing for comparison.
