/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [remove-nodes] slot to remove a subset of nodes from a node set. The [remove-nodes] slot is used to delete all nodes that its expression points to. In this example, it targets nodes within a specific range of indices from the result of a [strings.split] operation. The expression [15,20] specifies that the nodes from index 15 to 34 (20 nodes in total) should be removed from the node set generated by [strings.split].
 * 
 * 1. [remove-nodes] - Removes nodes from the node set specified by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.split] - The node set from which nodes are being removed.
 * 3. [15,20] - Specifies the range of nodes to be removed, starting from index 15 and removing 20 nodes in total.
