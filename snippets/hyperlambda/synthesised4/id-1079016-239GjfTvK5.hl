/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" from the current node's context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, starting from the current node and looking at its siblings and then upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to access session-related data within a Hyperlambda script, such as retrieving user session information or session-specific variables.
 * - It might be used in a web application to manage user sessions, ensuring that the script can dynamically access and manipulate session data as needed.
