// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to insert a new record into a "products" table without returning the ID of the inserted record. The [data.create] slot is used with a [table] argument specifying the target table, and a [values] node containing the columns and their respective values to be inserted. The [return-id] argument is set to false, indicating that the ID of the inserted record should not be returned. The values include a product name, price, and stock status.
data.create
   table:products
   return-id:bool:false
   values
      name:Magic Wand
      price:double:49.99
      in_stock:bool:true
