/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the hierarchy from the current node's position.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It allows you to access all nodes directly under the parent node retrieved by the `.` iterator.
 * 
 * 3. `invoke` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "invoke" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically target nodes named "invoke".
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set, which in this case are the children of the "invoke" nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `.callback` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name ".callback" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically target nodes named ".callback".
 * 
 * Potential Use Cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to find and process callback nodes associated with invoke operations within a parent node. For example, in a system where each parent node represents a task, and each task has multiple invoke operations, this expression helps in retrieving all callback nodes to handle the results or responses of these operations.
