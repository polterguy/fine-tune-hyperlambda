// This Hyperlambda code snippet constructs a file path for a public key by concatenating a directory path, a fingerprint, and a file extension. The [set-value] slot assigns this concatenated string to the [.public-key-filename] node. The [strings.concat] slot combines the directory path "/etc/system/crypto/keys/public-", the fingerprint value retrieved by [get-value], and the file extension ".key". This results in a complete file path for storing or referencing a public key.
