// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced, allowing for "forward evaluation". In this example, the expression [x:+/*/*] is evaluated, and its result is assigned to the node where [unwrap] is used. This is useful for dynamically determining node values in Hyperlambda.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
