/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate all the arguments provided to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `search_postfix` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "search_postfix" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target the "search_postfix" argument for further operations or evaluations.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function or slot to retrieve the value of a specific argument named "search_postfix" that has been passed to it. This is useful in scenarios where the function needs to perform operations based on the "search_postfix" value, such as filtering or searching data.
