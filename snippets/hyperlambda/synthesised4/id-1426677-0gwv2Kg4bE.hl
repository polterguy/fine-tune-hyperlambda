/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is used to insert a new record into a database table named "ml_training_snippets". The record includes values for the fields "type", "prompt", "completion", and "uri". The "type" field's value is dynamically retrieved, while the "prompt" and "completion" fields contain specific text strings, and "uri" holds a URL. This operation is typically used for storing training data for machine learning models.
 * 
 * 1. [data.create] - Initiates the creation of a new record in the specified database table.
 * 2. [table] - Specifies the name of the table where the record will be inserted.
 * 3. [values] - Contains the fields and their corresponding values for the new record.
 * 4. [type] - A field in the record, with its value dynamically retrieved from another node.
 * 5. [prompt] - A field in the record, containing a static text string as its value.
 * 6. [completion] - A field in the record, containing a static text string as its value, which is a detailed response to the prompt.
 * 7. [uri] - A field in the record, containing a static URL string as its value.
