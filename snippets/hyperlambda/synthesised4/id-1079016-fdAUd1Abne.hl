/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator searches for the first node named "result" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "result" node it encounters. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve the value of a "result" node that is located somewhere above the current node in the hierarchy. This is useful in scenarios where you need to access a result value that has been computed or set earlier in the execution flow and is not a direct child of the current node.
