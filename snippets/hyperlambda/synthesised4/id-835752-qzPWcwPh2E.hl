// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a collection. It retrieves nodes specified by the expressions in [get-nodes] and adds them to the collection at the path "./*/data.read". The [get-nodes] slots fetch nodes from the [.arguments] node, specifically the [order] and [direction] nodes, and these are then added to the target collection.
add:x:./*/data.read
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/order
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/direction
