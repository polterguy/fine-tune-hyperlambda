// Concatenates a directory path, a SHA256 hash of a joined string, and a file extension into a single string. The [strings.concat] slot combines these elements, with [crypto.hash.sha256] generating a hash from the joined string, resulting in a complete file path with a hashed filename and ".js" extension.
