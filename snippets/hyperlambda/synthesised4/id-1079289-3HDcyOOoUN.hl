// 1. `@.no`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first matching node it encounters. This is useful when you need to access a specific ancestor node named "no" in a nested structure. A potential use case could be to retrieve configuration or settings stored in a parent node named "no" that applies to the current context.
