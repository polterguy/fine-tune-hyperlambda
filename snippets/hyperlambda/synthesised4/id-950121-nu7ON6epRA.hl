/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append a new node to the [.results] node. The new node contains two child nodes: [name], which retrieves its value using the [get-name] slot, and [status], which is statically set to "checked". This operation effectively adds a structured entry to the [.results] node, capturing the name of a node and marking its status. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends a new node to the [.results] node.
 * 2. [name] - Retrieves the name of a node using the [get-name] slot.
 * 3. [status] - Sets the status of the node to "checked".
