// This Hyperlambda code connects to the "hrdb" database and reads data from the "employees" table. It selects the "first_name", "last_name", and "title" columns, limiting the result to a single record. The [data.connect] slot establishes the database connection, while [data.read] specifies the table and columns to retrieve, with [limit] restricting the number of records returned.
