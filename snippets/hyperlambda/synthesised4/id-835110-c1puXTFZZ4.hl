// Executes a Hyperlambda file specified by the value of the [.dp] node. The [io.file.execute] slot treats the file as a dynamic slot, allowing you to pass arguments through an [.arguments] node. This enables the invocation of a file as if it were a dynamically created slot, similar to the [signal] slot from the magic.lambda.slots project.
