// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement to execute a specific block of code based on the value of a given expression. The [case] slot is used to define a condition that, when met, triggers the execution of its associated code block. The [switch] statement evaluates the expression and matches it against the [case] conditions, executing the corresponding code block if a match is found. This allows for structured conditional branching based on multiple potential values of an expression.
