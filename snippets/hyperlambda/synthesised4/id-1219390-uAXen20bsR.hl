// Retrieves all [and] nodes that are descendants of any [where] nodes, which in turn are descendants of any [data.delete] nodes, starting from the current node's parent. This expression is useful for finding complex conditional logic within a data deletion operation, allowing you to analyze or modify the conditions under which data is being deleted. Potential use cases include auditing deletion conditions in a database operation or dynamically altering the conditions for data deletion based on runtime parameters.
