/*
 * 1. `@.pk`: This iterator searches for the first node named "pk" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node with the specified name. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a primary key value from a node structure where the primary key is stored in a node named "pk" somewhere above the current context.
 * - Accessing configuration or metadata information stored in a node named "pk" that is relevant to the current processing context.
