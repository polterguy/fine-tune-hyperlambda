// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the node [.no-invocation] is equal to 0 using the [eq] slot. If the condition is true, it enters the [.lambda] block and increments the value of [.no-invocation] by 1 using the [math.increment] slot. The code effectively ensures that if [.no-invocation] starts at 0, it will be increased to 1.
