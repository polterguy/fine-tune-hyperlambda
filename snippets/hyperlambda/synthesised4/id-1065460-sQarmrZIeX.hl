// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it should search for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name within the current scope, such as retrieving a SQL query or command stored in a node named "sql".
