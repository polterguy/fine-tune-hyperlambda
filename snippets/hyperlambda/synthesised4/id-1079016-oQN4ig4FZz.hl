/*
 * 1. `@json2lambda`: This iterator searches for the first node named "json2lambda" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the node hierarchy until it finds a node with this name. This is useful when you want to access a specific node by name without knowing its exact position in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "json2lambda" node. It is used to access any node directly under "json2lambda", regardless of their names. This is helpful when you want to process or evaluate all immediate children of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `done_reason`: This iterator filters the results from the previous step to only include nodes named "done_reason". It is used to narrow down the node set to those with a specific name, which is useful when you are interested in a particular type of information or data point among the children nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a scenario where you have a JSON-like structure converted to Hyperlambda and you want to find out the reason why a certain process or task was marked as done, indicated by the "done_reason" node under a "json2lambda" node.
 * - It could be used in logging or debugging to extract and analyze reasons for task completion from a structured data set.
