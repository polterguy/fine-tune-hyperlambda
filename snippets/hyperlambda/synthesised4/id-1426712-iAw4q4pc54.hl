// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [model] node within the [.arguments] node is equal to "o3-mini". If the condition is true, it executes a lambda object that renames the [max_tokens] node within the [payload] of an [http.post] request to [max_completion_tokens] and removes the [temperature] node from the same [payload]. This is useful for dynamically modifying HTTP request payloads based on specific conditions. The code uses the [if] slot for conditional execution, [eq] for equality comparison, [set-name] for renaming nodes, and [remove-nodes] for deleting nodes.
