/*
 * 1. `@.dp`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" from the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you want to access a specific node by name within the current scope.
 * 
 * 2. `#`: This iterator de-references the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is itself a node, and it returns this node by reference. This is particularly useful when you need to manipulate or access the original node that is stored as the value of another node, allowing for operations that affect the original node rather than a copy.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing and modifying a node that is stored as the value of another node, such as when iterating over a collection of nodes and needing to update their values directly.
 * - Retrieving a configuration or data node that is stored as a reference within another node, allowing for dynamic updates or evaluations based on the referenced node's content.
