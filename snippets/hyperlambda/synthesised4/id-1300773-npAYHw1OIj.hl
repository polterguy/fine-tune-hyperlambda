// This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to read data from a database table named "Employee". It selects specific columns, namely "EmployeeId" and "FullName", from the "Employee" table. The selection is filtered using a "where" condition that checks if the "DepartmentId" of the employee matches a dynamically determined value. This value is retrieved by evaluating the expression `x:@.dp/#/*/DepartmentId`, which points to a node that is passed by reference, typically representing the current data point in a loop or a similar construct. The result of the data read operation is then yielded, meaning it is returned or outputted, as a list of "employees". This setup is useful for dynamically filtering employee records based on their department, possibly within a larger data processing routine.
