// This Hyperlambda code uses the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions. It checks if a node named [instruction] exists as a child of the [.arguments] node using [exists], and simultaneously verifies that the value of this [instruction] node is not empty using [neq]. Both conditions must be true for the [and] slot to evaluate to true.
