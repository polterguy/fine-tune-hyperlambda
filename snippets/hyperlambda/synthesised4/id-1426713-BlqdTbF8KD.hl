 * // This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named "cached" exists as a child of the "signal" node. If it does, it evaluates the children of the current node using [unwrap], and returns a result with the value of the "cached" node, along with a "finish_reason" indicating the result was cached.
 * // 
 * // 1. [if] - Checks if a node named "cached" exists as a child of the "signal" node.
 * // 2. [exists:x:@signal/*/cached] - The condition for the [if] statement, checking for the existence of the "cached" node.
 * // 3. [.lambda] - The block of code to execute if the condition is true.
 * // 4. [unwrap:x:+/*] - Evaluates the children of the current node.
 * // 5. [return] - Returns a result if the condition is true.
 * // 6. [result:x:@signal/*/cached] - Retrieves the value of the "cached" node to return.
 * // 7. [finish_reason:cached] - Indicates the result was retrieved from the cache.
