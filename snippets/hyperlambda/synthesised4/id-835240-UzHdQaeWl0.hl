// The [switch] slot in Hyperlambda is used to execute different code blocks based on the value of an expression. It contains [case] nodes, each with a value to match against the [switch] expression. If a match is found, the corresponding [case] node is executed. If no match is found, the [default] node, if present, is executed. The [switch] slot is similar to a switch/case statement in traditional programming languages, allowing for conditional branching based on specific values.
