/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate up one level in the hierarchy of the Hyperlambda structure. In the context of this expression, it is used to access the parent node of the node where this expression is being evaluated.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. After moving up to the parent node with the previous iterator, this iterator will gather all the children nodes of that parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `fork` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "fork". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes that are specifically named "fork" among the children nodes of the parent node.
 * 
 * 4. `0` - This iterator retrieves the first child node of the current result set. After filtering for nodes named "fork", this iterator selects the first such node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access the first "fork" node among the children of a parent node, perhaps to evaluate or manipulate its contents.
 * - It might be useful in a workflow where "fork" nodes represent decision points or branches, and you need to programmatically determine the first branch to process.
