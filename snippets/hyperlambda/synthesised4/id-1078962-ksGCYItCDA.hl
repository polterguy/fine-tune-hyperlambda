/*
 * 1. `@.description`: This iterator searches for the first node named "description" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate a specific node named "description" that might be located at various levels in the node hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a description node to display or log its content.
 * - Modifying the content of a description node in a larger data structure.
