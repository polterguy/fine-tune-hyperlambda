// 1. `@.base-url`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "base-url" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` before "base-url" specifies that it should start the search from the current node's context. This expression is useful when you need to retrieve the value of a configuration or setting node named "base-url" that is expected to be found in the current context or hierarchy. A potential use case could be retrieving the base URL for constructing API endpoints or web service calls within a Hyperlambda script.
