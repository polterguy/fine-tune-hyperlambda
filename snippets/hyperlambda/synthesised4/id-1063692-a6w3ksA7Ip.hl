/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [arguments] from the current context. It is used to access the node where arguments for the current operation or function are stored. This is useful in scenarios where you need to access input parameters or arguments passed to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [arguments] node. It is used to access each individual argument passed to the function or slot, allowing for iteration or further filtering.
 * 
 * 3. `email` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named [email]. It is used to specifically access the node containing the email argument, which is useful when you need to perform operations on or retrieve the value of the email parameter.
