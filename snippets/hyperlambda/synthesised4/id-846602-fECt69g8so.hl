// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression [@.arguments/*/aggregate_column]. The [get-value] slot is used to access the value of a node, and in this case, it points to a node named [aggregate_column] that is a child of the [arguments] node. This allows you to dynamically access and use the value of the [aggregate_column] node in further operations or logic.
