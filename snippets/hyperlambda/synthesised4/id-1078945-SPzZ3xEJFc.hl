 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "http.post" node. It is used to access the next level of nodes under the HTTP POST request node.
 * 
 * 3. `content` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "content". It is used to narrow down the search to nodes specifically named "content" under the HTTP POST request.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "content" node. It is used to access the next level of nodes under the "content" node.
 * 
 * 5. `error` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "error". It is used to narrow down the search to nodes specifically named "error" under the "content" node.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "error" node. It is used to access the next level of nodes under the "error" node.
 * 
 * 7. `message` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "message". It is used to locate the specific node that contains the error message under the "error" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract error messages from the content of an HTTP POST request response. It is useful for logging, debugging, or displaying error messages to users in a web application.
