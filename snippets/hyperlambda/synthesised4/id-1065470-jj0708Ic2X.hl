/*
 * 1. `@.fields` - This iterator searches for the first node named "fields" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary, but it will not traverse siblings.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "fields" node. It collects all direct descendants of the "fields" node, allowing you to access or manipulate them as needed.
 * 
 * This expression is useful when you need to access all child nodes of a specific node named "fields" within the current context, such as when iterating over fields in a data structure or configuration.
