// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve a set of nodes. The expression provided to [get-nodes] points to all child nodes of the [invoke] node. This allows you to access and manipulate these nodes in subsequent operations. The [get-nodes] slot is useful for obtaining a collection of nodes based on a specified path or condition, enabling further processing or evaluation within the Hyperlambda execution context.
