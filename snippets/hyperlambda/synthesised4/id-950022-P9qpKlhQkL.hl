// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [remove-nodes] slot to delete specific nodes in a Hyperlambda structure. In this example, the [remove-nodes] slot targets all children nodes of the [signal] node, effectively removing them from the structure. This operation is useful for cleaning up or resetting parts of a node hierarchy by specifying the path of nodes to be removed.
