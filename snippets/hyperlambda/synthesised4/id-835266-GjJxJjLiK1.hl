// This Hyperlambda code uses the [math.increment] slot to increase the value of the node referenced by the expression `@.similar` by 1. The [math.increment] slot modifies the value in place, meaning it directly changes the value of the node it points to without needing to use [set-value]. If no step value is provided, the default increment is by 1.
math.increment:x:@.similar
