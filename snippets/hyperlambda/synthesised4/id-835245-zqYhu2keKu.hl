// The code snippet demonstrates how to add a [stream] node with a boolean value of true to the [payload] node within an [http.post] invocation. This is achieved by using the [add] slot, which targets the specific path of the [payload] node within the structure, ensuring that the [stream] node is added as a child to it. This can be useful for controlling the streaming behavior of the payload in HTTP POST requests.
