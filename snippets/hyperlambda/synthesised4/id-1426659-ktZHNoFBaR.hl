// The provided Hyperlambda code checks if the string value of the first node in a specified node set does not start with "https://". It uses the [not] slot to logically invert the result of the [strings.starts-with] slot, which evaluates whether the string begins with "https://". If it does not, the [not] slot will return true. The expression in [strings.starts-with] uses a lambda expression to navigate to the node whose value is being checked.
