// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" that is a sibling or a child of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it should find the first occurrence of a node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to directly access a specific node by name within the current context or hierarchy. In this case, it is looking for a node named "sql" that is in the same level or below the current node in the hierarchy.
