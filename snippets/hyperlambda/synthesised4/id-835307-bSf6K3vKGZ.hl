// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] block to define specific conditions that, when matched, execute the associated lambda object. In this example, the [case] slot is used with a character value, allowing the [switch] block to evaluate and execute the appropriate [case] based on the character input. This facilitates branching logic similar to switch/case constructs in traditional programming languages.
