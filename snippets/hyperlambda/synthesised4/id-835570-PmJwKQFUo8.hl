// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specific location in a node structure. It adds the nodes obtained from the [get-nodes] slot, which retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node, to the path specified by the [add] slot's expression. The [add] slot is used to modify the node structure by appending new nodes at the specified location. The [get-nodes] slot is used to fetch nodes from a given path, in this case, from the [.arguments] node.
