// 1. `@.reset-email`: This iterator searches for the first node named "reset-email" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy to find the node. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is located higher up in the node structure, such as retrieving a configuration or a value that is defined at a higher level in the hierarchy.
