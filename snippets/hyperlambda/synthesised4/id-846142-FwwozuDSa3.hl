/*
 * This Hyperlambda code adds a new node to the [.snippets] node. It creates a nested structure where the first child node is unnamed and contains two children: [prompt] and [completion]. The [prompt] node's value is set to the value of the [.prompt] node, and the [completion] node's value is set to the value of the [.completion] node. This structure is useful for organizing data into a specific format, possibly for templating or data storage purposes. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node to the [.snippets] node.
 * 2. [.] - Creates an unnamed node as a child of the node being added.
 * 3. [prompt] - Sets its value to the value of the [.prompt] node.
 * 4. [completion] - Sets its value to the value of the [.completion] node.
