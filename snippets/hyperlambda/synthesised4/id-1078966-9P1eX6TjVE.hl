/*
 * 1. `@.imported` - This iterator searches for the first node named "imported" within the current context. It starts from the current node and looks for a sibling or ancestor node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate data associated with a specific node named "imported" within a given scope. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: You might use this expression to check if a particular "imported" node exists in the current context, which could be part of a process to verify if certain data has been successfully imported or initialized.
