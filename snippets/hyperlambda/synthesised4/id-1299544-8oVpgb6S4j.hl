// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to query a database table named "Lightsaber" to retrieve records based on a specific condition, and then yield the results. The [data.read] slot is used to perform the database query, specifying the "Lightsaber" table. The [where] clause is employed to filter records where the "JediId" column matches the value of the "JediId" node found in the current data context, using an expression to reference this value. Finally, the [yield] slot is used to return the retrieved records, which are all the children nodes of the [data.read] result, under the node name "lightsabers". This structure is useful for dynamically fetching and returning data based on context-specific criteria, such as retrieving all lightsabers associated with a particular Jedi.
data.read
   table:Lightsaber
   where
      and
         JediId.eq:x:@.dp/#/*/JediId
yield
   lightsabers:x:@data.read/*
