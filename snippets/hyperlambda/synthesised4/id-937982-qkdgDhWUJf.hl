// This Hyperlambda code concatenates the current value of the [.result] node with the value of the node referenced by [.dp], adding a comma and space between them, and then sets this concatenated string as the new value of the [.result] node. The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine these values, and [set-value] updates the [.result] node with the concatenated string.
