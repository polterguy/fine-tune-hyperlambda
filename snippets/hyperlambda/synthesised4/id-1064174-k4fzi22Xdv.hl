/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing the root arguments node in a Hyperlambda file or endpoint, which typically contains input parameters or configuration settings.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node set. In this context, it is used to access all child nodes of the "arguments" node, which may include various input parameters.
 * 
 * 3. `group_column` - This iterator filters the previously selected node set to include only nodes with the name "group_column". It is used to specifically target a parameter or configuration setting named "group_column" within the arguments, allowing the Hyperlambda code to work with its value or further process it.
