// This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to read data from a database table named "Album" and filter the results based on a specific condition. The [data.read] slot is used to initiate the reading process from the "Album" table. Within the [where] clause, an [and] condition is specified to filter the records where the "ArtistId" column is equal to a dynamically retrieved value. This value is obtained from the expression `x:@.dp/#/*/ArtistId`, which likely points to a node containing the desired "ArtistId" value. Finally, the [yield] slot is used to return the filtered results, assigning them to a node named "albums". This setup is useful for dynamically filtering albums based on an artist's ID, potentially allowing for integration with other parts of a larger application where the artist ID is determined at runtime.
