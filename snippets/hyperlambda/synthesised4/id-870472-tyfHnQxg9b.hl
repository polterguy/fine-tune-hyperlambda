// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-name] slot to change the name of all nodes within the [hyper2lambda] node structure that are named [data.create] to [mysql.create]. The [set-name] slot takes a lambda expression to identify the target nodes and a single source node to specify the new name.
set-name:x:@hyper2lambda/**/data.create
   .:mysql.create
