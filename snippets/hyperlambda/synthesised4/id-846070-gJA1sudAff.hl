// This Hyperlambda code snippet modifies the value of the [.completion] node by replacing occurrences of the string " ," with ",". It uses the [set-value] slot to update the node's value and the [strings.replace] slot to perform the string replacement operation. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the substring to look for, and the second is the substring to replace it with.
