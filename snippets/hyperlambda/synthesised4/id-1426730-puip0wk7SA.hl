/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to add a new node to the [.sitemap] node. The new node is created with a child node that uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a string within another string. The [add] slot is used to dynamically modify the structure of the Hyperlambda graph by adding new nodes or modifying existing ones. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node to the [.sitemap] node.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the new node being added.
 * 3. [.:x:@strings.replace] - Uses the [strings.replace] slot to perform a string replacement operation within the newly added node.
