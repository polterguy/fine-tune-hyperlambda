/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the HTTP POST response status code is between 200 and 299, indicating a successful request. If true, it retrieves the "name" and "user-id" from the response content and assigns them to local nodes [.name] and [.user-id] respectively. The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, [and] ensures both conditions are true, [mte] and [lt] perform the status code checks, and [set-value] assigns the retrieved values. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Begins a conditional block.
 * 2. [and] - Ensures both conditions must be true.
 * 3. [mte] - Checks if the status code is more than or equal to 200.
 * 4. [lt] - Checks if the status code is less than 300.
 * 5. [.lambda] - Executes if the condition is true.
 * 6. [.name] - Declares a node for storing the name.
 * 7. [set-value] - Assigns the name from the response content.
 * 8. [.user-id] - Declares a node for storing the user ID.
 * 9. [set-value] - Assigns the user ID from the response content.
