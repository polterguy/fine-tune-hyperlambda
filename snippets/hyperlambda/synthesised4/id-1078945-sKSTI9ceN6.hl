/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to access the [.arguments] node, which is typically used in Hyperlambda to define the arguments passed to a function or a slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all the children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument node defined within the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `type` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "type". It is used to specifically access the "type" node within each argument node, which might define the data type or category of the argument.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function or slot to validate or process the types of arguments passed to it. For example, it could be used to ensure that all required arguments have a specific type before proceeding with further processing.
 * - It could also be used in a logging or debugging context to output or verify the types of arguments received by a function or endpoint.
