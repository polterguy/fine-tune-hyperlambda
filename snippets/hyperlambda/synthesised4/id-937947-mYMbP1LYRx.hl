// The [data.delete] slot is used to delete records from a specified table in a database, with an optional [where] clause to filter which records to delete. The [database-type] specifies the type of database, in this case, SQLite. The [where] clause uses logical conditions to specify criteria for deletion, ensuring only records that meet the conditions are removed.
