 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [get-count] slot to count the number of child nodes under the [.snippets] node. The [get-count] slot takes an expression as its argument, which specifies the nodes to be counted. In this example, the expression "@.snippets/*" points to all direct children of the [.snippets] node, and [get-count] returns the total number of these children nodes.
 * // 1. [get-count] - Counts the number of nodes specified by the expression "@.snippets/*", which refers to all direct children of the [.snippets] node.
