// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specific location in a node structure. The [add] slot is used to add nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] from the [.arguments] node to the children of the [where] node within a [data.read] operation. The [get-nodes] slot fetches all child nodes of [.arguments], which are then added to the specified location.
add:x:./*/data.read/*/where/*
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*
