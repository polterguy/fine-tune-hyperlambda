// The Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and retrieve the content from a deeply nested node structure. The expression "x:+/*/*/*/content" navigates through the node hierarchy to find the "content" node, and the [unwrap] slot ensures that this node's value is evaluated and returned before the execution reaches the node where the [unwrap] is referenced.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*/content
