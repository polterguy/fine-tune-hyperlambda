/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda to add a node with a boolean value to a temporary node collection. If none of the preceding conditional branches (like [if] or [else-if]) evaluate to true, the [else] block is executed, adding a node named [automatic] with a value of false to the children of the [.tmp] node.
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes the block of code if none of the preceding conditional branches are true.
 * 2. [add:x:@.tmp/*] - Adds nodes to the children of the [.tmp] node.
 * 3. [automatic:bool:false] - A node added to [.tmp] with the name [automatic] and a boolean value of false.
