/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [case] slot within a [switch] statement to execute different code blocks based on the value of a specified node. The [switch] slot evaluates the value of its expression and matches it against the values of its [case] children. When a match is found, the corresponding [case] block is executed. If no match is found, the [default] block is executed. This structure allows for clear and organized conditional branching in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Evaluates the value of its expression to determine which [case] block to execute.
 * 2. [case] - Represents a possible value to match against the [switch] expression. If the [switch] expression matches this value, the code within this block is executed.
 * 3. [default] - Executed if no [case] value matches the [switch] expression.
