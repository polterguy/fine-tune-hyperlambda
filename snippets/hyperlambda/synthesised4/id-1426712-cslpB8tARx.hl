// The code converts the result of an HTTP POST request into a Hyperlambda representation. It uses the [lambda2hyper] slot to transform the node structure of the HTTP POST request result, referenced by the expression [@http.post], into a Hyperlambda format. This allows for easier manipulation and inspection of the HTTP response within a Hyperlambda environment.
