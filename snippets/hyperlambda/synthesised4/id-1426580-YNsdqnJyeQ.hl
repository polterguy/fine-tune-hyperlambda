/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet iterates over all files returned by a recursive file listing operation, checks if each file ends with the ".hl" extension, and if so, executes the file as a Hyperlambda script. After executing the file, it logs a success message to the console indicating that the Hyperlambda file was successfully executed. The code uses a combination of [for-each] to iterate over files, [if] to check file extensions, [io.file.execute] to execute the Hyperlambda files, and [strings.concat] and [console.log] to create and display the success message.
 * 
 * 1. [for-each] - Iterates over each file returned by the recursive file listing.
 * 2. [if] - Checks if the current file ends with the ".hl" extension.
 * 3. [strings.ends-with] - Determines if the file name ends with ".hl".
 * 4. [io.file.execute] - Executes the Hyperlambda file.
 * 5. [strings.concat] - Concatenates strings to form a success message.
 * 6. [console.log] - Logs the success message to the console.
