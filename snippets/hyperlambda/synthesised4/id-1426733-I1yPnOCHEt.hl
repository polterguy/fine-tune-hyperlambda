/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a specific data type exists in the data read from a source. If the data type does not exist, it throws an exception with a message indicating that the machine learning type does not exist, including the type that was expected. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks a condition and executes its child nodes if the condition is true.
 * 2. [not-exists] - Evaluates whether a specified node set does not exist.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the code to be executed if the condition is true.
 * 4. [throw] - Throws an exception with a specified message.
 * 5. [type] - Retrieves the type from the arguments to include in the exception message.
