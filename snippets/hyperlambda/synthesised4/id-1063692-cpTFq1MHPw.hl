// 1. `@.public-key-filename`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "public-key-filename" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with this specific name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name within the current scope or its ancestors, ensuring that you retrieve the correct node even if there are multiple nodes with the same name at different levels of the hierarchy.
