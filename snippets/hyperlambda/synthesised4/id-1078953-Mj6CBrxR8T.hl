/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (the next node below) of its previous result set. It starts from the current node and moves to the next sibling node in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access nodes that are at the same level but are declared after the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all nodes that are directly under the current node. This is beneficial when you need to process or evaluate all child nodes of a particular parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `args` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "args". It is used to specifically target nodes named "args" among the children nodes. This is useful when you are looking for argument nodes within a structure.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Similar to the previous `*`, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used here to access all nodes that are directly under the "args" node. This allows you to evaluate or manipulate all argument nodes within "args".
 * 
 * 5. `message` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "message". It is used to specifically target nodes named "message" among the children of "args". This is useful when you need to extract or manipulate message nodes within the arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to extract or process message nodes from a set of arguments that are located as elder siblings to the current context. For example, it could be used in a logging or messaging system to retrieve specific message details from a structured data set.
