// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [return-nodes] slot in Hyperlambda. It returns a set of nodes, each representing a programming language, from a dynamically created slot or a context that supports returning nodes. The [return-nodes] slot is used to output multiple nodes, in this case, listing "Python", "JavaScript", and "Go" as child nodes under [languages].
