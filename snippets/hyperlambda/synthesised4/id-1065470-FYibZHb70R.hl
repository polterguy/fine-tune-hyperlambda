// 1. `@.no`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node itself. It will return the first match it finds. This is useful when you need to access a specific ancestor node or the current node itself by name, and you are unsure of its exact position in the hierarchy.
