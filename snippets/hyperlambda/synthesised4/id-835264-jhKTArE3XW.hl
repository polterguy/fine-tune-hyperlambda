// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specific destination. It retrieves nodes using the [get-nodes] slot from the [.return] node and appends them to the children of the [urls] node within the [return-nodes] context. This operation effectively combines nodes from different parts of the Hyperlambda graph into a single location.
add:x:./*/return-nodes/*/urls
   get-nodes:x:@.return/*
