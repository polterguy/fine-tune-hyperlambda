/*
 * 1. `@.dp`: This iterator retrieves the first node named `.dp` from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and `.dp` suggests it is a data node, possibly used to store some temporary or dynamic data in the current execution context.
 * 
 * 2. `#`: This iterator de-references the value of the `.dp` node. It assumes that the value of the `.dp` node is itself another node, and this iterator retrieves that node by reference. This is useful when you want to manipulate or access the original node rather than a copy of it.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous result set. In this context, it is used to access all children of the node that was de-referenced by the `#` iterator.
 * 
 * 4. `url`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `url`. It is used to specifically target nodes that are intended to store or represent URLs within the children of the de-referenced node. This is useful for operations that need to be performed on URL nodes, such as validation, transformation, or extraction.
