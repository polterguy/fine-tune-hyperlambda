// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to handle various data types and convert them accordingly. It uses [get-name] to retrieve the name of the current node, and [switch] to determine the type of conversion needed based on the node's type. The [case] slots handle numeric types by converting them using [convert], while the [hyperlambda] type is processed using [hyper2lambda] with comments enabled. The [set-value] slot updates the node's value after conversion.
