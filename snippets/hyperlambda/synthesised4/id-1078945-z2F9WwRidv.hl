/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing the arguments passed to a function or a slot, typically used in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints to access input parameters.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access all the parameters or arguments provided to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `stream` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "stream" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is useful for accessing a specific argument or parameter named "stream" that might be passed to a function or slot.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a dynamic slot or HTTP endpoint to access a parameter named "stream" that is passed as part of the input arguments, allowing the slot to perform operations specifically on this parameter.
