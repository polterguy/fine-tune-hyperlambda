/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it looks for a node by name, and the dot before `arguments` specifies that it is a direct child or sibling in the hierarchy. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. The asterisk symbol is used to access all direct children, regardless of their names. This is useful when you want to iterate over or access all argument nodes provided to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `/direction` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [direction]. It is used to specifically access the [direction] argument within the [.arguments] node. This is helpful when you need to perform operations or checks on a specific argument named [direction].
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used in a function or slot to determine the value of a [direction] argument passed to it, allowing the function to perform different operations based on the direction specified (e.g., "left", "right", "up", "down").
 * - It can be used in a validation routine to ensure that a required [direction] argument is present and has a valid value before proceeding with further logic.
