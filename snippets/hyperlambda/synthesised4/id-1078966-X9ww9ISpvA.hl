/*
 * 1. `@data.read`: This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context with the name "data.read". It is used to locate the starting point for further navigation within the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `0`: This iterator selects the first child of the "data.read" node. It is useful when you want to access a specific child node by its index position, in this case, the very first child.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the previously selected node (the first child of "data.read"). It allows you to access all nodes directly underneath the selected node.
 * 
 * 4. `id`: This iterator filters the nodes obtained from the previous step to only include those with the name "id". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes specifically named "id".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the "id" of the first record or entry in a data set read from a source, such as a database or a file.
 * - Accessing a unique identifier for the first item in a collection of data, which could be useful for operations like updating or deleting a specific entry.
