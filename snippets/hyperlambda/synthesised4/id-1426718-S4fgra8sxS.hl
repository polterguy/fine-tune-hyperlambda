 * The code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.content] node to the content of a file. It does this by loading the file specified by the [.dp] node's value, which is passed by reference, using the [io.file.load] slot. This effectively assigns the content of the file to the [.content] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.content] node.
 * 2. [io.file.load] - Loads the content of the file specified by the [.dp] node's value.
