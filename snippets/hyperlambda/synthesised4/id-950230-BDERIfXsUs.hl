// This Hyperlambda code uses a [switch] statement to handle different HTTP response status codes from a [http.post] request. Each [case] node corresponds to a specific status code, performing actions like setting a feedback status message with [set-value] or throwing an exception with [throw] for error codes. The [default] node handles any unrecognized status codes by setting a generic feedback message.
