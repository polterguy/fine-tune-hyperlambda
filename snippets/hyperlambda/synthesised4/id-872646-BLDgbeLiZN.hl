// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a SQL read operation on a SQLite database, specifically joining the "Treatments" table with the "Patients" table using a left join on the "PatientID" field. It selects specific columns from both tables, including "TreatmentID", "PatientID", "TreatmentDate", and "Description" from the "Treatments" table, and "FirstName" from the "Patients" table, with an alias applied to the latter. The code structure allows for additional conditions to be specified under the [where] clause.
