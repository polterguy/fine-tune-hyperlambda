// The code demonstrates the use of the [fork] slot to execute a lambda object in a separate thread. It uses [eval] to execute the lambda object referenced by [invoke], allowing for concurrent execution without blocking the main thread. This approach is useful for parallel processing or executing non-blocking tasks.
