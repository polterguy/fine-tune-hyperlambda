// The code snippet uses [strings.concat] to concatenate a series of strings, with each string being a value retrieved from a node path specified by a [get-value] expression. The [get-value] expression iterates over nodes using [for-each], accessing the [.dp] node by reference, and retrieves the [path] node's value for each iteration. The concatenated result is a single string composed of these path values, separated by a forward slash "/".
