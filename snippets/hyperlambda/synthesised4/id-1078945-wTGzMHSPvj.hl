/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator starts at the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate upwards in the hierarchy, moving from the current node to its direct parent.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children of the parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `.invoke` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name `.invoke`. It is used to find specific nodes named `.invoke` among the children of the parent node.
 * 
 * 4. `0` - This iterator retrieves the first child node of its previous result set. In this context, it selects the first `.invoke` node found among the children of the parent node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to find and operate on the first `.invoke` node within a specific context, such as executing or modifying it.
 * - It might be useful in scenarios where you need to ensure a particular operation is applied to the first invocation node within a set of operations.
