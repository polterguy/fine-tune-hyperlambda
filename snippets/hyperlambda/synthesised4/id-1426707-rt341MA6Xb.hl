 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [get-count] slot to return the number of child nodes under the [.file-data] node. It effectively counts how many nodes exist directly beneath the [.file-data] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [get-count] - Returns the number of nodes its expression is pointing to, in this case, the children of [.file-data].
