// The Hyperlambda code uses the [set-name] slot to change the names of all nodes referenced by its expression to the value obtained from the [get-value] slot. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [databaseType] node within the [.arguments] node. This effectively renames the nodes to the specified database type.
