/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [arguments] in the current context. It is used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot, typically found at the beginning of a Hyperlambda graph to define input parameters.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [arguments] node. It is used to access each individual argument that has been passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [session]. It is used to specifically access the [session] argument from the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to access a session-related argument, which might contain information about the current user session, such as session ID, user data, or authentication tokens.
 * - It can be used in an HTTP endpoint to retrieve session data passed as part of the request, allowing the endpoint to perform operations based on the user's session state.
