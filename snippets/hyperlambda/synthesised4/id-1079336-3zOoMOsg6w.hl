// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for the node with the specified name. The `.` before `sql` suggests that it will look for this node within the current hierarchy or scope. This expression is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate the "sql" node, which might contain SQL queries or related data, within the current context. A potential use case could be dynamically executing or modifying SQL queries stored in the "sql" node.
