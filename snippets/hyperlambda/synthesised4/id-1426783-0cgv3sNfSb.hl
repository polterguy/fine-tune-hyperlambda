// This Hyperlambda code retrieves all child nodes of the [snippets] node, which is a child of the [signal] node. The [get-nodes] slot is used to access these nodes, allowing further manipulation or processing of the retrieved node set. The expression [@signal/*/snippets/*] specifies the path to the desired nodes, starting from the [signal] node, traversing through its children, and reaching the [snippets] node's children.
