/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the hierarchy of nodes.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all nodes directly under the parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "signal". It is used to narrow down the search to specific nodes named "signal".
 * 
 * 4. `=magic.ai.crawl-site` - This iterator retrieves nodes from the previous result set that have a value equal to "magic.ai.crawl-site". It is used to find nodes with a specific value.
 * 
 * 5. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all nodes directly under the nodes with the specified value.
 * 
 * 6. `.onafter` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name ".onafter". It is used to narrow down the search to specific nodes named ".onafter".
 * 
 * 7. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all nodes directly under the ".onafter" nodes.
 * 
 * 8. `.type` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name ".type". It is used to narrow down the search to specific nodes named ".type".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to navigate a complex node structure to find and retrieve specific configuration or metadata related to a "magic.ai.crawl-site" signal, particularly focusing on the type of an event or action that occurs after a certain process. It could be useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically adjust behavior based on the type of a signal after a crawling operation.
