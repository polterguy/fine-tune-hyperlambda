// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a destination node. It targets the [.ip-addresses] node and adds a new node with a value derived from the [.dp] node, which is typically used in a loop or iteration context to reference the current node being processed. This allows dynamic addition of nodes based on the current context or iteration state.
