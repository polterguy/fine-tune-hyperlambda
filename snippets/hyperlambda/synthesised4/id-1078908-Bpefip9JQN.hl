/*
 * 1. `@.max-tokens`: This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which means it will search for the first node with the name "max-tokens" in the current context. The `.` indicates that the search is limited to the current node's children and does not traverse siblings or ancestors. This expression is used to directly access a node named "max-tokens" that is a child of the current node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a configuration value for the maximum number of tokens allowed in a process, such as when setting limits for a text generation task.
 * - Accessing a parameter in a machine learning or natural language processing context where token limits are relevant.
