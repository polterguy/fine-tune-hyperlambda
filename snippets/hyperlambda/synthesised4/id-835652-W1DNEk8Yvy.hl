// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a SQL read operation on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "activities" table. It includes a left join with the "clients" table using the "client_id" as an alias. The code specifies an aggregate function to be applied to the columns, with the result being aliased as "result". A "where" clause is included, although no specific conditions are defined, and the query limits the results to one record. The [database-type] slot specifies the database type, [table] indicates the table to query, [join] defines the join operation, [columns] lists the columns to select, [where] sets conditions, and [limit] restricts the number of returned records.
