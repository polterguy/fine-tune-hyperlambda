// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using a left join between the "EmployeeTerritories" and "Employees" tables in a SQLite database. It specifies the columns to be selected, including an aggregate function with an alias "result". The query includes a "where" clause and limits the result to one record. Key slots include [data.read] for reading data, [join] for joining tables, [columns] for selecting columns, and [limit] for limiting the number of returned records.
data.read

      join:Employees
         as:EmployeeID
         type:left

            and
               EmployeeTerritories.EmployeeID:EmployeeID.EmployeeID
