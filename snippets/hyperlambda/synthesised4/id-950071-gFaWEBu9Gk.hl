// The code snippet demonstrates the use of conditional branching with [else] and [if] in Hyperlambda. It retrieves the name of the current node using [get-name], checks if it equals "wheel" with [eq], and sets the node's value to "urgent restock" if true. Otherwise, it defaults to setting the value to "restock".
