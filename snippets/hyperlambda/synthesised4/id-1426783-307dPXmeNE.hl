/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add a new node to an existing node set. It uses the [add] slot to append a new node to the [.session] node. The new node has a child node with a [.role] node set to "system" and a [.content] node whose value is dynamically retrieved from the [.new-prompt] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends a new node to the [.session] node.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the new node being added.
 * 3. [.] - Represents the child node of the new node.
 * 4. [role] - Sets the role of the new node to "system".
 * 5. [content] - Retrieves the value from the [.new-prompt] node to set as the content of the new node.
