// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a collection. It retrieves nodes specified by the expressions in [get-nodes] from the [.arguments] node, specifically the [limit] and [offset] nodes, and appends them to the children of the [data.read] node. This is useful for dynamically constructing a node structure based on input arguments.
add:x:./*/data.read
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/limit
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/offset
