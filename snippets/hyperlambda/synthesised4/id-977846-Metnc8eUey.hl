// This Hyperlambda code snippet updates the value of the [.total-score] node by adding the current value of [.base-score] to a static integer value of 25. The [set-value] slot is used to assign the result of the [math.add] operation to [.total-score], where [get-value] retrieves the current value of [.base-score] for the addition.
