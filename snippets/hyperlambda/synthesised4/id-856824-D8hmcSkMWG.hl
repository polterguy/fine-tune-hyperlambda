// The [case] slot is used within a [switch] block to define a specific condition or value to match against the evaluated expression of the [switch]. If the value of the [switch] matches the value of the [case], the associated lambda object is executed. In this context, the [case:money] slot would execute its children nodes if the evaluated value of the [switch] is "money".
