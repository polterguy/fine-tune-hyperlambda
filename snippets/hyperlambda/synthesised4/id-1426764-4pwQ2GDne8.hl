/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [case] slot to handle different scenarios based on the value of a small integer. The [case] slot is typically used in conjunction with [switch] to execute different code blocks depending on the value of a given expression. In this example, the [case] slot is used to match a specific small integer value and execute the corresponding code block. The [smallint] type indicates that the value being compared is a small integer, which is typically used to represent smaller numeric values efficiently.
 * 
 * 1. [case] - This slot is used to define a specific case or scenario to handle based on a given value.
 * 2. [smallint] - This type indicates that the value being compared is a small integer, which is a numeric type used for smaller values.
