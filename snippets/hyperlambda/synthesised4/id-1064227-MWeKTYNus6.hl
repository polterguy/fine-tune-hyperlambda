/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which is crucial for retrieving input parameters in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument passed into the dynamic slot or endpoint, allowing for further filtering or processing of these nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `distinct_column` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `distinct_column`. It is used to specifically target and retrieve the node that holds the value or configuration related to the `distinct_column` argument, which might be used for operations like ensuring uniqueness in a dataset or specifying a column for distinct operations in data processing.
