/*
 * 1. `@.model`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "model" that is at the same level or higher in the hierarchy relative to the current node. It starts searching from the current node's position and moves upwards through its ancestors until it finds a match. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access configuration or settings stored in a "model" node that is shared across different parts of a Hyperlambda script.
 * - It can be used to retrieve data or parameters that are defined at a higher level in the hierarchy, ensuring that the correct context or configuration is applied to subsequent operations.
