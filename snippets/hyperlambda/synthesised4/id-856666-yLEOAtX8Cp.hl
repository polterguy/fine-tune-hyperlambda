/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks two conditions using the [and] slot. It first verifies if a node named "order" exists within the [.arguments] node using the [exists] slot. Then, it checks if the value of the "order" node is equal to "tokens" using the [eq] slot. The [and] slot ensures that both conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Ensures both conditions must be true.
 * 2. [exists] - Checks if the "order" node exists within [.arguments].
 * 3. [eq] - Compares the value of "order" to "tokens".
