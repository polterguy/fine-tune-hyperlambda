// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [return-nodes] slot to return a set of nodes from a dynamically created slot. It includes two nodes: [message], which concatenates strings using [strings.concat], and [five-years-from-now-you-are], which adds values using [math.add]. This structure allows for the dynamic generation and return of calculated or concatenated results.
