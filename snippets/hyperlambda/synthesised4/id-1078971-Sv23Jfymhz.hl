/*
 * 1. `@json2lambda` - This iterator looks for the first node with the name "json2lambda" in the current context. It's used to navigate to a specific part of the node structure, starting from the current node and moving upwards or laterally in the hierarchy until it finds the node named "json2lambda".
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "json2lambda" node. It allows for accessing any node directly beneath "json2lambda", regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `magic` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "magic" from the children nodes of "json2lambda". It ensures that only nodes with this specific name are considered in the next steps.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator again retrieves all children nodes of the "magic" node. It allows for accessing any node directly beneath "magic", regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 5. `databases` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "databases" from the children nodes of "magic". It ensures that only nodes with this specific name are considered in the next steps.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "databases" node. It allows for accessing any node directly beneath "databases", regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 7. `default` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "default" from the children nodes of "databases". It ensures that only nodes with this specific name are selected.
 * 
 * This expression is useful for navigating a hierarchical data structure, such as a configuration file or a JSON object, to find a specific "default" node within a nested structure of "json2lambda", "magic", and "databases". A potential use case could be retrieving default database connection settings from a configuration file.
