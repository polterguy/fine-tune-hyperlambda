// The [signal] slot is used to invoke a previously created dynamic slot. In this example, the [signal] slot is invoked with an expression pointing to a node, and the node's value is expected to be a reference to a dynamic slot. The [signal] slot will execute the dynamic slot referenced by the node's value. The [.dp] node is typically used in a [for-each] loop to refer to the currently iterated node, and the [#] iterator de-references the node's value, allowing it to be used as a dynamic slot reference.
