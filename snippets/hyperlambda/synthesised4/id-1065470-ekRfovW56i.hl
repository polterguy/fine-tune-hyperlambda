// 1. `@.no`: This iterator searches for the first node named ".no" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will traverse through the node's ancestors and siblings to locate the node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is not a direct child of the current node, allowing you to reference nodes that are higher up in the structure.
