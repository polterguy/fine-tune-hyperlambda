 * The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to manipulate node structures using the [unwrap] and [add] slots. The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions within its scope, ensuring that any expressions are resolved before further operations are performed. In this case, it targets nodes that are three levels deep from the current node, specifically focusing on nodes named [content]. This is crucial for ensuring that any dynamic content or expressions within these nodes are fully evaluated and resolved before they are used in subsequent operations.
 * 
 * Following the [unwrap] operation, the [add] slot is employed to append new nodes into the [.session] node. The [add] slot takes the evaluated content and adds it as a child node under [.session]. The new node structure includes a [role] node with a static value of "assistant" and a [content] node whose value is dynamically retrieved from the [result] node. This approach allows for the dynamic construction of node hierarchies based on evaluated expressions, making it useful for scenarios where content needs to be dynamically generated and structured, such as in chatbot responses or dynamic content generation systems.
