/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to modify the value of a node named [.sql] by concatenating its current value with additional strings and a value from a specific node. It uses [strings.concat] to append an opening parenthesis, the length of a node's children, and a closing parenthesis to the existing [.sql] value. The [set-value] slot is used to update the [.sql] node with this concatenated result. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the [.sql] node with the concatenated result.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings and values into a single string.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.sql] - Retrieves the current value of the [.sql] node.
 * 4. [.: (] - Adds an opening parenthesis to the concatenation.
 * 5. [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/length] - Retrieves the length of the children nodes of a specific node.
 * 6. [.: )] - Adds a closing parenthesis to the concatenation.
