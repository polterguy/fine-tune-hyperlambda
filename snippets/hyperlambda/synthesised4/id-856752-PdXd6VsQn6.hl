// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and return the type of each child node under the [tasks.create] node. The [unwrap] slot processes expressions, and in this case, it navigates through the node structure to extract the type information of each task creation node. The result will be the types of the nodes involved in creating tasks.
