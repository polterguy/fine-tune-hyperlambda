// The code snippet uses [set-value] to modify the value of a node referenced by the expression [@.dp/#/*/completion]. It employs [strings.trim] to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the content of a specific node path [@http.post/*/content/*/choices/0/*/message/*/content], with the whitespace characters specified in the [.:" "] node. This operation is useful for cleaning up text data received from an HTTP POST request before further processing or storage.
