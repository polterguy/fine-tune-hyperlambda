// This Hyperlambda code evaluates two conditions using the [and] slot to ensure both are true. The first condition checks if any nodes exist at the specified path using [exists], while the second condition verifies that at least one of these nodes has a non-null value using [not-null]. The [and] slot will only return true if both conditions are satisfied.
