/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a SQL read operation on an SQLite database, specifically targeting the "opportunities" table. It includes a left join with the "clients" table based on the client_id, and selects columns with an aggregate function, aliasing the result as "result". The query applies a "where" condition with logical "and" and limits the result to one record. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.read] - Initiates a read operation from the database.
 * 2. [database-type] - Specifies the database type as SQLite.
 * 3. [table] - Indicates the main table for the operation, "opportunities".
 * 4. [join] - Performs a left join with the "clients" table.
 * 5. [as] - Aliases the join condition with "client_id".
 * 6. [type] - Specifies the join type as "left".
 * 7. [on] - Defines the condition for the join.
 * 8. [and] - Combines multiple conditions for the join.
 * 9. [opportunities.client_id:client_id.client_id] - Specifies the join condition based on client_id.
 * 10. [columns] - Lists the columns to be selected.
 * 11. [aggregate_functor] - Placeholder for an aggregate function.
 * 12. [as] - Aliases the result of the aggregate function as "result".
 * 13. [where] - Begins a conditional clause.
 * 14. [and] - Logical operator for combining conditions.
 * 15. [limit] - Restricts the query to return only one record.
