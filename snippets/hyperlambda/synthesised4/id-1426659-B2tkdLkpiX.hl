/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to set the values of specific header nodes within a [page-header] node structure. It uses the [set-value] slot to assign values to [h4], [h5], and [h6] nodes. The value for the [h4] node is retrieved from a [prompt] node using [get-value], while the values for [h5] and [h6] are not explicitly set, implying they might be set to null or default values. This code is useful for dynamically updating header content in a structured node graph.
 * 
 * 1. [case] - This is a conditional branching slot, typically used within a [switch] statement to define a specific case.
 * 2. [set-value] - Changes the value of the specified nodes.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the specified node, in this case, the [prompt] node.
 * 4. [page-header] - This is the parent node containing header nodes [h4], [h5], and [h6].
 * 5. [h4], [h5], [h6] - These are child nodes of [page-header] whose values are being set or modified.
