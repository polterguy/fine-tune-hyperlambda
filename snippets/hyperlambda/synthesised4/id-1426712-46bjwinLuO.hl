// This Hyperlambda code uses the [validators.default] slot to ensure that the [.arguments] node contains a child node named [stream] with a boolean value. If the [stream] node does not exist, it will be created with a default value of false. If the [stream] node exists but has a null value, its value will be set to false. This ensures that the [stream] node is always present with a valid boolean value in the [.arguments] node.
