/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet trims whitespace characters, including spaces, tabs, and newlines, from the value of the [.anchor] node. It uses the [strings.trim] slot to remove these characters and then sets the trimmed result back to the [.anchor] node using the [set-value] slot.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.anchor] node to the result of the [strings.trim] operation.
 * 2. [strings.trim] - Trims whitespace characters from the value of the [.anchor] node.
 * 3. [.] - Specifies the whitespace characters to be trimmed, including spaces, tabs, and newlines.
