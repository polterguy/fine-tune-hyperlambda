// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced, effectively "unwrapping" the value. In this example, [unwrap] is used to evaluate nodes before they are accessed, allowing dynamic evaluation of expressions. The slot can also handle multiple nodes using the [apply-lists] argument, enabling the addition of all source nodes to the destination node.
