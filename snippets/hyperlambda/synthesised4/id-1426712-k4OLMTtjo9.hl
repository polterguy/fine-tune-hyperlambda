// The Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and retrieve the content from a deeply nested node structure. The expression `x:+/*/*/*/content` navigates through the hierarchy to access the desired node, and [unwrap] ensures that the evaluation occurs before reaching the node where it's referenced, effectively "unwrapping" the value for use.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*/content
