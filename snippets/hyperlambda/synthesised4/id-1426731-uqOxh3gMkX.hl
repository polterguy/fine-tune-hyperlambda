// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied with an expression that uses the "+" iterator followed by the "/**" wildcard, which indicates that it will forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied as a value to unwrap itself. This allows for dynamic evaluation of expressions, ensuring that any changes or updates to the referenced nodes are accounted for before the node is processed.
