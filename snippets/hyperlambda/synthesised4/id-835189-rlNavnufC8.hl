/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes into multiple destination nodes. It retrieves nodes using [get-nodes] from a reference node and adds them to all nodes named [return] located two levels up in the hierarchy. This process allows for the flexible addition of nodes into multiple parent nodes simultaneously. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to all [return] nodes located two levels up in the hierarchy.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the reference node [.dp/#] to be added.
