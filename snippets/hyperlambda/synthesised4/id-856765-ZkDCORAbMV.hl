/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [case] slot to define a case block for a switch statement. Inside the case block, it uses the [add] slot to add a new node to the [.model] node. The new node has a name of [model_size] and a value of 4096, indicating the size of the model in some context. The [add] slot is used to append this new node as a child to the [.model] node.
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Defines a case block for a switch statement.
 * 2. [add] - Adds a new node to the [.model] node.
 * 3. [.] - Represents the parent node for the new child node.
 * 4. [model_size] - The name of the new node being added.
 * 5. [int:4096] - The value and type of the new node, indicating the model size.
