/*
 * 1. `@.inventory`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "inventory" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It stops as soon as it finds such a node. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node that might be located at different levels of the hierarchy, ensuring you always get the first occurrence of "inventory" from the current context.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "inventory" node. It is used when you want to access or manipulate all items or elements contained within the "inventory" node. This is particularly useful in scenarios where "inventory" holds a collection of items or data entries, and you need to process or iterate over each one.
