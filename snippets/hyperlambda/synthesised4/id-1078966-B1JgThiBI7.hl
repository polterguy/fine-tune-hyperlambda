/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of its previous result set. It moves to the next node below the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate the node immediately following the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. After moving to the elder sibling with the `+` iterator, the `*` iterator will access all children of that sibling node. This is useful for operations that need to process or evaluate all child nodes of a specific node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to navigate from a current node to its next sibling and then access all children of that sibling. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to apply a function or operation to all children of a node that follows the current node in a sequence, such as processing a list of items that are grouped under a sibling node in a configuration or data structure.
