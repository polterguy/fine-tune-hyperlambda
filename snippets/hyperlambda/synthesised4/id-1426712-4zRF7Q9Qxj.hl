/*
 * The Hyperlambda code snippet dynamically adds nodes to a destination node [session]. It appends a new node with a child node [role] set to "user" and another child node [content] whose value is derived from the [completion] node within the currently iterated node, referenced by [.dp]. This is useful for dynamically constructing a session object with user roles and content based on existing node data.
 * 
 * 1. [add:x:@.session] - Specifies the destination node [session] where new nodes will be added.
 * 2. [.] - Represents a new node to be added as a child to the [session] node.
 * 3. [.] - Represents a child node of the newly added node.
 * 4. [role:user] - Sets the [role] node's value to "user".
 * 5. [content:x:@.dp/#/*/completion] - Sets the [content] node's value to the value of the [completion] node within the currently iterated node, referenced by [.dp].
