/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings, until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful for accessing the arguments passed to a function or a slot, as `.arguments` is a common convention for storing such data.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It allows you to access any data or parameters that are nested directly under the `.arguments` node. This is helpful when you need to process or evaluate multiple parameters or data points that are passed as children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `data` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `data` from the previous result set. It is used to specifically target and retrieve nodes that are intended to hold data, which can be useful in scenarios where you need to manipulate or evaluate specific data elements within a larger set of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function to extract and process specific data passed as an argument, such as when validating or transforming input data before further processing.
 * - It can also be used to dynamically access and manipulate data nodes within a larger configuration or data structure, allowing for flexible and reusable code patterns.
