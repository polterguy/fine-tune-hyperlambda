/*
 * This Hyperlambda code updates a record in the "ml_training_snippets" table. It sets the "prompt" field to "Common" for the record where the "id" field equals the "id" value retrieved from the first record of a previous data read operation. The "where" clause ensures that only the specific record with the matching "id" is updated. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.update] - Initiates the update operation on the specified table.
 * 2. [table] - Specifies the table "ml_training_snippets" to update.
 * 3. [values] - Contains the fields and their new values to be updated.
 * 4. [prompt] - Sets the "prompt" field to the value "Common".
 * 5. [where] - Specifies the condition for updating records.
 * 6. [and] - Combines multiple conditions for the update.
 * 7. [id.eq] - Compares the "id" field to a specific value.
 * 8. [x:@data.read/0/*/id] - Retrieves the "id" value from the first record of a previous data read operation.
