// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Employees" and its alias "ReportsTo". The join condition is specified using the [on] slot, which ensures that the "ReportsTo" column in the "Employees" table matches the "EmployeeID" in the "ReportsTo" alias. The [type] slot is used to specify the type of join, which in this case is a left join, meaning all records from the "Employees" table will be included, along with matching records from the "ReportsTo" alias. The [as] slot is used to alias the "Employees" table as "ReportsTo".
