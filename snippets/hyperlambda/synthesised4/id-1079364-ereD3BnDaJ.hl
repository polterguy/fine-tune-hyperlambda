/*
 * 1. `@.fields`: This iterator looks for the first node named "fields" in the current node's hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through its ancestors until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that may be located higher up in the hierarchy, such as retrieving configuration or metadata stored in a parent node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a nested structure and need to access a common configuration or set of fields defined at a higher level, ensuring that you are always referencing the correct node regardless of the current depth in the hierarchy.
