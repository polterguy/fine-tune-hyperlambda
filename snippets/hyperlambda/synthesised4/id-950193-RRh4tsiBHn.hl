// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of the string "definately" with "definitely" within the content of a file. The [io.file.load] slot is used to load the file's content, which is then processed by [strings.replace] to perform the substitution. The result is the corrected text with all instances of the misspelled word replaced.
strings.replace:x:@io.file.load
   .:definately
   .:definitely
