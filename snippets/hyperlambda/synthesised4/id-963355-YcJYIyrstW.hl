// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to select records from the "employees" table in a database. By specifying the [table] argument with the value "employees", it constructs a SQL query to retrieve data from this table. The [data.read] slot is part of a larger Hyperlambda framework that facilitates database operations by abstracting SQL query generation.
data.read
   table:employees
