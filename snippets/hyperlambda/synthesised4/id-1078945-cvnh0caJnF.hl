// 1. `@convert`: This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context that has the name "convert". It searches through the siblings and ancestors of the current node to find this node. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate a specific node named "convert" that might be located at various levels in the hierarchy, such as when you want to apply a conversion operation or retrieve conversion-related data in a Hyperlambda graph.
