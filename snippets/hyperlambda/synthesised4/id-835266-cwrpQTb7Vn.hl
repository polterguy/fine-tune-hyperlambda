// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [data.execute] slot to perform a SQL DELETE operation. It deletes rows from the "vss_ml_training_snippets" table where the row ID matches those selected from the "ml_training_snippets" table, based on the "type" and "uri" arguments provided. The arguments [@type] and [@url] are dynamically retrieved from the [.arguments] node.
data.execute:"\n   delete from vss_ml_training_snippets\n      where rowid in (select id as rowid from ml_training_snippets where type = @type and uri = @url)"
   @type:x:@.arguments/*/type
   @url:x:@.arguments/*/url
