/*
 * 1. `@.model` - This iterator searches for the first node named "model" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is useful for locating a specific node when you know its name but not its exact position relative to the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "model" node. It is useful when you want to access or manipulate all direct descendants of a particular node.
 * 
 * 3. `max_request_tokens` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "max_request_tokens" among the children of the "model" node. It is useful for pinpointing a specific child node by name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve the "max_request_tokens" configuration value from a model configuration node, which might be part of a larger settings or configuration structure in a Hyperlambda application.
 * - It could be used in a validation or logging operation to ensure that the maximum request tokens setting is correctly configured or to log its current value for debugging purposes.
