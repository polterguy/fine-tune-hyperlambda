/*
 * This Hyperlambda code reads a YAML file from a stream and converts it into a lambda object. It uses the [io.stream.read] slot to read the file stream, and then the [yaml2lambda] slot to convert the YAML content into a lambda object, which is added to the [file-data] node.
 * 
 * 1. [io.stream.read] - Reads the YAML file from the provided stream.
 * 2. [add] - Adds the converted lambda object to the [file-data] node.
 * 3. [yaml2lambda] - Converts the YAML content read from the stream into a lambda object.
