// This Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. It evaluates the expression targeting the current node's elder sibling's children and their children, effectively "unwrapping" the values of these nodes before the instruction pointer reaches the node. This allows for forward evaluation of expressions within the lambda object, ensuring that the values are pre-evaluated before execution.
