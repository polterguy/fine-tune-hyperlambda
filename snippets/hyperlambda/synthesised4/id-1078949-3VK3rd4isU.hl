// 1. `@.file`: This iterator searches for the first node named "file" within the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node itself, until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate a specific node named "file" in the current execution context, such as retrieving a file path or file-related metadata.
