// The code demonstrates the use of the [or] slot, which evaluates to true if any of its child conditions are true. It checks if either the value of the node referenced by [SOME_EXPRESSION] equals [SOME_VALUE] or the value of the node referenced by [SOME_OTHER_EXPRESSION] equals [SOME_OTHER_VALUE]. If either condition is true, the [or] slot will evaluate to true.
