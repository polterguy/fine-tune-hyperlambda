/*
 * The Hyperlambda code checks if the [html2markdown] node is either null or equal to an empty string. If either condition is true, it returns a lambda object containing [urls], [snippets], and [meta] nodes, with the [meta] node having a child node [main] set to an integer value of 0. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional check.
 * 2. [or] - Combines two conditions, evaluating to true if either condition is true.
 * 3. [null] - Checks if the [html2markdown] node is null.
 * 4. [eq] - Checks if the [html2markdown] node is equal to an empty string.
 * 5. [.lambda] - Contains the operations to execute if the condition is true.
 * 6. [return] - Returns a lambda object with specified nodes.
 * 7. [urls] - A node returned within the lambda object.
 * 8. [snippets] - Another node returned within the lambda object.
 * 9. [meta] - A node containing additional information.
 * 10. [main] - A child node of [meta] with an integer value of 0.
