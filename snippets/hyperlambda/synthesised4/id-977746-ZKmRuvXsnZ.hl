// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [lt] slot to compare the value of [.score] with 50. It returns true if the value of [.score] is less than 50. The [lt] slot is used for "less than" comparisons, taking two arguments: the first being the expression pointing to the node to compare, and the second being the static value to compare against.
lt:x:@.score
