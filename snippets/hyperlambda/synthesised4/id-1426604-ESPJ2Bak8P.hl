/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to manipulate a node structure by inserting new nodes after a specific node identified by its operationId. It first unwraps the node structure to access its elements, then uses the [insert-after] slot to add "consumes" and "produces" nodes after the "operationId" node. The "consumes" node retrieves its value from the existing node structure, while the "produces" node is set to "application/json". This is useful for modifying or extending existing node structures with additional metadata or configuration details.
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Initiates a case block for conditional logic.
 * 2. [unwrap] - Expands the node structure to access deeper elements.
 * 3. [insert-after] - Inserts new nodes after a specified node.
 * 4. [consumes] - Retrieves and inserts a value from the existing node structure.
 * 5. [produces] - Inserts a static value indicating the content type.
