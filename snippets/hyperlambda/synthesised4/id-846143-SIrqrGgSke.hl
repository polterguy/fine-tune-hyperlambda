// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [math.multiply] slot to multiply a static integer value of 1000. Additionally, it uses the [convert] slot to convert the value of a node to an integer type, ensuring type consistency for further operations. The [convert] slot is applied to a node referenced by its expression.
