/*
 * 1. `@.remaining`: This iterator searches for the first node named "remaining" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "remaining" node it encounters. 
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression can be used to retrieve a specific node named "remaining" that might contain important data or configuration settings relevant to the current context, such as remaining time, remaining budget, or any other "remaining" value that needs to be accessed from a higher level in the node hierarchy.
