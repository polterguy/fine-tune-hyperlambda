/*
 * 1. `@.sql` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it should start the search from the current node's position in the hierarchy. This expression is useful when you need to reference a specific node named "sql" that is nearby in the structure, such as when you want to execute or manipulate SQL-related data or commands stored in that node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving SQL query strings or database connection information stored in a node named "sql" for further processing or execution.
 * - Accessing configuration or metadata related to SQL operations that are stored in a node named "sql".
