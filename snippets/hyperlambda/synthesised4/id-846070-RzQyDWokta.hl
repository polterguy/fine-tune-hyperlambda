// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [mte] slot to compare the status code of an HTTP GET request with the integer 200. It checks if the status code returned by the [http.get] invocation is "more than or equal" to 200, indicating successful or informational HTTP responses. The [mte] slot evaluates the condition by retrieving the status code from the [http.get] result using a lambda expression.
