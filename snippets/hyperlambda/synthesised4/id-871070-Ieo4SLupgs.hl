// This Hyperlambda code executes a workflow action named "openai-query" using the [execute] slot. It specifies the filename of the workflow action and passes in several arguments, including the model name, maximum tokens, context, instruction, and query. The context is retrieved from a previously executed node, the instruction is loaded from a file, and the query is passed by reference. The workflow action is likely related to querying an OpenAI model.
