/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed into a function or a slot, typically at the beginning of a Hyperlambda file or a dynamically created slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument passed into the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `copyButton` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "copyButton". It is used to specifically target the "copyButton" argument within the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function or slot to access the value of a specific argument named "copyButton". This is useful in scenarios where the function or slot needs to perform operations based on the presence or value of this particular argument, such as copying data to a clipboard or triggering a copy-related action.
