/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet reads data from the "ml_training_snippets" table, selecting the "prompt" and "completion" columns. It filters the results where the "type" column matches the provided argument and the "pushed" column equals 0. The query retrieves all matching records without a limit on the number of results. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.read] - Initiates a read operation from a database table.
 * 2. [table] - Specifies the table name to read data from, in this case, "ml_training_snippets".
 * 3. [columns] - Lists the columns to be selected, here "prompt" and "completion".
 * 4. [where] - Begins a conditional clause to filter the results.
 * 5. [and] - Combines multiple conditions that must all be true.
 * 6. [type.eq] - Compares the "type" column to the provided argument value.
 * 7. [pushed.eq] - Ensures the "pushed" column equals 0.
 * 8. [limit] - Sets the number of records to return, with -1 indicating no limit.
