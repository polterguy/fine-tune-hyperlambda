/*
 * 1. `@.fixed`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "fixed" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node by name, and the `.` before "fixed" specifies that it should start the search from the current node's parent. This means it will look for a sibling node named "fixed" that is at the same level as the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve configuration or constant values stored in a node named "fixed" that is located at the same hierarchical level as the current node.
 * - It can be used to access a sibling node that contains fixed or static data needed for processing or validation within a Hyperlambda script.
