/*
 * 1. `@http.post` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "http.post". It is used to navigate to the node representing an HTTP POST request in the current Hyperlambda graph.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "http.post" node. It is used to access any nested nodes within the HTTP POST request node.
 * 
 * 3. `content` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes named "content". It is used to navigate to the node containing the content of the HTTP POST request.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "content" node. It is used to access any nested nodes within the content node.
 * 
 * 5. `error` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes named "error". It is used to navigate to the node containing error information within the content node.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "error" node. It is used to access any nested nodes within the error node.
 * 
 * 7. `message` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes named "message". It is used to retrieve the specific node containing the error message within the error node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract error messages from the response content of an HTTP POST request, which is useful for logging or displaying error information to users.
 * - It can be used in error handling routines to programmatically check for specific error messages and take appropriate actions based on the content of the message.
