// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node it references is executed. In this example, [unwrap] is applied with an expression pointing to the next sibling node, ensuring any expressions within the sibling node are evaluated and their values are resolved before the sibling node is processed. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions in a lambda object.
