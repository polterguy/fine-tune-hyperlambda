/*
 * - `@json2lambda`: This iterator searches for the first node named "json2lambda" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and looks for a node with this specific name.
 *   
 * - `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node found by the previous iterator. In this case, it retrieves all children of the "json2lambda" node.
 *   
 * - `done_reason`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "done_reason" among the children of the "json2lambda" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * 1. This expression could be used to extract the "done_reason" status from a JSON to Lambda conversion process, allowing the developer to check why a particular conversion was completed.
 * 2. It can be used in a logging or monitoring system to track the reasons for completion of various tasks or processes represented in a JSON structure.
