// This Hyperlambda code checks two conditions using the [and] slot. It first verifies that the [filename] node within the current [.dp] node is not null using [not-null]. Then, it checks if the file specified by the [filename] node exists using [io.file.exists]. Both conditions must be true for the [and] slot to evaluate to true.
