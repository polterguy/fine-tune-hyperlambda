// This Hyperlambda code checks if the username is "admin" and either the user is logged in or has a token. The [and] slot ensures both the username condition and one of the login conditions are met, while the [or] slot allows for flexibility in authentication by accepting either a logged-in status or a token presence. The [eq] slot compares the username to "admin", and the [get-value] slots retrieve the values for login status and token presence.
