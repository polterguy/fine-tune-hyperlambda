// This Hyperlambda code performs a database query on the "customers" table, retrieving all records without a limit. It selects only the "Name" and "City" columns and applies a filter condition based on the "country" argument passed to the lambda. The [data.read] slot is used to execute the query, and the [where] clause specifies the condition for filtering the results. The [limit] is set to -1, indicating no restriction on the number of records returned.
