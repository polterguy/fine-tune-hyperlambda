// The code snippet checks if the status of an HTTP GET request's content is "failed". If true, it logs an error message about the failure of an OpenAI model training, deletes a task using its ID, and sends a signal through sockets to notify users with a specific role about the failure. The notification includes an error message and specifies the type as "error".
