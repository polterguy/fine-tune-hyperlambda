/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "result" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name. The `.` before "result" implies that it starts the search from the current node's context, looking for a sibling or a child node named "result".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the value of a node named "result" after a computation or operation to check the outcome.
 * - Accessing a result node to perform further operations or validations on the data it contains.
