// This Hyperlambda code evaluates a condition using the [if] slot combined with [or] to check if either the [.status] or [.timeout] node has a truthy value. If either condition is true, it executes the [.lambda] block, which sets the value of the [.alert] node to "Package issue detected". The [or] slot ensures that the [.lambda] block is executed if at least one of the conditions is met.
