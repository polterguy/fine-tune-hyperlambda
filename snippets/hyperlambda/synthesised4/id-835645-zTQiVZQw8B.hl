// The Hyperlambda code reads data from the "Shippers" table in an SQLite database, selecting distinct values using a functor and aliasing the result as "count". It applies a "where" condition with an "and" logical operator, allowing for additional conditions to be specified. The [data.read] slot is used to construct and execute the SQL query, tailored for the SQLite database type.
