// The code demonstrates the use of the [if] slot to evaluate a condition using the [and] slot. The [and] slot checks if all its boolean arguments are true. If the condition is true, the [.lambda] block is executed, which uses [set-value] to change the value of the [.result] node to "OK". The [if] slot evaluates the condition and executes the [.lambda] block only if the condition is true.
