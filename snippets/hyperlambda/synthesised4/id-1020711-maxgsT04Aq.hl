/*
 * 1. `@.data` - This iterator searches for the first node named "data" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings, until it finds a node with the name "data". This is useful for targeting specific nodes in a complex structure where the exact path may vary.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator. In this context, it will get all child nodes of the "data" node. This is useful when you want to perform operations on or analyze all elements within a container node.
 * 
 * 3. `foo` - This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to only include nodes named "foo". It is used to narrow down the search to specific nodes of interest, allowing for precise manipulation or retrieval of data within a larger set.
