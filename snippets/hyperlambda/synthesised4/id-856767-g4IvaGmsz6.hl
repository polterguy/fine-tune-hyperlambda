// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. It sets the value of the [.tmp] node to the value retrieved from the [.context] node using [get-value], but only if all preceding [if] and [else-if] conditions evaluate to false. The [else] slot does not require a condition and directly executes its child nodes.
