/*
 * The expression `@cache.get` is a lambda expression in Hyperlambda. Let's break down the components:
 * 
 * 1. `@` - This is the name iterator. It retrieves the first node with the specified name that follows the `@` symbol. In this case, it looks for a node named `cache.get`.
 * 
 * The expression `@cache.get` is used to find the first occurrence of a node named `cache.get` in the current context. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the value or children of a specific node named `cache.get` within a Hyperlambda graph. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving cached data: If `cache.get` is a node that stores cached data, this expression can be used to access that data for further processing or validation.
 * - Checking cache status: You might use this expression to verify if a certain cache entry exists or to inspect its contents.
