/*
 * This Hyperlambda code concatenates a URL scheme, "://", and the request host into a single string. It uses [strings.concat] to combine the value retrieved from [.scheme] with the static string "://" and the host of the current request. The resulting string is a complete URL without the path or query parameters. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.concat] - Concatenates a list of strings into one string.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [.scheme] node.
 * 3. [request.host] - Retrieves the host of the current request.
