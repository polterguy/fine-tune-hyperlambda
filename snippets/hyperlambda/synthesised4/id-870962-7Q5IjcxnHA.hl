/*
 * The code demonstrates how to use the [context] slot in Hyperlambda to store and retrieve a value within a lambda execution. It sets a context named "foo" with a value "bar" and retrieves it using [get-context] to set the value of [.result]. This mechanism allows sharing data across different parts of a Hyperlambda snippet without passing it explicitly as arguments.
 * 
 * 1. [context] - Adds an object to the context stack with a specified name and value.
 * 2. [value] - Specifies the value to be stored in the context.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Defines the lambda block where the context is accessible.
 * 4. [set-value] - Sets the value of a node.
 * 5. [get-context] - Retrieves the value from the context stack by name.
