// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to query an "employees" table in a database, filtering results based on a specific employee ID. The [where] clause uses an [and] condition to ensure that only records with an [employee_id] matching the provided argument are selected. This setup allows for dynamic querying of employee records by ID.
data.read
   table:employees
   where
      and
         employee_id.eq:x:@.arguments/*/employee_id
