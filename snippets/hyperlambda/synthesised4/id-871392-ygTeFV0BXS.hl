// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using the [data.read] slot, targeting a SQLite database. It selects distinct values from the "Regions" table, using a placeholder "distinct_functor" for the column name, and assigns an alias to the result. The query includes a [where] clause with an [and] condition, allowing for further filtering of the results.
