// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] slot to evaluate multiple conditions, specifically checking if a key named "app_mode" is equal to a specified value using [eq]. The [and] slot ensures that all conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. The [key.eq] part implies a comparison operation on a key or field named "app_mode".
