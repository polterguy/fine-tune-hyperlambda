// The code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.response] node to the value retrieved from a sibling node using [get-value]. The [get-value] slot navigates to the [.foo] node, moves to its previous sibling, and then accesses a child node named [content] to obtain its value. This operation effectively transfers the content from one part of the node structure to another.
