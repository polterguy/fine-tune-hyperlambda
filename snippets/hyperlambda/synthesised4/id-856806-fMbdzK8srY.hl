// This Hyperlambda code snippet appends a string to an existing SQL string. It uses the [else] slot to execute its children nodes if previous conditions are false. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.sql] node by concatenating its current value with a comma and newline using [strings.concat]. The [get-value] slot retrieves the current value of [.sql] to be concatenated.
