// The code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. The [else] slot is executed when none of the preceding conditional slots like [if] or [else-if] evaluate to true. In this example, the [else] block sets the value of the [.prompt] node to the value retrieved from the [.only-prompt] node using [get-value]. This ensures a default action is performed when all other conditions fail.
else
   set-value:x:@.prompt
      get-value:x:@.only-prompt
