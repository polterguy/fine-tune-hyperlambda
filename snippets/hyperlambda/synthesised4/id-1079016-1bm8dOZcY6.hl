/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by finding the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node with the specified name, and since it is prefixed with a dot, it looks for a node named `.arguments` in the current hierarchy. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access the individual argument nodes that are children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `supervised`: This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes that have the name `supervised`. It is used to find a specific argument named `supervised` among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to access a specific argument named `supervised` that was passed to it. This might be useful in scenarios where the slot or function needs to perform operations based on the presence or value of this specific argument, such as configuring a process to run in supervised mode.
