// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [.url] node contains the "#" character. The [strings.contains] slot is used to determine if a specific sequence of characters is present within a string. The expression [x:@.url] retrieves the value of the [.url] node, and the child node [.] specifies the character to search for.
