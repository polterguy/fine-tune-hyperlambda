// The code snippet uses the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] to a specific location within a node structure. The [get-nodes] slot fetches all nodes under [.arguments], and these nodes are then added to the path specified in the [add] slot's expression. This allows for dynamic modification of the node structure by incorporating nodes from the [.arguments] section.
