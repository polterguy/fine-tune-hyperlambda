// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to select specific columns from a database table. It specifies the table name as "logins" and selects the "username" and "login_time" columns. This allows for retrieving only the necessary data from the "logins" table, optimizing query performance by limiting the data returned.
data.read
   table:logins
