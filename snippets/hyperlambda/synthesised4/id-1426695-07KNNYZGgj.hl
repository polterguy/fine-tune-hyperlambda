/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet appends a specific string and the value of a node to the current value of the [.tmp] node. It uses the [set-value] slot to modify the [.tmp] node by concatenating its current value with two newline characters and the value obtained from a specific node path. The [strings.concat] slot is used to perform the concatenation operation. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Modifies the value of the [.tmp] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.tmp] - Retrieves the current value of the [.tmp] node.
 * 4. [.:@"\n"] - Represents a newline character to be added to the string.
 * 5. [get-value:x:@signal/*/snippets/0/*/prompt] - Retrieves the value from a specific node path to be concatenated.
