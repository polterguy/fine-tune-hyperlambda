 * 1. The first iterator, +, retrieves the next sibling node (the node directly below the current node at the same indentation level).
 * 2. The second iterator, *, retrieves all children of that next sibling node.
 * 3. The third iterator, *, retrieves all children of each of those child nodes.
 * 
 * The overall effect is to return all grandchildren (second-level descendants) of the next sibling node of the current node.
