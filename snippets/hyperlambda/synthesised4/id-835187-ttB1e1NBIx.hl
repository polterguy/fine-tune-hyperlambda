// This Hyperlambda code uses the [set-value] slot to modify the value of the [.anchor] node by trimming whitespace characters from its beginning and end. The [strings.trim] slot is used to perform the trimming operation, and it specifies a set of characters to trim, including spaces, tabs, and newline characters. The result is that [.anchor] will have its value updated to a version without leading or trailing whitespace.
