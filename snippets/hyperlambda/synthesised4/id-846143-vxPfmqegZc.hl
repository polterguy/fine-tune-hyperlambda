// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to append a node to the [.disallow] node. It uses an expression to reference the [strings.concat] slot, effectively adding it as a child node under [.disallow]. This allows for dynamic modification of the node structure by appending new nodes based on expressions.
add:x:@.disallow
   .
      .:x:@strings.concat
