// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [data.select] slot to execute a SQL query that retrieves the maximum completion value for each unique prompt from the "ml_requests" table, filtered by a specific user ID, and where the questionnaire and context are both set to 1. The results are grouped by the prompt field. The [user_id] is dynamically provided from the [.arguments] node.
data.select:"\nselect prompt, max(completion) as completion\n   from ml_requests\n   where user_id = @user_id and questionnaire = 1 and context = 1\n   group by prompt"
   user_id:x:@.arguments/*/user_id
