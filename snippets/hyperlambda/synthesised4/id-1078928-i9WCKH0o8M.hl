// 1. `@.token`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "token" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, checking each node's name until it finds one named "token". If it finds such a node, it returns it. This is useful in scenarios where you need to access a specific node that might be located at different levels in the hierarchy, such as retrieving a token value for authentication or session management purposes.
