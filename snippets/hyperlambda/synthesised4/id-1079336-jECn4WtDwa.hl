// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "sql" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. The `@` symbol signifies that it is looking for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that it is looking within the current context or scope. This expression is useful when you need to reference a specific node named "sql" that has been defined earlier in the Hyperlambda code. A potential use case could be retrieving a SQL query or command that has been previously set up in the Hyperlambda structure for execution or manipulation.
