// The Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a SQL read operation on a "clients" table using SQLite. It specifies an aggregate function under [columns], aliases the result as "result", and includes a [where] clause with an [and] condition. The code also groups the results by "group_column" using the [group] slot.
