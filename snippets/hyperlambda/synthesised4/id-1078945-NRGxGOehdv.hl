/*
 * 1. `@http` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "http" in the current context. It is typically used to locate nodes related to HTTP operations or configurations.
 * 
 * 2. `post` - This iterator further filters the result to find a child node named "post" under the previously found "http" node. It is commonly used to identify HTTP POST request configurations or data.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve the configuration or data associated with an HTTP POST request within a larger Hyperlambda structure, such as when setting up or processing an API endpoint that handles POST requests.
