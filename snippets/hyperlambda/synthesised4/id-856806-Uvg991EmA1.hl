// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [set-value] slot to modify the value of a node identified by the expression [@.fk]. It concatenates various strings and values retrieved through [get-value] to form a foreign key constraint string. The concatenation includes static strings and dynamic values from nodes, creating a structured SQL foreign key reference statement. The [strings.concat] slot is used to assemble the final string, which is then assigned to the node specified by [set-value].
