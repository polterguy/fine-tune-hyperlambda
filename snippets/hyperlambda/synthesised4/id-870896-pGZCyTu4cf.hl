// Iterates over each node in the [data.select] collection, concatenating the values of [prompt] and [completion] nodes into a [conv] node. The [strings.concat] slot is used to join these values with newline characters, effectively creating a formatted string. The [set-value] slot assigns the concatenated result to the [conv] node, updating its value with each iteration.
