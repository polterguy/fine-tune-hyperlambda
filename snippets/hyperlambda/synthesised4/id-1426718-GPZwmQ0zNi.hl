/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet lists all files and folders in the "/etc/system/openai/temp/" directory. It iterates over each file, deleting them unless they are named "README.md". After handling the files, it lists all folders in the same directory and deletes each one. This effectively cleans up the directory by removing all files except "README.md" and all folders. 
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Begins an else block for conditional logic.
 * 2. [io.file.list] - Lists all files in the specified directory.
 * 3. [for-each] - Iterates over each file listed in the directory.
 * 4. [if] - Checks a condition for each file.
 * 5. [neq] - Compares the current file's path to "/etc/system/openai/temp/README.md".
 * 6. [.lambda] - Executes the following block if the condition is true.
 * 7. [io.file.delete] - Deletes the current file if it is not "README.md".
 * 8. [io.folder.list] - Lists all folders in the specified directory.
 * 9. [for-each] - Iterates over each folder listed in the directory.
 * 10. [io.folder.delete] - Deletes the current folder.
