// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.filename] node to the value retrieved from a nested node structure within [.arguments]. The [set-value] slot targets [.filename] and assigns it the value obtained by [get-value] from the path [.arguments/*/file/*/name]. This allows dynamic assignment based on the provided arguments structure.
set-value:x:@.filename
