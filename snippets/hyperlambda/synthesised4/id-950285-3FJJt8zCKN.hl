// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes from two different sources into a target node. It retrieves nodes from [service1] and [service2] using [get-nodes] and appends them to the [result] node under [.data]. This allows for combining data from multiple sources into a single node structure.
add:x:@.data/*/result
   get-nodes:x:@.service1/*
   get-nodes:x:@.service2/*
