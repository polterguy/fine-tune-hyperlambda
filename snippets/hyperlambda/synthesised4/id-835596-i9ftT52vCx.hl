/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to add nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] from the [.arguments] node into the [args] node within a [sockets.signal] node. This allows for dynamic aggregation of arguments into a signal's arguments before broadcasting. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds nodes to the specified location.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the specified expression.
 * 3. [.arguments] - Represents the source node from which nodes are retrieved.
 * 4. [sockets.signal] - Represents the target node where nodes are added.
 * 5. [args] - The specific child node within [sockets.signal] where nodes are aggregated.
