// This Hyperlambda code snippet concatenates the current value of the [.result] node with values extracted from a SQL query result, specifically targeting the [sql] node within the data set. The [set-value] slot updates the [.result] node with this concatenated string, which includes a newline character for formatting. The [strings.concat] slot is used to merge these values into a single string.
