// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to append a new node to the [sitemap] node. It uses an expression to set the value of the newly added node by referencing the value from another node specified by the expression [x:@.value]. This allows dynamic value assignment during the node addition process.
add:x:@.sitemap
   .
      .:x:@.value
