/*
 * 1. `@.relevant`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "relevant" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will stop as soon as it finds the first match. This is useful when you need to access a specific ancestor node that might contain important data or configuration settings relevant to the current context. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: If you are processing a nested data structure and need to find a configuration or setting that is defined at a higher level in the hierarchy, this expression can quickly locate the "relevant" node without having to manually traverse each level.
