// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.full-path] node by concatenating a static string "/modules/" with the value obtained from the [name] node within the [file] node under [.arguments]. The [set-value] slot is used to assign the concatenated result to [.full-path], while [strings.concat] combines the static path with the dynamic file name. The [get-value] slot retrieves the file name from the specified node path.
