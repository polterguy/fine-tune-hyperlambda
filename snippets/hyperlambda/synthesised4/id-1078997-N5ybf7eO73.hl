/*
 * 1. `@mysql.select` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named `mysql.select`. It is used to locate the node that likely contains SQL selection logic or configuration for a MySQL database query. This is the starting point for the expression.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `mysql.select` node. It is used to access the detailed configuration or parameters of the SQL select operation, such as columns to be selected, conditions, or other query-related settings.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to dynamically access and manipulate the parameters or configuration of a MySQL select query within a Hyperlambda script.
 * - It might be used to iterate over query parameters to modify them, log them, or validate them before executing the query.
