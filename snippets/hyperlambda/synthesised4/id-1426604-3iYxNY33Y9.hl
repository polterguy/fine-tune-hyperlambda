// The [case] node in a [switch] statement is used to define a specific condition or value that, when matched with the evaluated value of the [switch], will execute the associated lambda object. In this example, the [case] node has a value of type ushort, which means it will match against an unsigned short integer value. If the evaluated value of the [switch] matches this ushort value, the code block within this [case] will be executed.
