// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to convert a base64 encoded string back to its original form using the [convert] slot. It targets the node [.encoded] and specifies the conversion type as "from-base64". The [convert] slot takes an expression pointing to the node to be converted and a [type] argument indicating the desired conversion type.
convert:x:@.encoded
   type:from-base64
