// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [get-count] slot to count the number of child nodes under the [.session] node. The [get-count] slot evaluates the expression provided, which in this case is pointing to all children of the [.session] node, and returns the total count of these nodes. This is useful for determining the number of items or elements within a specific node in a Hyperlambda structure.
