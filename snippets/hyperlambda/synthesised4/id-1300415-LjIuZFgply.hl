// This Hyperlambda code is designed to perform a SQL query on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "Orders" table and joining it with the "Employees" and "Shippers" tables. The [data.read] slot is used to initiate the read operation, specifying the database type as SQLite with [database-type]. The main table being queried is "Orders", and it is joined with "Employees" and "Shippers" using left joins, as indicated by the [join] slots with [type:left]. The join conditions are defined using the [on] and [and] slots, ensuring that the "EmployeeID" and "ShipVia" fields are matched appropriately between the tables. The [columns] slot specifies the columns to be retrieved from the query, including various fields from the "Orders" table and specific fields from the joined tables, with aliases provided using the [as] slot for clarity. The [where] slot is present but currently does not define any conditions, allowing for the retrieval of all records. Finally, the [return-nodes] slot is used to return the results of the query. This setup is useful for extracting detailed order information along with employee and shipper details in a single query.
