// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a placeholder string within a target string. The code specifically targets the [version] placeholder within the [.result] node and replaces it with the first value retrieved from a node set specified by the [get-value] slot, which points to the [v] node within the [.arguments] node. The [get-first-value] slot is used to ensure only the first value is retrieved for the replacement.
