/*
 * 1. `@.allowed`: This iterator searches for the first node named "allowed" in the current context. It starts from the current node and traverses upwards through its ancestors and siblings until it finds a node with the specified name. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to check if a specific feature or action is permitted by looking for a node named "allowed" in the current execution context. If found, it might indicate that the operation is allowed to proceed.
