// This Hyperlambda code concatenates a base directory path with a file name and extension to form a complete file path, and then sets this path as the value of the [.file] node. It uses [strings.concat] to join the directory path, file name, and extension, and [get-value] to retrieve the file name from the current node being iterated over in a loop.
