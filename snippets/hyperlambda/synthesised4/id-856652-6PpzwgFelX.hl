// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to append nodes into the children collection of the [.prop] node. It creates a new node under [.prop] with a [description] node, where the value is dynamically retrieved from the [description] node of the currently iterated node, referenced by [.dp]. The [x:@.dp/#/*/description] expression fetches the description value from the current node being processed.
add:x:@.prop/*
