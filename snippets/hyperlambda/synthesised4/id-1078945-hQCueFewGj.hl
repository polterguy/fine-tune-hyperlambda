/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. The [.] indicates it's looking for a node with this exact name, and the `@` symbol means it will search for the first occurrence of this node in the current hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It allows you to access any nodes that are directly under [.arguments].
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "session" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It effectively narrows down the selection to nodes that have the specific name "session".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access a session-related parameter or configuration that is passed as part of the arguments in a Hyperlambda execution context.
 * - It might be used in an HTTP endpoint to retrieve session information from the request arguments, allowing the endpoint to perform actions based on the current session state.
