// This Hyperlambda snippet sets the value of the [.final-xp] node to the result of a [math.add] operation. The [set-value] slot changes the value of the node specified in its expression, while the [get-value] slot retrieves the result of the [math.add] operation, which is then assigned to [.final-xp].
set-value:x:@.final-xp
