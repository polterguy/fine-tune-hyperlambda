// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a MySQL database using the [data.read] slot. It specifies the database type as MySQL and targets the "users" table. The [columns] node includes an aggregate function [count(*)] to count the number of records, and the result is aliased as "count". The [limit] is set to 1, which restricts the result set to a single record.
