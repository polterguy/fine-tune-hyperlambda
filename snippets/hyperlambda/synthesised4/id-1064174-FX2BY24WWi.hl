/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. This is useful for accessing the arguments node in a Hyperlambda structure, which typically contains input parameters for a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node set. In this context, it will retrieve all children of the "arguments" node. This is useful when you want to process or evaluate all arguments passed to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `aggregate_function` - This iterator filters the previously selected node set to include only nodes with the name "aggregate_function". This is useful for pinpointing a specific argument or parameter within the "arguments" node, particularly when you need to perform operations or evaluations based on this specific argument.
