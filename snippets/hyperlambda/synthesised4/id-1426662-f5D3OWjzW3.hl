/*
 * This Hyperlambda code adds a log entry with the message "Access denied" to a specific node path within a lambda object. The [add] slot is used to insert the log entry at the specified location, which is determined by the lambda expression pointing to the [timeshifts] node's [access_denied] child node, under the [items] node. The [log.timeshift] slot is used to create the log entry. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts a new node at the specified location in the lambda object.
 * 2. [log.timeshift] - Creates a log entry with the message "Access denied".
