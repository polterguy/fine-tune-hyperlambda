/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if the value obtained from [strings.replace] starts with the string "enum". If it does, it sets the value of [.type] to "string". If it doesn't, it defaults to setting [.type] to "string". The code uses conditional branching with [if] and [else] to determine the value of [.type] based on the condition.
 * 
 * 1. [default] - Declares the start of a default block.
 * 2. [if] - Begins a conditional check.
 * 3. [strings.starts-with] - Checks if the result of [strings.replace] starts with "enum".
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 5. [set-value] - Sets the value of [.type] to "string" if the condition is true.
 * 6. [else] - Executes if the [if] condition is false.
 * 7. [set-value] - Sets the value of [.type] to "string" as a default action.
