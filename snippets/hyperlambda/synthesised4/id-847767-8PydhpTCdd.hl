/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Treatments" and "Patients". 
 * // The join is based on the "PatientID" column from both tables, using the alias "PatientID" for the "Patients" table.
 * // The [join] slot specifies the table to join, [as] provides an alias, [type] defines the join type, and [on] specifies the join condition.
 * [join] - Specifies the table to join with.
 * [as] - Provides an alias for the joined table.
 * [type] - Defines the type of join, in this case, a left join.
 * [on] - Specifies the condition for the join.
 * [and] - Combines multiple conditions for the join.
 * [Treatments.PatientID] - The column from the "Treatments" table used in the join condition.
 * [PatientID.PatientID] - The column from the "Patients" table, aliased as "PatientID", used in the join condition.
