/*
 * 1. `@html2lambda`: This iterator searches for the first node named `html2lambda` within the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with this name. This is useful for targeting a specific section of a larger Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `html2lambda` node. It is used to access the next level of nodes in the hierarchy, allowing the expression to traverse deeper into the node structure.
 * 
 * 3. `head`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find a node named `head`. This is useful for narrowing down the search to a specific part of the document, such as the head section of an HTML-like structure.
 * 
 * 4. `*`: Similar to the previous `*` iterator, this retrieves all children nodes of the `head` node. This step is necessary to access elements within the head section, such as metadata or links.
 * 
 * 5. `base`: This iterator filters the children nodes of the `head` node to find a node named `base`. The `base` node is typically used to specify a base URL for relative URLs in an HTML document, so this expression could be used to extract or manipulate the base URL in a Hyperlambda representation of an HTML document.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting the base URL from an HTML document represented in Hyperlambda to resolve relative URLs.
 * - Modifying the base URL in a Hyperlambda structure to change how relative URLs are interpreted in a web scraping or web automation task.
