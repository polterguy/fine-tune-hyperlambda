// The code snippet constructs an SQL query string by concatenating various parts. It uses the [set-value] slot to set the value of the [.sql] node, and the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate the current SQL string with additional parts. The [get-value] slot retrieves the current SQL string, and static strings are added to form the final query, which includes a "from campaigns" clause and a "where keyword_count > 0" condition.
