// This Hyperlambda code snippet retrieves the value from the node path [json2lambda/*/choices/0/*/finish_reason] and assigns it to the node [finish_reason]. The [set-value] slot is used to change the value of [finish_reason] to whatever value is found at the specified path within the lambda object. The [get-value] slot is used to access the value at the given path.
