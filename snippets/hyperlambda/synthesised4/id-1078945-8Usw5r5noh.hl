/*
 * 1. `@.only-prompt`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "only-prompt" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node itself, until it finds a match. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name within the current context or hierarchy, especially when the node might not be a direct child but is still relevant to the current operation. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or metadata nodes that are defined at a higher level in the hierarchy but are still applicable to the current context.
 * - Retrieving a specific node that acts as a flag or marker within a larger structure, ensuring that the operation considers the entire context rather than just immediate children.
