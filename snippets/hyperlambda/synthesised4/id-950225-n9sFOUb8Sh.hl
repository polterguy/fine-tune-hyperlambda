// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. It sets the value of the [.result] node to "Value is neither 1 nor 2" when none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are met. The [else] slot executes its child nodes unconditionally if all previous conditional slots evaluate to false.
