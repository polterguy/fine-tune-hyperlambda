// The code uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.res] node to "OK". The [set-value] slot takes an expression pointing to the node whose value needs to be changed, and a child node providing the new value. In this case, the expression points to the [.res] node, and the new value is the static string "OK".
set-value:x:@.res
