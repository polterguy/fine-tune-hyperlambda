/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all the children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument passed into the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `tableName` - This iterator filters the children nodes retrieved by the `*` iterator to find the node specifically named "tableName". It is used to access the value of the argument named "tableName" if it exists among the children of the "arguments" node.
