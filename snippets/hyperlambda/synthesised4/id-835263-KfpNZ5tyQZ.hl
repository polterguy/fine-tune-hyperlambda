// This Hyperlambda code checks if a condition is true and a value is not null, then attempts to set a crawl delay by multiplying a value by 1000. If the delay exceeds 60 seconds, it signals a warning and caps the delay at 60 seconds. If an error occurs during the conversion, it signals a warning and sets the delay to 10 seconds. The code uses slots like [if], [and], [neq], [try], [catch], [set-value], [math.multiply], [convert], [mt], and [sockets.signal] to achieve its functionality.
