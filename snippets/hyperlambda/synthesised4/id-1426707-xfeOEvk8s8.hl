// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, it uses the "+" expression to forward evaluate the expressions, allowing the values to be unwrapped before execution. This is useful for dynamically evaluating nodes and their expressions in a Hyperlambda graph.
