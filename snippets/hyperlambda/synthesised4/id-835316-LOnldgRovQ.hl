// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, [unwrap] is used to evaluate the expression "+/*/*", which navigates through the node structure, before the node itself is processed.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
