/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator looks for the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments provided to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access the individual argument nodes within the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `ml_training_snippets` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "ml_training_snippets" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target nodes related to machine learning training snippets.
 * 
 * 4. `prompt` - This iterator further filters the result set to only include nodes named "prompt" within the "ml_training_snippets" node. It is used to access the prompt data within the machine learning training snippets.
 * 
 * 5. `like` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "like" within the "prompt" node. It is used to access specific data or attributes related to the "like" aspect of the prompt.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include accessing and manipulating specific parts of machine learning training data, such as retrieving or modifying the "like" attribute of a prompt within training snippets, which could be useful for tasks like data preprocessing or analysis in machine learning workflows.
