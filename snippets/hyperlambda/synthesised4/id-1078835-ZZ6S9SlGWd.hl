/*
 * 1. `@endpoints.list`: This iterator searches for the first node named "endpoints.list" in the current context. It begins the traversal from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy until it finds a node with this name. This is useful for locating specific nodes in a potentially large and complex Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all the children of the "endpoints.list" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, which is helpful when you want to perform operations on or analyze all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * 
 * - Retrieving a list of all endpoints defined under the "endpoints.list" node, which could be used for documentation, analysis, or dynamic configuration purposes.
 * - Iterating over each endpoint to apply a common operation, such as validation or transformation, to all endpoints in a system.
