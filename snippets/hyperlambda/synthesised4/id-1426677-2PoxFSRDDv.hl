 * // This Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and execute a specific node in the hierarchy. 
 * // The expression points to a node within a structure that involves handling errors and feedback channels in a site crawling context.
 * // 1. [unwrap] - This slot is used to evaluate and execute the node specified by the expression.
 * // 2. [x:./*/signal/=magic.ai.crawl-site/*/.onerror/*/.feedback-channel] - This expression navigates through the node hierarchy to locate the specific node to be unwrapped. It starts from the current node, looks for a "signal" node, filters for a node with the value "magic.ai.crawl-site", and further navigates through "onerror" and "feedback-channel" nodes.
