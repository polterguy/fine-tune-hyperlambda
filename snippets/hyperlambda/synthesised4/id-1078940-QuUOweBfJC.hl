/*
 * 1. `@.file-data` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "file-data" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing a specific node in the hierarchy that contains data related to a file.
 * 
 * 2. `/0` - This retrieves the first child node of the "file-data" node. It is used to access the first element in a list or collection of nodes under "file-data".
 * 
 * 3. `/*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It is useful for iterating over or accessing all elements within a specific node.
 * 
 * 4. `/"{@.arguments/*/completion}"` - This is an extrapolated expression that evaluates to a string value obtained from the "completion" node under the ".arguments" node. It is used to dynamically access a child node with a name that matches the evaluated string. This is particularly useful for accessing nodes with dynamic names based on runtime data.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used in a scenario where you need to access a specific piece of data from a file structure, where the exact data point to access is determined at runtime based on user input or other dynamic factors. For example, it could be used in a system that processes file metadata and retrieves specific attributes based on user queries.
