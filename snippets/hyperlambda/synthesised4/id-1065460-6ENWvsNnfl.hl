// 1. `@.fields`: This iterator searches for the first node named "fields" starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy. It will return the first "fields" node it encounters. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located higher up in the tree structure, allowing you to retrieve its value or perform operations on it.
