/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "result" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It stops searching as soon as it finds the first matching node. This is useful when you want to locate a specific node by name in the current context or its ancestors.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the node(s) found by the previous iterator. In this case, it will return all children nodes of the "result" node. This is useful when you want to process or evaluate all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - You might use this expression to gather all child nodes of a "result" node to perform operations like aggregation, transformation, or validation on these child nodes.
 * - It could be used in a scenario where you need to extract and manipulate data from a "result" node, such as in a data processing or reporting task.
