// The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expression provided and assigns its result to the node specified in its expression. In this example, [unwrap:x:+] evaluates the expression pointing to the next sibling node, effectively setting the value of [.dest] to "Hello World" before the instruction pointer reaches it. This is useful for pre-evaluating expressions within a lambda object.
