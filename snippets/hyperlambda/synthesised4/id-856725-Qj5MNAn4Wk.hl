// The Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by its expression value. It targets a specific node path to extract and evaluate the [.type] node within the [.onerror] node of the [magic.ai.crawl-site] signal. This allows dynamic evaluation and manipulation of the node's value in the context of error handling during a site crawl operation.
