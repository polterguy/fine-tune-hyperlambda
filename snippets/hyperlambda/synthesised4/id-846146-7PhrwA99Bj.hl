// The [type] slot in Hyperlambda returns the type name of a given node's value. In the example provided, the node [.foo] is declared with an integer type and a value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to retrieve the type name of the node directly above it, which in this case is "int". This functionality is useful for dynamically determining the data type of a node's value within a Hyperlambda script.
