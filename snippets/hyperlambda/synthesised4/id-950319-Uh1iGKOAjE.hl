// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [yield] slot in Hyperlambda, which returns a value or node list from a dynamic slot or file execution. Here, it returns the value of the [result] node located within the [.dog] node, effectively passing this result back to the caller or context from which the dynamic slot was executed.
yield
   result:x:@.dog.result
