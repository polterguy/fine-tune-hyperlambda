// This Hyperlambda code checks if the status code of an HTTP POST request is less than 300. If the condition is true, it implies that the HTTP request was successful, as status codes below 300 indicate success in HTTP protocol. The [lt] slot is used to perform the "less than" comparison, where [x:@http.post] retrieves the status code of the HTTP POST request, and [.:int:300] provides the integer value 300 for comparison.
lt:x:@http.post
   .:int:300
