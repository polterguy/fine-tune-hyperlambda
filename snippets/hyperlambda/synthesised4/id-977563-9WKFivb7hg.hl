// This Hyperlambda code uses [set-value] to change the values of all nodes within [.form] to the values of the current node being iterated by [for-each]. The [set-value] expression uses a lambda expression with [get-name] to dynamically determine the target nodes' names within [.form], while [get-value] retrieves the current node's value. This pattern is useful for dynamically updating a set of nodes based on another set's structure and values.
