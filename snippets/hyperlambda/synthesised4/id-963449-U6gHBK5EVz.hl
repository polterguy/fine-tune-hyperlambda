// The code demonstrates the use of the [if] slot to evaluate a condition and execute a lambda object if the condition is true. The [if] slot checks a boolean condition, and if it evaluates to true, it executes the [set-value] slot within its [.lambda] block to set the value of the [result] node to "First". However, since the condition is false, the [.lambda] block will not be executed.
