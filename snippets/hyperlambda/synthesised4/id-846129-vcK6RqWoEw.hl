 * The code demonstrates the use of the [remove-nodes] slot to remove a specific node from a node set. It targets the first node resulting from a [strings.split] operation and removes it from the structure.
 * 
 * 1. [remove-nodes] - Removes the node specified by the expression.
 * 2. [strings.split] - Splits a string into multiple nodes based on a delimiter.
 * 3. [0] - Targets the first node in the result set of the [strings.split] operation.
