/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "sql" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts searching from the current node's context and moves upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to access a specific node named "sql" that might contain SQL query information or database connection details. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a SQL query string or configuration from a node named "sql" to execute a database operation.
 * - Accessing SQL-related metadata or settings stored in a node named "sql" for further processing or validation.
