 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet updates the [type] node of all children of the [prop] node's children to the [type] value of the currently iterated node's children. 
 * // It uses [set-value] to change the value of the [type] node, and [get-value] to retrieve the [type] value from the currently iterated node.
 * // 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the nodes referenced by its expression.
 * // 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node its expression is pointing to.
