// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [math.add] slot to add values. It retrieves the value of the node pointed to by [.dp] using [get-value] and adds it to the node specified by [math.add] with the expression [x:@.sum]. This operation is typically used to accumulate or sum values in a loop or iterative process.
