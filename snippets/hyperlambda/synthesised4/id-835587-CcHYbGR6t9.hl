// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL read operation using a left join on a SQLite database. It joins the "Employees" table with itself, aliasing the second instance as "ReportsTo", based on the condition that the "ReportsTo" column in the first table matches the "EmployeeID" in the second. The result includes an aggregated column named "result". The query is limited to one record. Key slots include [data.read] for initiating the read, [join] for the table join, and [columns] for specifying the result set.
