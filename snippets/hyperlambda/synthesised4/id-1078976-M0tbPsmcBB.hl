/*
 * 1. `@csv2lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "csv2lambda" from the current context. It is useful for targeting specific nodes by name, especially when dealing with complex node structures where multiple nodes might have similar children.
 *    
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "csv2lambda" node. It is useful for accessing all direct descendants of a node, allowing for operations on each child node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of each child node of "csv2lambda". This allows for accessing nodes that are two levels deep in the hierarchy, enabling operations on nested structures.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to process or manipulate data that is structured in a hierarchical manner, such as converting CSV data into a more complex node structure.
 * - It can be applied in scenarios where you need to iterate over and perform actions on deeply nested data within a specific section of a larger data structure.
