// The code snippet demonstrates how to add a new node with a specified value to an existing node set. It uses the [add] slot to insert a child node named [model_size] with an integer value of 8192 under the node referenced by the expression [@.model]. This operation effectively extends the node structure by appending the new node as a child of the specified parent node.
