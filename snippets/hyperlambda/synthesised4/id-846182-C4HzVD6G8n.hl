// This Hyperlambda code constructs a connection string by concatenating a series of values. It uses [set-value] to assign the result to [.connection], employing [strings.concat] to combine the values of [connection-string] and [database] from [.arguments], separated by a pipe character and enclosed in square brackets.
set-value:x:@.connection
   strings.concat
      .:[
      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/connection-string
      .:|
      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/database
