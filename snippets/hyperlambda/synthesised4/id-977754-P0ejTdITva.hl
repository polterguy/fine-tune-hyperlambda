// This Hyperlambda code updates the "orders" table by setting the "status" field to "Shipped" for records where the "status" is "Pending" and the "region" is "EU". The [data.update] slot specifies the table and the values to update, while the [where] clause defines the conditions that the records must meet to be updated. The use of [and] ensures that both conditions must be true for the update to occur.
