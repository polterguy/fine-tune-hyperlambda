// This Hyperlambda code uses the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] to a destination. The [add] slot targets a destination specified by its expression, while [get-nodes] fetches nodes from a specified source. The code effectively appends nodes from [.arg] to the destination node's children collection.
