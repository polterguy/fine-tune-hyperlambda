/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "result" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the "." prefix suggests it starts from the current node's context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access a result node that holds the outcome of a previous computation or operation within the same context.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to verify or manipulate the result of a prior operation, such as checking the result of a calculation or a database query.
