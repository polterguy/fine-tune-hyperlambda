// This Hyperlambda snippet modifies the value of the [.greeting] node by replacing all occurrences of a single quote (') with an escaped single quote (\\'). The [set-value] slot updates the [.greeting] node with the result of the [strings.replace] operation, which searches for the single quote character and substitutes it with the escaped version. This is useful for preparing strings for contexts where single quotes need to be escaped, such as in certain programming languages or data formats.
