// The [and] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate multiple boolean conditions, returning true only if all conditions are true. It short-circuits evaluation, meaning it stops evaluating further conditions once a false condition is encountered. This allows for efficient logical operations and can be used in complex conditional structures.
