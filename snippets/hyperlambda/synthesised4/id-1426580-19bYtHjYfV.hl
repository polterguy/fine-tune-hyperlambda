/*
 * This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database using the [sqlite.connect] slot, specifying either a generic or magic connection type. It then executes an SQL statement loaded from a file using the [sqlite.execute] slot, with the SQL content being dynamically loaded through the [io.file.load] slot. The code effectively allows execution of SQL commands stored in a file against a SQLite database. 
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Initiates a conditional branch or case statement.
 * 2. [sqlite.connect] - Connects to a SQLite database, specifying the connection type.
 * 3. [sqlite.execute] - Executes an SQL statement against the connected SQLite database.
 * 4. [io.file.load] - Loads the content of a file, which in this case contains the SQL statement to be executed.
