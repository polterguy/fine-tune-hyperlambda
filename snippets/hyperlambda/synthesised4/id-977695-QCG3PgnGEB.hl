/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [while] loop to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. The loop checks if the value of [.continue] is true, and if so, it logs a message indicating that the condition is still true and the loop will iterate again. The loop will continue executing until the condition evaluates to false. 
 * 
 * 1. [while] - Initiates a loop that continues as long as the specified condition is true.
 * 2. [eq] - Checks if the value of [.continue] is equal to true.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the block of code to execute during each iteration of the loop.
 * 4. [log.info] - Logs a message indicating that the condition is still true, prompting another iteration.
