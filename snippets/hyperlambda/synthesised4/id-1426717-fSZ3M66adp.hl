/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a node named "return" to the parent node of the current context. The "return" node contains two child nodes: "context" and "snippets". The "context" node retrieves a value from the current context, while the "snippets" node is simply a static node without a value. The code effectively modifies the parent node by inserting a "return" node with specified children, potentially to structure or organize data for further processing or evaluation.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts a new node named "return" to the parent node of the current context.
 * 2. [context] - Retrieves a value from the current context and assigns it to the "context" node.
 * 3. [snippets] - Adds a static node named "snippets" without a value.
