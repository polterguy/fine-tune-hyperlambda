/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by locating the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by its name, and the `.` prefix implies it should look for a node with the exact name `.arguments`. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the `.arguments` node. It essentially expands the node set to include all direct children nodes under `.arguments`. This is useful when you want to perform operations or checks on each argument passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `/password`: This iterator filters the node set to only include nodes named `password`. After retrieving all children of the `.arguments` node, it narrows down the selection to nodes specifically named `password`. This is commonly used to access or validate sensitive information like passwords within the arguments.
