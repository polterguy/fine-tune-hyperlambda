/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. This is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `/offset` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `offset`. It is used to specifically retrieve the `offset` argument from the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to access a specific argument named `offset` that has been passed to a function or endpoint. It allows you to dynamically retrieve and work with the value of the `offset` argument, which could be used for pagination, time-based calculations, or other purposes where an offset value is required.
