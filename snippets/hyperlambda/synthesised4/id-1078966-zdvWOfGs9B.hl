/*
 * 1. `@.msg`: This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which indicates that it will find the first node having a name of "msg" in the current context. The `.` before "msg" specifies that it should look for this node at the current level or up the hierarchy, but not among siblings or children. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve a message node in a Hyperlambda script, which might contain a string or data that needs to be processed or logged.
 * - It could be used in a validation or logging scenario where the content of the "msg" node is required for further operations or decision-making.
