// This Hyperlambda code snippet creates a new JWT token using the [auth.ticket.create] slot. It takes a username and an expiration date from the [.arguments] node, and includes roles in the token. The [username] and [expires] slots extract their values from the [.arguments] node, allowing dynamic assignment based on input. The [roles] node is prepared to include user roles in the token, enhancing security by defining access levels.
