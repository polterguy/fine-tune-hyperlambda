// The Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [data.delete] slot to remove records from a "logs" table. It specifies a [where] clause with conditions using [and], targeting records where the "level" field equals "ERROR" and the "last_updated" field is less than "2024-01-01". The code effectively filters and deletes specific log entries based on these criteria.
