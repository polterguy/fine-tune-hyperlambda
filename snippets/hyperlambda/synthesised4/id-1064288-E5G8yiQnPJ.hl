/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy until it finds a node with the name "arguments". This is useful for accessing a specific section of the Hyperlambda graph that contains arguments or parameters passed into a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node, regardless of their names. This allows for iterating over or accessing all argument nodes provided within the "arguments" section.
 * 
 * 3. `direction` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "direction" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target and retrieve the node that contains the "direction" argument or parameter, which might be used for controlling the flow or behavior of the subsequent logic in the Hyperlambda code.
