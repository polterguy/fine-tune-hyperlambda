// The code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot in Hyperlambda, which is part of a [switch] statement. It allows you to define different cases to execute based on the value of a given expression. The [case] slot is used to specify a condition, and if the condition matches the expression provided to the [switch] slot, the associated code block is executed. This is useful for branching logic based on specific values or conditions.
