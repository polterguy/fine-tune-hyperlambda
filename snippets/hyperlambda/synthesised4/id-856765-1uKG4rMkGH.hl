/*
 * The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] construct to evaluate multiple conditions and execute the associated code block of the first matching case. It allows for cleaner and more readable conditional branching by grouping related conditions together. Below is an example of how to use the [case] slot within a [switch] statement.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Initiates a switch statement to evaluate multiple conditions.
 * 2. [case] - Defines a condition to be checked within the switch statement.
 * 3. [default] - Provides a fallback code block if no [case] conditions are met.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code block to execute when a [case] condition is true or in the [default] case.
