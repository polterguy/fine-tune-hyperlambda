/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator searches for the first node named "result" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "result" node it encounters. This is useful when you want to reference a specific node by name that is an ancestor or a sibling of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node(s) returned by the previous iterator. In this case, it will return all children of the "result" node found by `@.result`. This is useful for accessing all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `result`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "result" from the previous result set. It will return all nodes named "result" that are children of the original "result" node. This is useful when you want to further narrow down the node set to specific nodes by name.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve all "result" nodes that are children of a specific "result" node, which is useful in scenarios where you have nested result structures and need to access specific data points within those structures.
