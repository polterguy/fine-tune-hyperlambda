// 1. `@.filename`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "filename" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name within the current execution context, ensuring that you retrieve the correct node even if there are multiple nodes with the same name at different levels.
