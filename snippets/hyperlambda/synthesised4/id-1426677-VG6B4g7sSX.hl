/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace all occurrences of the "/" character with the "_" character in the value of the [type] node. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the string to search for, and the second is the string to replace it with. In this case, it modifies the string value of the [type] node by substituting all "/" characters with "_". 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a specified string within another string.
 * 2. [.] (first child) - Specifies the string to search for ("/").
 * 3. [.] (second child) - Specifies the string to replace with ("_").
