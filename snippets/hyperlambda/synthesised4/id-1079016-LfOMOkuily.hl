/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "result" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name, particularly when you know the node's name but not its exact location relative to the current node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - Retrieving the result of a computation or operation stored in a node named "result".
 * - Accessing a previously set value or outcome in a Hyperlambda script where the node's name is known but its position in the hierarchy might vary.
