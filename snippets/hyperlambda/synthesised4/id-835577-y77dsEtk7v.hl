// The code uses the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the value of the [aggregate_function] node is one of the specified legal values: "min", "max", "sum", or "avg". If the value is not among these, an exception is thrown. This is useful for validating that an input parameter is restricted to a predefined set of options, ensuring data integrity and preventing errors in processing.
