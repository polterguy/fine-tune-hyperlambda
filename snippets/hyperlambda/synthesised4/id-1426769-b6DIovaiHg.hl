// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] statement to define a branch of execution based on a specific value, in this case, the value "bigserial". When the [switch] statement evaluates to "bigserial", the code block under this [case] will be executed. This is useful for handling different scenarios or values in a structured manner, similar to switch-case constructs in other programming languages.
case:bigserial
