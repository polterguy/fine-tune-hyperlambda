// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.create] slot to insert a new record into the "users_extra" table. It specifies the table name and uses the [values] node to define the fields and their corresponding values, which are dynamically retrieved using expressions. The [user] field is set to the value of the [.username] node, and the [value] field is set to the value of the [.email] node, while the [type] field is statically set to "email". This approach helps prevent SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries.
data.create
   table:users_extra
   values
      user:x:@.username
      type:email
      value:x:@.email
