/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] construct to handle multiple conditions. The [switch] slot evaluates the value of [.input], and based on its value, executes the corresponding [case] block. If [.input] matches "option1", "option2", or "option3", the respective [case] block is executed, setting [.result] to a specific string. If none of the cases match, the [default] block sets [.result] to "No match". The code effectively illustrates conditional branching using the [switch] and [case] slots.
 * 
 * 1. [.input] - Represents the value to be evaluated in the [switch] construct.
 * 2. [switch] - Initiates a switch statement to evaluate [.input].
 * 3. [case] - Defines a condition within the switch, executing its children if [.input] matches its value.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to be executed if the [case] condition is met.
 * 5. [set-value] - Sets the value of [.result] based on the matched case.
 * 6. [default] - Executes if none of the [case] conditions are met, providing a fallback action.
