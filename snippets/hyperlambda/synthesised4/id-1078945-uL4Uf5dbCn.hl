/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator looks for the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda. This is crucial for retrieving input parameters or configurations.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument individually, allowing for operations or evaluations on each one.
 * 
 * 3. `stream`: This iterator filters the children nodes to find the one specifically named "stream". It is used to access or manipulate the "stream" argument, which could represent a data stream or a sequence of data elements.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a specific argument named "stream" within a function to perform operations like reading from or writing to a data stream.
 * - Validating or processing the "stream" argument in a dynamic slot or HTTP endpoint to ensure it meets certain criteria or to transform its data.
