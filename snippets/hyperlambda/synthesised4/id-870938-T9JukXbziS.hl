// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the value of nodes referenced by the expression [@.invocation/*/execute/*/name] to the value retrieved from [@.arguments/*/args/*/action_name]. It uses [set-value] to update the node values and [get-value] to fetch the source value from the specified node path. This operation effectively synchronizes the node values based on the provided argument's action name.
set-value:x:@.invocation/*/execute/*/name
