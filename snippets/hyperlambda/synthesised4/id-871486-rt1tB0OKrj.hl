// The Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database and reads data from the "Doctors" table. It selects a distinct column, aliased as "count", and applies a "where" clause with an "and" condition for filtering. The [data.read] slot is used to perform the database read operation, and the [columns] slot specifies the columns to be retrieved, while [where] and [and] slots define the filtering criteria.
