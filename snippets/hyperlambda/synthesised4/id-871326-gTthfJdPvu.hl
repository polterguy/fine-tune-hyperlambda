// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a database read operation on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "CustomerDemographics" table. It selects an aggregated column, renaming it as "result", and applies a "group by" operation on a specified column. The [where] clause is included but not detailed, indicating conditions can be added for filtering results.
