// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database using a generic or magic adapter and retrieves specific records from the "ml_training_snippets" table. It selects the "id", "prompt", and "completion" columns where the "type" matches a specified argument and the "id" is greater than a given value, ensuring the "embedding" column is null. The results are ordered by "id" and limited to 20 records. The [data.connect] slot establishes the connection, while [data.select] performs the SQL query.
data.connect:[generic|magic]

      data.select:"\nselect id, prompt, completion\n   from ml_training_snippets\n   where type = @type and id > @id and embedding is null order by id limit 20"
