// The code snippet demonstrates how to execute an HTTP GET request using a dynamic URL and optional headers. The [execute] slot is used to invoke the "magic.ai.url.get" slot. The [url] slot dynamically constructs the URL using the [strings.replace] slot, which likely replaces parts of a string to form the final URL. The [headers] slot is included to specify any HTTP headers that may be needed for the request.
execute:magic.ai.url.get
   url:x:@strings.replace
