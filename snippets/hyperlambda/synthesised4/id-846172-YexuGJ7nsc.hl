// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to dynamically add nodes to a specified destination node's children collection. In this example, a node with the name [primary] and a boolean value of true is added to each child node of the [.tmp] node. The [add] slot allows for dynamic node manipulation by appending specified nodes to a target node's children, facilitating flexible data structure modifications.
