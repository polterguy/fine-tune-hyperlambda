// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced, allowing dynamic evaluation of node values. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is used with an expression that traverses multiple levels of nodes, effectively evaluating and replacing the expression with the actual node values before the execution reaches the destination node.
