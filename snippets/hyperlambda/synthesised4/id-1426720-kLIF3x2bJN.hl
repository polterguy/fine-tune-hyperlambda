// This Hyperlambda code snippet performs a SQL query to select specific columns from the "ml_training_snippets" table where certain conditions are met, and adds the result to a node. The query filters records by a specified type and an ID greater than a given value, ensuring the "embedding" field is null, and limits the result to 20 records ordered by ID. The [add] slot is used to store the query results into the [.data] node. The [data.select] slot executes the SQL query, with parameters [type] and [id] dynamically set from the arguments and current node values, respectively.
add:x:@.data
   data.select:@"
select id, prompt, completion
   from ml_training_snippets
   where type = @type and id > @id and embedding is null order by id limit 20"
