/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate up one level in the node hierarchy.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It allows you to access every direct child node.
 * 3. `invoke` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "invoke". It is used to specifically target nodes with this name among the children.
 * 
 * This expression is useful for scenarios where you need to find and work with nodes named "invoke" that are direct children of the parent node of the current context. For example, it could be used in a situation where you want to execute or manipulate all "invoke" nodes within a specific section of a Hyperlambda graph.
