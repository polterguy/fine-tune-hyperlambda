// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each grand child node within the [.profile] node using [for-each], retrieves the name of each node with [get-name], and unwraps all descendant nodes with [unwrap]. It then adds a new node to the [.flattenedProfile] node, containing a [field] node with [key] and [val] sub-nodes, where [key] is the name of the current node and [val] is the value of the current node. This effectively flattens the profile structure into key-value pairs.
