// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator searches for the first node named "sql" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node's position in the hierarchy and moves upwards or sideways to locate the node. This is useful for finding a specific node that might contain SQL query information or configuration settings related to SQL operations within a Hyperlambda structure.
