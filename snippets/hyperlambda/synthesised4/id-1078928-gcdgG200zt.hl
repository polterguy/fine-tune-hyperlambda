/*
 * 1. `@strings.substring`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "strings.substring" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards through the hierarchy until it finds a match. This is useful when you need to apply a substring operation on a string node that is defined elsewhere in the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting a portion of a string for further processing or validation.
 * - Using the substring operation in a dynamic slot to manipulate string data before returning or storing it.
