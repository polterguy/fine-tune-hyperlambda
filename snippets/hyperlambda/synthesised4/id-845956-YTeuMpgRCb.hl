// The code snippet uses the [eq] slot to check if the value retrieved from the [whitelist] node is equal to a specified value. The [get-value] slot is used to obtain the value of the [whitelist] node, and the [eq] slot compares this value with the provided static value. If the values are exactly the same, the [eq] slot evaluates to true.
