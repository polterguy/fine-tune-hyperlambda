// This Hyperlambda code snippet retrieves the first element from the result of a [strings.split] operation and trims whitespace from it. It uses [set-value] to update the value of the first split element with the trimmed result. [strings.split] is assumed to have been executed earlier, and [strings.trim] removes leading and trailing spaces from the specified element.
