// The [lambda2hyper] slot is used to convert a specified lambda object into a Hyperlambda string representation. In this example, it is applied to the result of an [http.post] invocation, which sends an HTTP POST request to a specified URL. This allows for the transformation of the HTTP response, including headers and content, into a Hyperlambda format, enabling easier logging, debugging, or further processing of the response data.
