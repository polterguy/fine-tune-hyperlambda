// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database and deletes records from the "ml_types" table where a specific condition is met. It uses [data.connect] to establish a database connection and [data.delete] to perform the deletion operation, with a [where] clause specifying the condition using [and] and [type.eq] to match the "type" field.
