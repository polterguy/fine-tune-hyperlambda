// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [remove-nodes] slot to remove a subset of nodes from a node collection. The expression [remove-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/[0,2]] targets the first two nodes within the [.arguments] node and removes them from the node graph. This operation is useful for dynamically altering the structure of a node graph by removing specific nodes based on their position.
remove-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/[0,2]
