/*
 * 1. `@http.get` - This iterator looks for the first node named `http.get`. It is often used to access the root node of an HTTP GET request or a similar structure where the root node is named `http.get`.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `http.get` node. It is useful for accessing any direct children nodes without filtering by name.
 * 
 * 3. `headers` - This iterator filters the previous result set to include only nodes named `headers`. It is used to specifically target the headers section of an HTTP request or response.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `headers` node. It allows access to all individual header nodes within the headers section.
 * 
 * 5. `content-type` - This iterator filters the previous result set to include only nodes named `content-type`. It is used to access the specific header node that contains the content type information of the HTTP request or response.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the content type of an HTTP request or response to determine how to process the body of the message.
 * - Logging or validating the content type of incoming HTTP requests to ensure they meet expected formats.
