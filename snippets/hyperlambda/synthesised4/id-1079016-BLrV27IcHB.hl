/*
 * 1. `@.function-result`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "function-result" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that holds the result of a function execution within the same scope or its ancestors. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the result of a previously executed function to use in further calculations or logic.
 * - Accessing a specific node that contains output data for validation or transformation purposes.
