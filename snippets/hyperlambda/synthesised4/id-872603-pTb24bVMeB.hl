// This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL read operation on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "opportunities" table. It includes a left join with the "clients" table, using "client_id" as an alias and joining on matching "client_id" fields. The code selects distinct columns, renaming them with an alias, and sets up a "where" clause for further filtering conditions. The "distinct_functor" is used to ensure unique results in the selection.
