// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to append nodes to a destination node specified by the expression in its main argument. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all children nodes of the node referenced by the [.dp] node's value, and these nodes are then added as children to the [.result] node. This operation effectively copies the children nodes from the source to the destination node.
