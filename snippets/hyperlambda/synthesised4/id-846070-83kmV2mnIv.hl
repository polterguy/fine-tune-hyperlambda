// This Hyperlambda code concatenates parts of a split string to form a URL-like structure. It retrieves the first value from a split operation, adds "://" as a separator, and then appends another value from the split result, setting this concatenated string as the value of the [.base] node. The slots used are [set-value], [strings.concat], and [get-value].
