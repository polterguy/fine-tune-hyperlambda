/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator looks for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument node individually.
 * 
 * 3. `supervised` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `supervised`. It is used to find a specific argument named `supervised` within the arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to access the value of a specific argument named `supervised` within a Hyperlambda function or slot, which might be used for conditional logic or processing based on the presence or value of this argument.
