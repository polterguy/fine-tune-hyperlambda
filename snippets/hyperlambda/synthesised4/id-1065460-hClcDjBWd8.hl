// 1. `@.sql` - This iterator is used to find the first node named "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and the `.` before `sql` specifies that it should start the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you have a structured Hyperlambda graph and you need to access a specific node by its name, ensuring that you are referencing the correct part of the graph for further operations or evaluations.
