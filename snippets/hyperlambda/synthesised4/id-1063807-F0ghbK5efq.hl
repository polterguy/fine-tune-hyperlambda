/*
 * This expression is a lambda expression used in Hyperlambda to reference a specific node. Let's break down the iterators:
 * 
 * 1. `@` - This iterator is used to find the first node with the specified name. In this expression, it will look for the first node named `io.file.load`. It does not traverse siblings but looks within the current context of the node hierarchy.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression can be used when you need to reference a node named `io.file.load` within your Hyperlambda code. This might be useful in scenarios where you are dealing with file operations and need to load a file using the specified node. The `@` iterator ensures that the search is efficient by stopping at the first match.
