// The Hyperlambda code snippet dynamically adds nodes to a specified destination node's children collection. It uses the [add] slot to append a node with a name and value derived from an expression. Specifically, it adds a node named [crawl-delay] with its value obtained from the [.crawl-delay] node, to the children of nodes referenced by the expression [@try/*/return].
add:x:@try/*/return
   .
      crawl-delay:x:@.crawl-delay
