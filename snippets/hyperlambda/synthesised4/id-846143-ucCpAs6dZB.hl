// This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.replace-not-of] slot to replace every character in the [.value] node that is not a digit (0-9) with an empty string, effectively removing all non-digit characters. The slot takes two arguments: [0123456789] specifies the allowed characters, and the second argument is an empty string indicating the replacement for disallowed characters.
