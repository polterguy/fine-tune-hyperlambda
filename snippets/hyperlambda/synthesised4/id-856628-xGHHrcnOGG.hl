// This Hyperlambda code checks if there are any tasks listed using [tasks.list], and if so, it deletes a specific task named "sqlite.create-backup" using [tasks.delete]. The [if] slot evaluates the condition, and if the [exists] slot returns true, indicating that there are tasks present, the [tasks.delete] slot is executed to remove the specified task.
