// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [stream] node within the [.arguments] node is equal to the boolean value true. It uses the [eq] slot to perform the equality comparison, and the expression "x:@.arguments/*/stream" to locate the [stream] node within the [.arguments] node. If the value of the [stream] node is exactly true, the [eq] slot will evaluate to true.
