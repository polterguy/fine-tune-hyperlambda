/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda structure, especially in the context of HTTP endpoints or dynamic slot executions where arguments are passed.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node(s). In this case, it will retrieve all children of the "arguments" node. This is useful for iterating over or accessing specific arguments passed to a slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `/defaultValue` - This iterator filters the previously selected nodes to only include those with the name "defaultValue". It is used to specifically access the "defaultValue" node among the children of the "arguments" node, which might represent a default value for a parameter or argument in a slot or endpoint.
