// The code snippet demonstrates how to replace parts of a string within a node's value using Hyperlambda. It first concatenates the name of a node with its value using [strings.concat], then replaces occurrences of this concatenated string in the [@.body] node's value using [strings.replace], and finally sets the modified string back to the [@.body] node using [set-value]. The process involves iterating through nodes and dynamically constructing strings based on node names and values.
set-value:x:@.body
   strings.replace:x:@.body
      strings.concat
         .:{{
         get-name:x:@.dp/#
         .:}}
      get-value:x:@.dp/#
