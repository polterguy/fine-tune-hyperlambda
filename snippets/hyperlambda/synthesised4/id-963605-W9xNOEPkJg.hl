// The Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the node referenced by the expression `../*/.foo1` is equal to "OK". If the condition is true, the [eq] slot will evaluate to true. The expression uses relative path navigation to locate the node named ".foo1" and compares its value with the provided static string "OK".
eq:x:../*/.foo1
