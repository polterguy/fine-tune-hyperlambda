/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the name of a specific node within a lambda object. It targets the [max_tokens] node, which is a child of the [payload] node within an [http.post] request. The new name assigned to this node is "max_completion_tokens". This operation is useful for renaming nodes to more meaningful identifiers, improving code readability and maintainability. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the name of a specified node.
 * 2. [x:@.lambda/@.lambda/*/http.post/*/payload/*/max_tokens] - The expression to locate the [max_tokens] node within the lambda object.
 * 3. [.:max_completion_tokens] - The new name assigned to the node, "max_completion_tokens".
