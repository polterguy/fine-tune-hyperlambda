// This Hyperlambda code establishes a connection to a Microsoft SQL Server database named "crm" and deletes a record from the "users" table where the "id" column equals 101. The [mssql.connect] slot opens the database connection, while the [mssql.delete] slot specifies the table and condition for deletion using the [where] clause with an [and] logical operator to ensure the correct record is targeted.
