// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to conditionally execute a block of code when previous conditions are not met. In this case, it uses the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] from the path @data.select/* to the destination specified by @data.connect/*/return/*/snippets. The [else] slot ensures this block is executed only if preceding conditions in the conditional chain evaluate to false.
