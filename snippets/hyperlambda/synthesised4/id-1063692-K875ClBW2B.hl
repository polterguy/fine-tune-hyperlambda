/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is commonly used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda execution context, which typically contains input parameters for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the previously found "arguments" node. It is useful for accessing any parameter nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `strength`: This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes that have the name "strength". It is used to specifically target the "strength" parameter within the arguments, allowing the expression to extract or manipulate its value.
