/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator looks for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. The `.arguments` node is typically used to define or access arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any nodes that are directly under the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `stream` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `stream`. It is used to specifically target nodes named `stream` among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function or slot to access a specific argument named `stream` that was passed to the function. This might be useful in scenarios where the function needs to process or manipulate a data stream provided as an argument.
 * - It could also be used in a validation context to ensure that a required `stream` argument is present before proceeding with further operations.
