// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [not] slot to negate the result of an [eq] (equality) comparison. It checks if the value of the node referenced by [.dp/#] is not equal to the value of the node pointed to by [.arguments/*/word]. If the values are not the same, the [not] slot returns true. The [eq] slot compares the values of the two nodes, and the [not] slot negates the result of this comparison.
