/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [neq] slot to check if the value retrieved from a configuration setting using [config.get] is not equal to a specified value. The [neq] slot is used for inequality comparison, and it requires two arguments. The first argument is an expression pointing to the value obtained from the configuration setting, and the second argument is the value to compare against. If the values are not equal, the [neq] slot evaluates to true.
 * 
 * 1. [neq] - Performs an inequality comparison between two values.
 * 2. [config.get] - Retrieves a configuration setting's value.
 * 3. [.] - Represents the second argument for comparison in the [neq] slot.
