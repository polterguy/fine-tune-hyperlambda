/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node named ".dp" from the current context. It is often used to access a specific node that is expected to be present in the current execution context.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the previously retrieved node. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is another node, allowing you to work with the referenced node directly.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous step. It is used to access all direct descendants of the referenced node.
 * 
 * 4. `status` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "status" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to pinpoint specific nodes by name within the children of the node referenced earlier.
