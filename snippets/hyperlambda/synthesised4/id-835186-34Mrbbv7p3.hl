// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda evaluates expressions before the node is reached, allowing for forward evaluation. In this example, [unwrap] is used to evaluate the expression specified by the iterator "+", which refers to the next sibling node. This ensures that the value of the node is computed and assigned before the Hyperlambda instruction pointer processes it.
