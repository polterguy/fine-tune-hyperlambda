/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "result" that is an ancestor or sibling of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a match. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located at a higher level in the node structure, such as retrieving a result value that was calculated or set earlier in the Hyperlambda execution. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a result node that contains the outcome of a previous computation or operation.
 * - Retrieving a status or message node that is set at a higher level in the hierarchy to determine the flow of subsequent operations.
