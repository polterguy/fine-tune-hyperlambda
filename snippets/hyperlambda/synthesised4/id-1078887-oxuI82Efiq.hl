/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda. In this context, it is likely used to access the arguments of a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access all the parameters or arguments that have been passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `query` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "query". It is used to specifically access the argument or parameter named "query" within the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint to retrieve the value of a specific argument named "query" that has been passed to the function or endpoint.
 * - It can be used in a validation or processing step where the "query" argument is required to perform further operations, such as executing a database query or filtering data based on the query parameter.
