// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.channel] node to the first element of a string split operation. The [set-value] slot changes the value of [.channel] using the result of a [get-value] operation, which retrieves the first element (index 0) from the result of a [strings.split] operation.
set-value:x:@.channel
   get-value:x:@strings.split/0
