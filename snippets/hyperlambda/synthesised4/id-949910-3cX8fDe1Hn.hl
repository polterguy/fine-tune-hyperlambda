// The code snippet demonstrates how to perform a conditional data retrieval from an "employees" table using the [data.read] slot. It specifies a [where] clause with an [or] condition, allowing for retrieval based on either an exact match of the "email" field or a pattern match on the "name" field. The conditions use lambda expressions to dynamically reference arguments provided at runtime.
data.read
   table:employees
   where
      or
         email.eq:x:@.arguments/*/email.eq
         name.like:x:@.arguments/*/name.like
