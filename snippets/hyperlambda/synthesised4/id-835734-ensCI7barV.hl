/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a SQL read operation using the [data.read] slot, targeting a SQLite database. It specifies the [table] as "Doctors" and includes an [aggregate_functor] column, which is aliased as "result". The [where] clause is set to use an [and] logical operator, and the [group] clause is applied on "group_column" to group the results. This setup allows for aggregation and grouping of data from the specified table.
 * 
 * 1. [data.read] - Initiates a SQL read operation.
 * 2. [database-type] - Specifies the database type as SQLite.
 * 3. [table] - Indicates the table to read from, which is "Doctors".
 * 4. [columns] - Lists the columns to be retrieved, including an aggregate function.
 * 5. [aggregate_functor] - Represents an aggregate function, aliased as "result".
 * 6. [where] - Begins a conditional clause using logical operators.
 * 7. [and] - Specifies the logical operator for the where condition.
 * 8. [group] - Defines the column used for grouping the results.
 * 9. [group_column] - The column by which the results are grouped.
