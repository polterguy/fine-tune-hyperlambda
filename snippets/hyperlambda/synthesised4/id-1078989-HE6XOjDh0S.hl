/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `args` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "args". It is used to access a specific argument or parameter named "args" within the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. Here, it retrieves all children of the "args" node.
 * 
 * 5. `table2pk` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "table2pk". It is used to access a specific node named "table2pk" within the "args" node.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - Finally, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children of the "table2pk" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access a list of primary keys or identifiers stored under the "table2pk" node within a set of arguments. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or manipulate data related to specific database tables and their primary keys.
 * - It could be used in a data migration or synchronization process where you need to retrieve and handle primary keys for tables specified in the arguments of a Hyperlambda function.
