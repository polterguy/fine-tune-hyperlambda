/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that the search is for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that the search should start from the current node's context. This is useful when you need to reference a SQL-related node that is part of the current execution context, such as retrieving a SQL query or command that has been defined earlier in the Hyperlambda code. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to execute or manipulate a SQL query that has been defined in a sibling or ancestor node, allowing for dynamic SQL execution or modification based on the current context.
