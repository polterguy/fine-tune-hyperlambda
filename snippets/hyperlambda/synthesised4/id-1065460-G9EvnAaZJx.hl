/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "dp" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is useful for finding a specific node by name within the current context or scope.
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the node is another node itself, allowing you to access and potentially modify the original node directly. This is useful when you need to work with the node's value as a reference rather than a copy.
