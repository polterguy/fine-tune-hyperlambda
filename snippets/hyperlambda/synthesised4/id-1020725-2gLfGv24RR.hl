/*
 * 1. `@data.select` - This iterator searches for the first node named `data.select` in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by its name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you need to access a particular node that might not be a direct child of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all the children of the node found by the previous iterator. It is used to access all the immediate child nodes of `data.select`. This is useful when you want to perform operations on or analyze all the children of a specific node.
