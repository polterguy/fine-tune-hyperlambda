// This Hyperlambda code iterates over all nodes named "debug" or "trace" within the children of the [.config] node using [for-each]. For each of these nodes, it sets their value to "false" using [set-value], effectively disabling debug and trace configurations. The [.dp] node is used to reference the current node being iterated, allowing the [set-value] slot to modify its value directly.
