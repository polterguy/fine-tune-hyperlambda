/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database using Hyperlambda. It specifies the database type as SQLite and selects data from the "Customers" table, applying a distinct function on the columns. The [where] clause is prepared for additional conditions, but currently, no conditions are specified. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.read] - Initiates a database read operation.
 * 2. [database-type] - Specifies the type of database, in this case, SQLite.
 * 3. [table] - Indicates the table to query, "Customers".
 * 4. [columns] - Defines the columns to be selected.
 * 5. [distinct_functor] - Applies a distinct function on the columns.
 * 6. [as] - Alias for the distinct function result.
 * 7. [where] - Prepares for conditional filtering of the query results.
 * 8. [and] - Placeholder for adding multiple conditions in the where clause.
