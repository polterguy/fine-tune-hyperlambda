/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a signal to a specific session, which is dynamically determined by the expression [x:@.arguments/*/session]. The signal includes an [args] node containing three pieces of information: an [error] node with a boolean value of true, a [status] node that retrieves its value from the result of an [http.post] operation, and a [message] node that extracts a specific error message from the HTTP POST response content. This setup is typically used to notify a client or session about an error condition, along with the status and error message details from an HTTP POST request. 
 * 
 * 1. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to a specific session.
 * 2. [args] - Contains the arguments to be sent with the signal.
 * 3. [error] - Indicates an error condition with a boolean value of true.
 * 4. [status] - Retrieves the status from the result of an HTTP POST request.
 * 5. [message] - Extracts an error message from the HTTP POST response content.
