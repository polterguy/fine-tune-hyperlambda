// This Hyperlambda code uses the [auth.ticket.verify] slot to ensure that the currently authenticated user belongs to at least one of the specified roles: "root", "guest", or "impersonated". If the user does not belong to any of these roles, the slot will throw an exception, effectively preventing unauthorized access to the associated functionality or endpoint. This is typically used in contexts where role-based access control is required to secure resources.
