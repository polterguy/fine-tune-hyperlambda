// This code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to modify the value of the [.greeting] node by replacing newline characters with the string "\\n". The [strings.replace] slot is used to find occurrences of "\n" in the [.greeting] node and substitute them with "\\n". This is useful for escaping newline characters in strings.
set-value:x:@.greeting
   strings.replace:x:@.greeting
