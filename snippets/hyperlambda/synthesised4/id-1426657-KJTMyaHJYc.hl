 * This Hyperlambda code decodes a URL-encoded string. It first retrieves the second element from a split string operation (presumably a URL-encoded string) and then URL-decodes it, setting the result as the value of the [.url] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.url] node.
 * 2. [strings.url-decode] - Decodes a URL-encoded string.
 * 3. [strings.split] - Retrieves the second element from a split string operation.
