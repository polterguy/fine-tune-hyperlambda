// The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [remove-nodes] slot to delete specific nodes from a parent node's children collection. In this example, the code first defines a [.data] node with three children: [foo1], [foo2], and [foo3]. The [remove-nodes] slot is then used with an expression targeting the [foo2] node within the [.data] node's children. As a result, the [foo2] node is removed from the [.data] node, leaving only [foo1] and [foo3] as its children. This operation showcases how [remove-nodes] can be utilized to dynamically alter the structure of a Hyperlambda graph by removing specific nodes based on expressions.
