// 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name from the current context. In this case, it looks for the first node named ".arguments". This is useful for accessing specific nodes in a structured data set, especially when you want to retrieve a node that is not a direct child but exists somewhere in the hierarchy.
