/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is used to access the arguments passed into a slot or function.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. This is useful for accessing all the arguments provided to a slot or function.
 * 
 * 3. `aggregate_column` - This iterator filters the children nodes of "arguments" to find the first node with the name "aggregate_column". It is used to specifically access the value of the "aggregate_column" argument.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression can be used in a context where you need to dynamically access the "aggregate_column" argument passed to a slot or function, perhaps to perform operations like aggregation or calculation based on the column specified by the user.
