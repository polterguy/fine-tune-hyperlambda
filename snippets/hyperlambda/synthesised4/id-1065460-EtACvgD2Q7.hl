// 1. `@.fields`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "fields" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it should search for a node by name. The `.` before "fields" means it will look for this node at the current level or above in the hierarchy, but not among siblings or descendants. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is expected to be at the same level or higher in the hierarchy, such as when accessing configuration or metadata nodes that are typically defined at the top level of a structure.
