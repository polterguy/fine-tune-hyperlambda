/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node) of the current node. It is used to navigate to the node immediately following the current node in the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access every child node directly under the current node.
 * 
 * 3. `/*` - This iterator again retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access every child node directly under the nodes retrieved by the previous iterator.
 * 
 * 4. `/*` - This iterator once more retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access every child node directly under the nodes retrieved by the previous iterator.
 * 
 * 5. `/content` - This iterator filters the current node set to only include nodes with the name "content". It is used to select nodes specifically named "content" from the current node set.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to navigate to a specific "content" node that is deeply nested within the structure, starting from the elder sibling of the current node. 
 * - It might be useful in a document processing or content management system where specific content nodes need to be accessed and manipulated.
