/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards and sideways in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It acts as a wildcard, selecting every direct child node under [.arguments].
 * 
 * 3. `email` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [email] from the previously selected children nodes. It ensures that only the nodes with the name [email] are returned from the set of children nodes under [.arguments].
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is typically used to extract the [email] node from the [.arguments] node, which is often used in HTTP endpoints to retrieve email data passed as an argument. This is useful for processing or validating email information provided in a request.
