/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to locate the arguments section of a Hyperlambda function or endpoint, which is where input parameters are usually defined.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument defined within the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `end`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "end" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target an argument named "end" if it exists.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function to retrieve the value of an input parameter named "end" that is passed to the function. This is useful in scenarios where the function needs to perform operations based on the value of this specific parameter, such as determining the end point of a range or loop.
