// This code snippet uses the [lambda2hyper] slot to convert a lambda object, specifically the result of an [http.get] operation, into a Hyperlambda string. The [lambda2hyper] slot takes a lambda object as input and outputs its textual Hyperlambda representation, allowing for easy transfer or storage of the lambda structure. The expression [x:@http.get] indicates that the conversion is applied to the result of the [http.get] operation.
lambda2hyper:x:@http.get
