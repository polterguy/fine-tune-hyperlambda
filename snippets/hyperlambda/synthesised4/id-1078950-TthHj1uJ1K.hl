/*
 * 1. `@data.read`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "data.read" in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further navigation within the node structure. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate data specifically under the "data.read" node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.read" node. It allows you to access every direct child node under "data.read", which is useful for iterating over or processing multiple data entries stored under this node.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of each node returned by the previous `*` iterator. This effectively allows you to access the grandchildren of the "data.read" node, enabling deeper traversal into the node hierarchy.
 * 
 * 4. `vector_model`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "vector_model". It is used to pinpoint specific nodes of interest within the hierarchy, allowing you to focus on nodes that contain vector model data.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a machine learning application to retrieve all vector model configurations stored under a "data.read" node, which might be part of a larger data processing or model training pipeline.
 * - It could also be useful in a data analysis context where you need to extract and analyze vector model data from a structured dataset.
