/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to determine the type of a node's value. It first declares a node named [.foo] with an integer value of 57. Then, it uses the [type] slot to retrieve the type of the value of the node directly above it, which is [.foo]. The result of the [type] invocation will be "int", indicating that the value of [.foo] is of type integer.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type of the value of the node directly above it.
