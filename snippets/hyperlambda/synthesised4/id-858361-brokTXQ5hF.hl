// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between tables, specifically joining the "clients" table with an alias "client_id" to the "opportunities" table based on matching "client_id" fields. The join is specified as a left join, which means all records from the "opportunities" table will be returned, along with matched records from the "clients" table, or null if no match is found. The use of the alias allows for clearer referencing of the "clients" table within the join condition.
