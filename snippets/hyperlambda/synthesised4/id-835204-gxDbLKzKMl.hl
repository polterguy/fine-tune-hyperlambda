/*
 * The code uses the [or] slot to evaluate multiple conditions, returning true if any of them are true. It checks if a node named [private] is true, if a string contains "/workflows/workflows/", if it starts with "/modules/", or if it contains "/workflows/" but not "/workflows/actions/" and does not start with "/system/workflows/". The [and] and [not] slots are used for more complex logical checks within the [or] conditions.
 * 
 * 1. [or] - Evaluates to true if any of its child conditions are true.
 * 2. [eq] - Checks if the [private] node is true.
 * 3. [strings.contains] - Checks if the string contains "/workflows/workflows/".
 * 4. [strings.starts-with] - Checks if the string starts with "/modules/".
 * 5. [and] - Groups conditions that must all be true together.
 * 6. [strings.contains] - Checks if the string contains "/workflows/".
 * 7. [not] - Negates the following condition.
 * 8. [strings.contains] - Checks if the string does not contain "/workflows/actions/".
 * 9. [not] - Negates the following condition.
 * 10. [strings.starts-with] - Checks if the string does not start with "/system/workflows/".
