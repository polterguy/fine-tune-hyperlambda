// The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression. In this example, the expression navigates through a complex node structure, starting from the [.dp] node, de-referencing its value, then accessing its children, filtering by name with "src", and finally selecting the first node in the resulting set.
get-value:x:"@.dp/#/*/\\@src/[0,1]"
