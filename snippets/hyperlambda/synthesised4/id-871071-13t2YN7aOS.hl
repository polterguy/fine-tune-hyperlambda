// This Hyperlambda code snippet converts a Hyperlambda text into a lambda object, then back to Hyperlambda text while preserving comments. The [set-value] slot assigns the result to the [.hl] node. [lambda2hyper] transforms the lambda object back to text, and [hyper2lambda] initially parses the text into a lambda structure. The [comments] argument ensures comments are retained during the transformation.
