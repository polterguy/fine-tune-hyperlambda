/*
 * 1. `@xml2lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "xml2lambda". It starts the search from the current node's context and looks for a node with this specific name. This is useful when you want to access a specific node in your Hyperlambda structure that is named "xml2lambda".
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "xml2lambda" node. It is used to access the immediate child nodes of the "xml2lambda" node, regardless of their names. This is useful when you need to perform operations on or analyze all direct children of a particular node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of each child node obtained from the previous `*` iterator. It allows you to access the grandchildren of the "xml2lambda" node. This is useful for operations that require traversing deeper into the node hierarchy, such as extracting specific data or performing transformations on nested structures.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to access and manipulate data within a nested XML-like structure that has been converted to a Hyperlambda format, allowing for operations on both direct children and grandchildren of a specific node named "xml2lambda".
