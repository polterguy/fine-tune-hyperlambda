// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specific string within another string. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the string to be replaced, and the second is the replacement string. In this example, it replaces occurrences of the string referenced by [[stream]] with "false" in the string located at [.result]. The use of [[stream]] suggests a dynamic or variable reference, which will be evaluated to determine the actual string to replace.
strings.replace:x:@.result
   .:[[stream]]
   .:false
