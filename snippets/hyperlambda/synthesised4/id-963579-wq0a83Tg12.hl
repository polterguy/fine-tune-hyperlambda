// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to add nodes to a specific location in the node hierarchy. It retrieves nodes using the [get-nodes] slot, specifically targeting nodes within the [.lambda] node, and adds them to the path specified by the expression in the [add] slot. This operation effectively merges nodes from one part of the graph into another.
