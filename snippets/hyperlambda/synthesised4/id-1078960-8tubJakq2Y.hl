/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "signal" from the current context. It starts the traversal from the root or the current node set, looking for a node named "signal".
 * 
 * 2. `@signal` - This second `@signal` iterator again retrieves the first node named "signal" from the children of the node found by the first iterator. This implies there are nested nodes named "signal".
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator. It expands the search to include every child node under the second "signal" node.
 * 
 * 4. `urls` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "urls" from the children retrieved by the `*` iterator. It narrows down the node set to those specifically named "urls".
 * 
 * 5. `0` - This iterator retrieves the first child node of the "urls" node. It assumes that "urls" contains a list or collection of nodes, and it selects the first one.
 * 
 * 6. `-` - This iterator retrieves the younger sibling of the node found by the previous iterator. It moves to the node that is immediately before the first child of "urls" in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to navigate a structured data set where "signal" nodes contain "urls" lists, and you want to access a specific sibling node of the first URL in the list.
 * - It might be useful in scenarios where you need to find metadata or related information that is stored alongside the first URL in a list within a "signal" node.
