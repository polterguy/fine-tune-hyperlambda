// This Hyperlambda code sends a signal to a feedback channel using the [sockets.signal] slot. It constructs a message by concatenating strings and sends it along with a type of "info" to the specified feedback channel. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to transmit messages to connected clients, and the message is dynamically created using the [strings.concat] slot. The feedback channel is determined by evaluating the expression in the [sockets.signal] slot.
