/*
 * 1. `@.session` - This iterator searches for the first node named "session" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It returns the first "session" node it encounters. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that could be located at different levels in the hierarchy, ensuring you always get the closest "session" node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all the children of the "session" node. It is used to access all the immediate child nodes under the "session" node. This can be useful when you want to perform operations on all the data stored within a session, such as iterating over session variables or extracting specific information from the session.
