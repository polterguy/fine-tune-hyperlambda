// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to dynamically add nodes to a destination node's children collection. The [add] slot takes an expression pointing to the destination node, and its children nodes are evaluated before being added. Here, [get-nodes] retrieves nodes from the result of an [execute-file] operation, and these nodes are added to the destination node specified by the expression in [add]. The [add] slot allows for dynamic node manipulation by evaluating and appending nodes to a specified destination.
