// This Hyperlambda code snippet connects to an ODBC data source and executes a SQL query to select all columns from the "orders" table. The results are ordered by the "created_at" column in descending order, and the query is limited to return only the top 5 records.
odbc.select:select * from orders order by created_at desc limit 5
