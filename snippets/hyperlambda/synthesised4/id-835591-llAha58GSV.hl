// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of all nodes referenced by its main expression to the value obtained from the [get-value] slot, which retrieves the value of the [group_column] node within the [arguments] node. The [set-name] slot is used to rename nodes, and the expression [x:+/*/*] targets specific nodes in the hierarchy.
set-name:x:+/*/*
