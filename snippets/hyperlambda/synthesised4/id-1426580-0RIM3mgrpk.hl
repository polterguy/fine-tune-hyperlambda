// This Hyperlambda code connects to a MySQL database and executes a SQL statement loaded from a file. The [mysql.connect] slot establishes a connection to the database, while the [mysql.execute] slot executes the SQL statement obtained from the [io.file.load] slot, which reads the content of a specified file. The code effectively allows for executing SQL commands stored in external files, facilitating dynamic database operations.
mysql.connect
