// This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL query to count the number of entries in the "ml_requests" table. It uses the [data.read] slot to specify the table and the [columns] slot to define the aggregation function "count(*)", which is aliased as "count". The [where] clause is prepared for additional conditions but currently does not specify any. The [limit] slot restricts the result to a single record, ensuring only the count is returned.
