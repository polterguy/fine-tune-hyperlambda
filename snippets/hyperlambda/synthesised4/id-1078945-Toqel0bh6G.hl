/*
 * 1. `@http` - This iterator searches for the first ancestor node named "http". It is used to locate a specific node in the hierarchy that is named "http". This is useful when you want to find a node that is higher up in the hierarchy and is named "http".
 * 
 * 2. `post` - This iterator looks for a child node named "post" under the node found by the previous iterator. It is used to locate a specific child node named "post" under the "http" node. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the "post" node that is a child of the "http" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access or manipulate the "post" node within an "http" node, such as when configuring or handling HTTP POST requests in a Hyperlambda application.
