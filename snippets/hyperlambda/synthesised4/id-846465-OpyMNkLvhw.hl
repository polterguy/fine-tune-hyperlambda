// The [and] slot in Hyperlambda is used for logical conjunction, requiring two or more arguments. It evaluates to true only if all its arguments are true. It short-circuits upon encountering a false condition, skipping subsequent evaluations. This slot is useful for constructing complex logical conditions by evaluating all arguments before determining the overall truth value.
