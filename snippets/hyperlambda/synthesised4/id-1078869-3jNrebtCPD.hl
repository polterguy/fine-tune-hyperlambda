/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is used to locate the `.arguments` node, which typically contains input parameters or arguments for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access all the arguments or parameters that are passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `/token` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `token`. It is used to specifically locate the `token` node among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in an authentication or authorization process where a `token` is passed as an argument to verify a user's identity or permissions.
 * - It could be used in API requests to extract a `token` parameter for further processing or validation.
