/*
 * 1. `@.bars` - This iterator searches for the first node named "bars" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first matching node it encounters.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node found by the previous iterator. It will return all direct children of the "bars" node. 
 * 
 * This expression is useful when you need to access all child nodes of a specific parent node named "bars" in a hierarchical data structure.
