/*
 * This expression is a lambda expression in Hyperlambda, and it consists of a single iterator. Below is a detailed explanation of the iterator used in the expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@lambda2hyper`: This iterator searches for the first node in the current context that has the name "lambda2hyper". It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy to find the first occurrence of a node with this specific name. This iterator is useful when you need to reference a specific node by its name within the current node structure, especially if the node is not a direct child or sibling but exists somewhere in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access or manipulate the "lambda2hyper" node, perhaps to retrieve its value or to apply some operation on it, within a larger Hyperlambda script where the node structure is complex and the node is not directly accessible.
