/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet modifies the value of the [completion] node by prepending a newline character to its existing value. It uses the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate a newline character with the current value of [completion], effectively updating [completion] to include the newline at the beginning. The [set-value] slot is used to apply this change to the [completion] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Initiates a case block for conditional branching.
 * 2. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 3. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 4. [.] - Represents a static value, in this case, a newline character.
 * 5. [get-value] - Retrieves the current value of the [completion] node.
