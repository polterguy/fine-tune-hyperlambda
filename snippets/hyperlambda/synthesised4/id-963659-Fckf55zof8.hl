// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.create] slot to insert a new record into the "customers" table with the name "Alice". The [table] slot specifies the target table, while the [values] slot contains the column-value pairs for the new record. The operation is designed to prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries.
data.create
   table:customers
   values
      name:Alice
