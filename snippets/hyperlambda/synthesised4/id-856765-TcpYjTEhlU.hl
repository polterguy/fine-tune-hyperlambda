// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement to execute conditional logic based on the value of a node. It checks the value of [.input] and executes the corresponding [case] block if the value matches. The [default] block is executed if no [case] matches. This allows for efficient branching based on multiple potential values.
