/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot for conditional branching. It evaluates the value of the [input] node and executes the corresponding [case] block if a match is found. If no match is found, the [default] block is executed. This structure is useful for executing different code paths based on the value of a variable.
 * 
 * 1. [input] - Node containing the value to be evaluated in the switch-case structure.
 * 2. [switch] - Slot that initiates the conditional branching based on the value of [input].
 * 3. [case] - Slot that checks if the [input] value matches its own value and executes its children if true.
 * 4. [default] - Slot that executes its children if no [case] matches the [input] value.
