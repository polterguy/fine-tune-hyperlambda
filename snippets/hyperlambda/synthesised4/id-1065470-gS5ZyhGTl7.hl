// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator looks for the first node named "sql" within the current context. The `@` character indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it starts the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate a specific node named "sql" that exists within the current node hierarchy.
