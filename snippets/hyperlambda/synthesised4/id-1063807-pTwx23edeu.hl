/*
 * 1. `@io.file.list` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "io.file.list" in the current context. It starts the search from the root of the current node structure and moves downwards, looking for the first occurrence of a node with this specific name.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "io.file.list" node. Once the "io.file.list" node is found, this iterator will gather all of its direct children, regardless of their names or values. This is useful for processing or iterating over all elements contained within a parent node, such as when you want to list all files in a directory represented by "io.file.list".
