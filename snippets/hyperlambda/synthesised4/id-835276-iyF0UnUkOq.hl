/*
 * This code checks if a given string contains only numeric characters and a dot by using [strings.replace-not-of] to filter out non-numeric characters. If the filtered string equals the original, it sets [.found] to true. The [if] condition uses [not] and [eq] to perform this comparison. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Evaluates a condition and executes its child nodes if true.
 * 2. [not] - Negates the result of its child condition.
 * 3. [eq] - Compares two values for equality.
 * 4. [strings.replace-not-of] - Replaces non-numeric characters in a string.
 * 5. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a node.
 * 6. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 7. [set-value] - Sets the value of a node.
