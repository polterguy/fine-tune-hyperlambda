// This Hyperlambda code constructs a URL by concatenating parts of a split string. It uses [set-value] to assign a value to [.domain], where [strings.concat] combines the first part of the split string with "://" and the second part of the split string. The [get-value] slots retrieve specific parts of the string split by [strings.split].
set-value:x:@.domain
   strings.concat
      get-value:x:@strings.split/0
      .://
      get-value:x:@strings.split/1
