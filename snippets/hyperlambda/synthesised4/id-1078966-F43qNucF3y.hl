/*
 * 1. `@.api-key`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "api-key" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. The `@` symbol is used to find a node by name, and the `.` indicates that the search is limited to the current level or upwards in the hierarchy, not traversing siblings. This is useful when you need to access configuration or sensitive information like an API key that is defined earlier in the node structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving an API key for authentication purposes in a script where the key is defined at a higher level in the hierarchy.
 * - Accessing configuration settings that are defined once and used in multiple places within the same Hyperlambda script.
