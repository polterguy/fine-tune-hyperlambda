// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of all [result] nodes found under the [return] nodes in the parent directory to false. The [set-value] slot is used to change the values of nodes, and the expression "../*/return/*/result" specifies the path to the nodes whose values are to be modified. The static value assigned is a boolean false.
