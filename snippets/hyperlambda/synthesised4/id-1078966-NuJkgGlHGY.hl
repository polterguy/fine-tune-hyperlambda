/*
 * 1. `@data.read` - This iterator searches for the first node named `data.read` in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy until it finds the first matching node. This is useful when you want to access a specific node that might be located higher up in the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `data.read` node. It is used to access any node directly under `data.read`, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of each child node found by the previous `*` iterator. This allows you to access nodes that are two levels deep under the `data.read` node.
 * 
 * 4. `api_key` - This iterator filters the nodes retrieved by the previous iterators to only include those named `api_key`. It is used to specifically target nodes that contain API keys.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract API keys from a configuration or data structure where `data.read` contains multiple entries, each with their own set of attributes, including `api_key`.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to iterate over a collection of data sources or services, each identified by an `api_key`, to perform authentication or data retrieval tasks.
