/*
 * This Hyperlambda code splits a URL string into its components by using "://" as the delimiter. The [strings.split] slot takes a URL from the [.arguments] node and separates it into parts, removing the "://" sequence from the resulting node set. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.split] - Splits a string into multiple parts based on a specified delimiter.
 * 2. [x:@.arguments/*/url] - Points to the URL string within the [.arguments] node to be split.
 * 3. [.:"://"] - Specifies the delimiter "://" for splitting the URL string.
