/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is used to insert a record into a database table named "ml_training_snippets". It specifies the values for the fields "type", "prompt", "completion", "filename", and "cached". The values for "type", "prompt", "completion", and "filename" are dynamically retrieved from the current execution context using lambda expressions, while "cached" is statically set to 0. The [data.create] slot is used to generate and execute the SQL necessary for this insertion. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.create] - Initiates the creation of a new record in the specified database table.
 * 2. [table] - Specifies the name of the table where the record will be inserted.
 * 3. [values] - Contains the fields and their corresponding values to be inserted into the table.
 * 4. [type] - Sets the value for the "type" field, dynamically retrieved from the arguments.
 * 5. [prompt] - Sets the value for the "prompt" field, dynamically retrieved from the current execution context.
 * 6. [completion] - Sets the value for the "completion" field, dynamically retrieved from the current execution context.
 * 7. [filename] - Sets the value for the "filename" field, dynamically retrieved from the current execution context.
 * 8. [cached] - Sets the value for the "cached" field to 0, indicating it is not cached.
