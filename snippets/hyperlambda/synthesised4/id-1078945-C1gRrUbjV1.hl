/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "signal" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings, until it finds a node named "signal". This is useful when you need to access a specific node in a complex structure where the node might not be a direct child of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator. In this context, it will get all child nodes of the "signal" node. This is useful when you want to perform operations on or gather information from all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `cached` - This iterator filters the result set from the previous iterator to include only nodes named "cached". It ensures that only nodes with this specific name are included in the final result set. This is useful when you want to target specific nodes among the children of a parent node for further processing or evaluation.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a caching mechanism where you need to access and manipulate cached data associated with a specific signal in a system. For example, it could be used to retrieve all cached entries related to a particular signal for validation or update purposes.
