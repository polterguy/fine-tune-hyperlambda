/*
 * This Hyperlambda code iterates over each node under [car-parts] using [for-each]. For each node, it checks if its value is "available" using [if] and [eq]. If true, it sets the value to "checked" using [set-value]. If not, it retrieves the node's name with [get-name] and checks if it's "wheel". If it is, it sets the value to "urgent restock"; otherwise, it sets the value to "restock". 
 * 
 * 1. [for-each] - Iterates over each node under [car-parts].
 * 2. [if] - Checks if the current node's value is "available".
 * 3. [eq] - Compares the current node's value to "available".
 * 4. [set-value] - Sets the current node's value to "checked" if available.
 * 5. [get-name] - Retrieves the name of the current node.
 * 6. [if] - Checks if the node's name is "wheel".
 * 7. [eq] - Compares the node's name to "wheel".
 * 8. [set-value] - Sets the node's value to "urgent restock" if it's a wheel.
 * 9. [set-value] - Sets the node's value to "restock" if it's not a wheel.
