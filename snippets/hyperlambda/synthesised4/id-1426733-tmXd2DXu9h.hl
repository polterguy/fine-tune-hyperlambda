/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node. It retrieves the value from a specific path using [get-value] and assigns it to the [.model] node. The [set-value] slot is used to modify the value of the [.model] node by setting it to the value retrieved from the [get-value] expression. The [get-value] slot navigates through the node structure to access the desired value from the [data.read] node's children.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.model] node.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value from the specified path within the [data.read] node.
