/*
 * This Hyperlambda code performs a series of operations involving string concatenation, value retrieval, type conversion, and node removal. It first concatenates a session value with a fixed value, then converts this concatenated result into a type, and finally removes nodes based on the converted result. The steps are as follows:
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Begins an else block, typically executed if a preceding if condition is false.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates the session value with a fixed value.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value from a node named "fixed".
 * 4. [set-x] - Sets the result of the concatenation and conversion into a node for further processing.
 * 5. [convert] - Converts the concatenated string into a specific type.
 * 6. [remove-nodes] - Removes nodes based on the result of the conversion.
