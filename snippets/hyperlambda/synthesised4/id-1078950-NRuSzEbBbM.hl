/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is expected to be present in the current execution context, often used to access data passed by reference in loops or dynamic slots.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is itself a node, allowing you to work directly with the referenced node rather than a copy. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to modify or access the original node's children or properties.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node returned by the previous iterator. It is used to access the direct descendants of a node, which is useful when you need to perform operations on all child nodes or search for specific nodes among them.
 * 
 * 4. `distance` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "distance" from the previous result set. It is used to pinpoint specific nodes by name, allowing for precise data retrieval or manipulation within a larger set of nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include calculating or processing distances in a dataset where each ".dp" node represents a data point with a "distance" attribute. This could be useful in applications involving geolocation, pathfinding, or any domain where distance measurements are relevant.
