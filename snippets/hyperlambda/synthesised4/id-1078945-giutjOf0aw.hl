/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name that appears before the current node in the hierarchy. In this case, it looks for the first node named "tmp". This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is not a direct child or sibling but appears earlier in the structure.
 * 
 * Use case: If you have a complex Hyperlambda structure and you need to access a node named "tmp" that is defined earlier in the hierarchy, this expression will help you retrieve it efficiently.
