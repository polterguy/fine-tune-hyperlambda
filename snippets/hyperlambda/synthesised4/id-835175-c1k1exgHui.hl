// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to append the result of a recursive file listing operation to the [.result] node. The [io.file.list-recursively] slot is used to list all files within the "/misc/workflows/actions/" directory, including files in subdirectories. The result of this operation is added to the [.result] node, effectively aggregating the file paths from the specified directory into the existing content of [.result].
