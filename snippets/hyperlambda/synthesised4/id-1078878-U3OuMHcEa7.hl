/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It is useful for pinpointing a specific node when you know its name but not its exact location in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "hyper2lambda" node. It is useful when you want to access or manipulate all direct descendants of a node without specifying their names.
 * 
 * 3. `.arguments` - This iterator looks for a node named ".arguments" among the children of the "hyper2lambda" node. It is typically used in the context of HTTP endpoints or slots to define or access arguments passed to them.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the ".arguments" node. It allows you to access or manipulate all argument nodes defined within the ".arguments" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract or manipulate all argument nodes defined within a specific "hyper2lambda" node, which might be part of an HTTP endpoint or a dynamically created slot. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to validate, log, or process input arguments for a specific functionality encapsulated within the "hyper2lambda" node.
