// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-name] slot to change the name of nodes. It retrieves the value from the [slot] node under [.arguments] and uses it to rename all nodes named [foo] within the parent node's children. The [set-name] slot allows for dynamic renaming based on the value retrieved, enabling flexible node manipulation within a Hyperlambda graph.
set-name:x:../*/foo
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/slot
