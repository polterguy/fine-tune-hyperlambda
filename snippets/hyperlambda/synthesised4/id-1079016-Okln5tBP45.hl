/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda) of its previous result set. It is used to move downwards in the hierarchy of nodes at the same level. This can be useful when you want to access the subsequent node in a sequence of sibling nodes.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access the child nodes of the current node, allowing you to navigate deeper into the hierarchy of nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to navigate from a current node to its next sibling and then retrieve all children of that sibling. It can be useful in scenarios where you need to process or evaluate all child nodes of a specific sibling node in a sequence.
