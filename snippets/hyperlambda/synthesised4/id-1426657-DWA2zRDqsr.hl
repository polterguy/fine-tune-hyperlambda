/*
 * // The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [strings.replace] slot in Hyperlambda to replace occurrences of a newline character "\n" with a space " " within a string. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first argument specifies the substring to be replaced, and the second argument specifies the replacement string. In this example, the newline characters in the string referenced by [.anchor] are replaced with spaces, effectively removing line breaks and joining the text into a single line.
 * // 1. [strings.replace] - Initiates the string replacement operation.
 * // 2. [@.anchor] - References the string node where the replacement will occur.
 * // 3. [".\n"] - Specifies the substring to be replaced, which is a newline character.
 * // 4. [". "] - Specifies the replacement string, which is a space character.
