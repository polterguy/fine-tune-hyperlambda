/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot in Hyperlambda to retrieve the type of a node's value. It first declares a node [.foo] with an integer value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to obtain the type of the value of the node directly above it, which is [.foo]. After execution, the [type] slot will hold the value "int", indicating that the type of [.foo] is an integer.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type name of the node's value directly above it.
