/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint in Hyperlambda. This is crucial for obtaining input data that the function or endpoint needs to process.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access all the parameters or arguments that have been passed to the function or endpoint. This allows for dynamic handling of multiple arguments.
 * 
 * 3. `user_id` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name [user_id]. It is used to specifically target the argument or parameter named "user_id" from the list of arguments. This is useful when you need to perform operations or checks specifically on the user_id parameter.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a user ID from the arguments passed to an HTTP endpoint to perform user-specific operations, such as fetching user details or validating user access.
 * - Accessing the user_id in a dynamic slot to apply logic based on the user's identity, such as personalized content delivery or user-specific data processing.
