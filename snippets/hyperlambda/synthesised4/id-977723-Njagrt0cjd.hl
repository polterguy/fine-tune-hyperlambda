// This Hyperlambda code snippet is part of a switch-case structure. It checks if a given value matches "foo" and, if so, sets the value of the [.result] node to "Success!". The [case] node is used to define a condition within a [switch] block, and [set-value] is used to assign a new value to a node when the condition is met.
case:foo
   set-value:x:@.result
      .:Success!
