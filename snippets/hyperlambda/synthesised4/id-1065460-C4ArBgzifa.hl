// 1. `@.no`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings but only looks at direct ancestors up in the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is an ancestor of the current node, ensuring that you are referencing a node that is structurally above the current context in your Hyperlambda graph.
