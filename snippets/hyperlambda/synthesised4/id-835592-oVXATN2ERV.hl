/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to modify the value of a node using the [set-value] slot. It concatenates the current value of the [.sql] node with a static string ") as keyword_count" using the [strings.concat] slot, effectively appending this string to the existing SQL statement or query stored in [.sql]. This operation is useful for dynamically building or modifying SQL queries by appending additional clauses or expressions.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.sql] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates the current value of [.sql] with a static string.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the current value of the [.sql] node.
 * 4. [.] - Represents the static string ") as keyword_count" to be appended.
