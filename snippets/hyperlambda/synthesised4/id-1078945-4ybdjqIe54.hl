/*
 * 1. `@.finish_reason`: This iterator starts with an `@`, which means it will search for the first node with the name "finish_reason" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. This is useful when you need to find a specific node that might be located higher up in the hierarchy, such as when checking the reason for the completion of a process or operation in a larger workflow or decision tree. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you want to determine why a particular operation or task was completed, allowing you to handle different completion reasons differently, such as logging, triggering alerts, or branching logic based on the reason for completion.
