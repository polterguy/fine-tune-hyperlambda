/*
 * 1. `@.urls` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "urls" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. It is used to locate the specific node in the hierarchy where the URLs are stored.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "urls" node. It is used to access each individual URL node within the "urls" collection.
 * 
 * 3. `={@.url}` - This is a value comparison iterator. It retrieves nodes from the previous result set (children of "urls") that have a value equal to the value of the node named "url" found in the current context. This effectively filters the list of URL nodes to those that match the specified URL value.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to find a specific URL within a list of URLs stored under a node named "urls". It would be useful in scenarios where you need to verify the presence of a particular URL in a collection or perform operations on a specific URL node.
