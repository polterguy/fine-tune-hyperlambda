/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [log.timeshift] slot to adjust the timestamp of a log entry. The log entry message "Lead was generated" is specified, indicating that the timestamp associated with this log entry will be modified. This is useful for scenarios where log entries need to be aligned with specific events or adjusted for time zone differences. The [log.timeshift] slot allows for precise control over log entry timestamps, ensuring accurate chronological representation of events in the log system.
