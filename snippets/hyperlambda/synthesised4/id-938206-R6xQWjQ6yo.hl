// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [convert] slot to change the type of a node's value to a "short" integer. The [convert] slot takes an expression pointing to the node to be converted, and the [type] node specifies the target type. In this example, the value of the current node is converted to a "short" integer type.
convert:x:-
   type:short
