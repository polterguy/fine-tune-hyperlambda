// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda to evaluate an expression before reaching the node where it's referenced. The [unwrap] slot is used to forward evaluate expressions, allowing the value of a node to be determined before the node is actually executed. In this example, the expression is evaluated using the [unwrap] slot with a specific expression syntax. The [unwrap] slot facilitates the evaluation of expressions within a lambda object, enabling dynamic value assignment and manipulation before execution.
