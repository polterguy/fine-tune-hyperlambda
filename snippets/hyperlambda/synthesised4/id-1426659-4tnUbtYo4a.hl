// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [prompt] exists, is not null, and has a length greater than 0, and simultaneously verifies the existence and non-null status of a node named [completion]. The [and] slot ensures all these conditions must be true for the overall expression to evaluate to true. The code is useful for validating that both [prompt] and [completion] nodes are present and contain meaningful data.
