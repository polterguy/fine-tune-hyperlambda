// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named "session" exists within the children of the [.arguments] node and ensures that this "session" node is not null. It uses the [and] slot to combine two conditions: [exists] to verify the presence of the "session" node, and [not-null] to confirm that the "session" node has a non-null value. If both conditions are true, the entire expression evaluates to true.
