// The code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes to a specific location in a Hyperlambda graph. It uses the [add] slot to insert nodes obtained from the [get-nodes] slot. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node, and these nodes are then added to the path specified by the expression in the [add] slot. This operation effectively copies nodes from one part of the graph to another.
