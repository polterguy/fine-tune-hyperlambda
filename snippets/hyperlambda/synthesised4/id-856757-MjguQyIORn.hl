// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes to a specified node set. It utilizes the [add] slot to append new nodes, [prompt] and [completion], to the node set referenced by the expression in its value. The [prompt] and [completion] nodes are dynamically created using expressions that interpolate values from the [.arguments] node, specifically targeting the "prompt" and "completion" arguments to construct their paths. This allows for flexible and dynamic construction of node paths based on input arguments.
