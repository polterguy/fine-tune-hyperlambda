/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current hierarchy. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot, especially in the context of HTTP endpoints or dynamic slots.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any arguments that might be passed as children to the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `prompt` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `prompt` from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically access the `prompt` argument passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or HTTP endpoint to retrieve the value of a `prompt` argument passed to it. This is useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically process or respond based on the `prompt` provided by the user or another system.
