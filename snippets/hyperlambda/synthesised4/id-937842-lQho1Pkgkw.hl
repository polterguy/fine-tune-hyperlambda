// The code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "items" and "products", using Hyperlambda. The join is based on matching the "product_id" columns from both tables, with the "products" table being aliased as "product_id". The use of the "and" slot ensures that the join condition is met for the specified columns.
