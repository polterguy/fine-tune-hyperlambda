 * 1. `@` - This iterator searches for the first node with the specified name in the current context or hierarchy. In this case, it looks for a node named "similar".
 * 2. `.similar` - This specifies the exact name of the node to be found. It is used in conjunction with the `@` iterator to locate the node named "similar" within the current scope.
 * 
 * Potential use case:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve a node named "similar" from the current context, which might be useful in scenarios where you need to access or manipulate data related to similarity, such as finding similar items in a list or comparing attributes.
