/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node named "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, and the `.` symbol indicates that it will start the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate the "sql" node within the current execution scope, such as executing an SQL query or modifying SQL-related data. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving an SQL query or command stored in a node named "sql" for execution.
 * - Modifying or analyzing SQL-related data within a Hyperlambda script.
