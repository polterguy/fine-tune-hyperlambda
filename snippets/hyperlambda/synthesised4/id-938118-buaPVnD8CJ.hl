// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to specify the type of join in a SQL query using the [type] slot. By setting [type] to "inner", it indicates that the join operation between tables should be an inner join, which returns only the rows with matching values in both tables. This is typically used in conjunction with [join] slots to define relationships between tables in a database query.
