// This Hyperlambda code performs an HTTP PUT request to upload a file to a specified URL. It uses the [http.put] slot with a [filename] argument to directly transmit the file "/documents/README.md" without loading it into memory. The [timeout] argument is set to 30 seconds, specifying the maximum duration to wait for the request to complete before aborting.
http.put:"https://api.example.com/upload/README"
   filename:/documents/README.md
