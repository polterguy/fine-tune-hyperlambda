// This Hyperlambda code constructs a SQL delete statement by concatenating strings and values. It uses [set-value] to assign a constructed SQL string to the [.sql] node. The [strings.concat] slot combines a static SQL delete statement with the result of a [get-value] operation, which retrieves values from a [data.read] node, forming a complete SQL query to delete rows based on specific row IDs.
