/*
 * 1. `@data.connect`: This iterator searches for the first node named `data.connect` in the current context. It starts from the root or the current node and looks for a node with this specific name. This is useful when you want to locate a specific node in a potentially large and complex graph structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `data.connect` node. It is used to access every child node directly under `data.connect`, regardless of their names. This is helpful when you need to perform operations on all children of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `data.read` among the children of `data.connect`. It allows you to narrow down the selection to nodes of interest, which in this case are nodes named `data.read`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to read data from a specific connection. By locating `data.connect` and then accessing its `data.read` nodes, you can perform read operations on the data source connected through `data.connect`.
 * - It might be used in a logging or monitoring system to track data read operations from a specific connection point, allowing for auditing or debugging purposes.
