/*
 * 1. `@.words` - This iterator starts by finding the first node with the name "words" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that it will start the search from the current node's context.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "words" node found in the previous step. The `*` symbol is used to access all direct children of a node, allowing for operations or evaluations on each child node individually. This is useful for iterating over or processing each child node under "words".
