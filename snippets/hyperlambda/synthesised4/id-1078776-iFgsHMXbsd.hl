/*
 * The expression `@io.stream.read` is a lambda expression that uses the `@` iterator to find a node with the name `io.stream.read`. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@` - This iterator searches for the first node with the specified name in the current context or scope. It does not traverse siblings but looks for the node in the current hierarchy level or its ancestors.
 * 
 * 2. `io.stream.read` - This is the name of the node that the `@` iterator is searching for. It suggests that the node is related to reading from an input/output stream, possibly a file or network stream.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression could include:
 * 
 * - Reading data from a file or network stream in a Hyperlambda application.
 * - Accessing a node that contains logic or configuration for handling input/output operations in a Hyperlambda script.
