// This Hyperlambda code logs an error message with the content "Something went wrong while invoking Twilio" and includes the response from a previous operation, converted into a Hyperlambda string using the [lambda2hyper] slot. The [log.error] slot is used to record error messages, and the [response] node captures the output of the [lambda2hyper] conversion, which transforms a lambda object into a Hyperlambda string for logging purposes.
log.error:Something went wrong while invoking Twilio
   response:x:@lambda2hyper
