/*
 * 1. `@.lhs`: This iterator looks for the first node named "lhs" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first match it finds. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node that is an ancestor or a sibling of an ancestor, ensuring that you are always working with the correct node in a potentially complex structure.
 * 
 * 2. `#`: This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the node is another node itself, allowing you to work directly with that node. This is particularly useful when the node's value is a reference to another node, and you want to manipulate or access the contents of that referenced node directly.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a node structure where some nodes contain references to other nodes, and you need to access and possibly modify the referenced node. For example, in a configuration management system, you might have a node that references a configuration value stored elsewhere, and you need to retrieve and update that value.
