// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each product node within an invoice and calculates the line total for each product. The [for-each] slot iterates through each product node, and for each product, the [set-value] slot updates the lineTotal node by multiplying the quantity and unitPrice nodes using the [math.multiply] slot. The [get-value] slot retrieves the values of quantity and unitPrice for the calculation.
