// The [case:smalldatetime] slot is used to handle conditions based on a small datetime value. It allows for conditional branching in Hyperlambda, where specific actions can be executed if the datetime condition matches the specified criteria. This slot is typically used within a [switch] statement to evaluate datetime values and execute corresponding logic.
