// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to modify the value of the [.result] node. It utilizes the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specific substring within the [.result] node. The substring to be replaced is specified by the [[stream]] node, and it is replaced with the string "false". The [set-value] slot ensures that the [.result] node is updated with the modified string.
