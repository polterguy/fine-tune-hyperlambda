/*
 * 1. `@data.connect`: This iterator searches for the first node named `data.connect` in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further navigation within the node structure. This is useful when you want to begin operations from a specific node identified by its name.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the `data.connect` node. It is used to access the next level of nodes within the hierarchy, allowing for operations on multiple nodes beneath the `data.connect` node.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to only those named `data.read`. It is used to narrow down the node set to those that are specifically relevant to data reading operations.
 * 
 * 4. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the `data.read` node. It allows for further navigation into the node hierarchy to access additional nested nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `group`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to only those named `group`. It is used to focus on nodes that represent groups, which might be relevant for operations involving grouped data.
 * 
 * 6. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the `group` node. It is used to access the next level of nodes within the group, allowing for operations on multiple nodes beneath the `group` node.
 * 
 * 7. `group_column`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to only those named `group_column`. It is used to specifically target nodes that represent columns within a group, which might be relevant for operations involving specific data columns.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include navigating a complex data structure to extract or manipulate specific columns within grouped data, such as when processing database query results or organizing data for reporting purposes.
