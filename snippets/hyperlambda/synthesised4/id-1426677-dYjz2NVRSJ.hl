/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds nodes retrieved from a specified location to a target node. The [add] slot is used to append nodes to the node referenced by its expression. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves nodes from the path specified in its expression, which in this case is pointing to all children of the [.arguments] node. The retrieved nodes are then added to the node referenced by the [add] slot's expression. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the specified target node.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the path specified in its expression.
