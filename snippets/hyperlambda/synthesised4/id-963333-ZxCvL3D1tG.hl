// This Hyperlambda code uses the [else] slot to set the value of the [.result] node to "Backup started successfully." The [else] slot is executed only if all preceding [if] and [else-if] conditions evaluate to false, acting as a default action when no other conditions are met. The [set-value] slot assigns the specified string to the [.result] node.
