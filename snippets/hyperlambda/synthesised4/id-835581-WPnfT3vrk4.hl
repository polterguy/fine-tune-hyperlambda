/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet changes the name of nodes within a specific path. It uses [set-name] to rename all nodes under [group] within [data.read] in a [data.connect] context, specifically targeting nodes named [group_column]. The new name for these nodes is derived from the value of [group_column] found in [.arguments]. This operation is useful for dynamically adjusting node names based on input arguments. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the name of nodes specified by its expression.
 * 2. [@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column] - Specifies the nodes to be renamed within the hierarchy.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/group_column] - Retrieves the new name for the nodes from the [.arguments] node.
