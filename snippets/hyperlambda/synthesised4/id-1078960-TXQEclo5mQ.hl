/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator searches for the first node named "signal" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by name within the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "signal" node. It allows access to all direct descendants of the "signal" node.
 * 
 * 3. `found` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "found" among the children of the "signal" node. It is used to pinpoint a specific child node by name.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used in scenarios where you need to verify the presence or status of a "found" node within a "signal" node, such as checking if a particular event or condition has been detected in a signal processing application.
 * - It can also be useful in monitoring systems where you need to confirm the detection of specific signals or alerts.
