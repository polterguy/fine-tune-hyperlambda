// This Hyperlambda code snippet concatenates a base file path with a dynamically retrieved Hyperlambda ID and a file extension to form a complete file path. The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine a static path, a value retrieved from a node using [get-value], and a static file extension. The result is a string that represents the full path to a specific Hyperlambda file.
