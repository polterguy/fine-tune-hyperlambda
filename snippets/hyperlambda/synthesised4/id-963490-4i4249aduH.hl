// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes to a specified destination node. It retrieves nodes from a [return-nodes] path, specifically targeting the [result] nodes, and adds a set of child nodes (title, link, original, source) to each of them. The [add] slot's expression specifies multiple destination nodes, allowing for simultaneous modification of multiple nodes in the graph structure. The [@.dp/#] expression is used to reference the current node being iterated over, ensuring that the correct nodes are targeted for modification.
