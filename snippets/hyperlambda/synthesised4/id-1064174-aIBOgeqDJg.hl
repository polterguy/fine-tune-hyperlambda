 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `group_column` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "group_column" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically access the argument named "group_column" that was passed to the function or slot.
