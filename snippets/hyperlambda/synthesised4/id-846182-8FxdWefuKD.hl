/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [case] slot to handle different conditions based on the value of a variable. The [switch] slot is used to evaluate the value of [character] and execute the corresponding [case] block. If no case matches, the [default] block is executed. This allows for conditional branching based on the value of [character].
 * 
 * 1. [character] - The variable being evaluated in the switch statement.
 * 2. [switch] - Evaluates the value of [character] to determine which case to execute.
 * 3. [case] - Represents a specific condition to match against the value of [character].
 * 4. [default] - Executed if no [case] matches the value of [character].
