/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to access the [.arguments] node, which typically contains input parameters or arguments for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each individual argument or parameter that is passed into the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `limit` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "limit". It is used to specifically access the "limit" argument or parameter, which might be used to control the number of items to process or return.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a function or endpoint to retrieve the "limit" parameter, which might define the maximum number of records to fetch from a database or the maximum number of iterations in a loop.
 * - It could also be used to enforce a limit on the number of results returned by an API endpoint, ensuring that the response is not too large.
