/*
 * The [else-if] slot is used for conditional branching and follows an [if] or another [else-if]. It evaluates its condition only if previous conditions are false. If the condition, in this case, checking if the value of [.src] is equal to 2, evaluates to true, it executes its [.lambda] block, setting the value of [.dest] to "yup2.0!". 
 * 
 * 1. [else-if] - Initiates a conditional check that follows an [if] or another [else-if].
 * 2. [eq] - Compares if two values are equal, used here to check if [.src] equals 2.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.src] - Retrieves the value of the [.src] node.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 5. [set-value:x:@.dest] - Sets the value of [.dest] to "yup2.0!" if the condition is met.
