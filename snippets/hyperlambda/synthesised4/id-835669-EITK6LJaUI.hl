/*
 * This code connects to a SQLite database and performs a read operation on the "campaigns" table. It dynamically adds and removes nodes related to ordering, limiting, and offsetting the query results. The code also incorporates additional conditions from the arguments into the "where" clause of the SQL query. Finally, it returns the nodes from the read operation, effectively retrieving and returning data from the "campaigns" table.
 * 
 * 1. [data.connect] - Establishes a connection to a SQLite database using a specified connection string.
 * 2. [database-type] - Specifies the type of database being connected to, in this case, SQLite.
 * 3. [add] - Adds nodes related to ordering and direction from arguments to the data read operation.
 * 4. [remove-nodes] - Removes nodes related to ordering and direction from the arguments.
 * 5. [add] - Adds nodes related to limit and offset from arguments to the data read operation.
 * 6. [remove-nodes] - Removes nodes related to limit and offset from the arguments.
 * 7. [add] - Incorporates additional conditions from arguments into the "where" clause of the SQL query.
 * 8. [data.read] - Executes a read operation on the "campaigns" table, specifying columns and conditions.
 * 9. [return-nodes] - Returns the nodes from the read operation, effectively retrieving data from the table.
