/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [foo] node inside the [.arguments] node is equal to boolean true. If the condition is met, it logs the message "Condition is true". The [if] slot evaluates the condition using the [eq] slot, and if true, executes the [.lambda] block containing the [log.info] slot.
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Evaluates a condition and executes its [.lambda] child if the condition is true.
 * 2. [eq] - Compares the value of [foo] to boolean true.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 4. [log.info] - Logs the message "Condition is true".
