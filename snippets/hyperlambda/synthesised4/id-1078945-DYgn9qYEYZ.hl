/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it should look for a node by name, and the `.` ensures that it starts from the current node's context and looks upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint, which contains the parameters passed to the function.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. The `*` symbol is a wildcard that selects all direct child nodes, allowing the expression to work with any number of children nodes under `.arguments`.
 * 
 * 3. `/system_message`: This part of the expression filters the result set to only include nodes named `system_message` that are children of the nodes retrieved by the previous `*` iterator. It effectively narrows down the selection to nodes specifically named `system_message`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include accessing a specific parameter named `system_message` from a set of arguments passed to a Hyperlambda function or endpoint. This could be useful in scenarios where the function needs to process or log a system message provided as input.
