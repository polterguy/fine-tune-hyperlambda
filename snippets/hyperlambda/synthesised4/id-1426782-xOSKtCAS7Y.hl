/*
 * /*
 *  * This Hyperlambda code concatenates strings and sets the value of a node. It retrieves the price and permalink from a data node and formats them into a string with labels "Price:" and "URL:", separated by a newline. The formatted string is then assigned to the node referenced by the expression.
 *  * 
 *  * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 *  * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 *  * 3. [.] - Static string "Price: ".
 *  * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node referenced by its expression, in this case, the price.
 *  * 5. [.] - Static string containing a newline character.
 *  * 6. [.] - Static string "URL: ".
 *  * 7. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node referenced by its expression, in this case, the permalink.
