// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda to evaluate a lambda expression. It targets nodes within a specific path, extracting values from a nested structure. The [unwrap] slot processes the expression to retrieve the value of the [url] node located under the [signal] node, which is a child of the current node's children. This operation is useful for dynamically accessing and evaluating nested data structures within a Hyperlambda graph.
unwrap:x:./*/signal/*/url
