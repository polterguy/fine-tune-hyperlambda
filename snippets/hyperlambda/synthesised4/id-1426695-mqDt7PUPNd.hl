/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [return] slot to return a node with a value. The [return] slot is used to exit from a dynamically created slot or a context that supports returning values, and it provides a way to return a structured node or a value. In this example, the [return] slot is used to return a node named [result] with the value "success". This indicates the successful execution of the slot or operation. The [return] slot is crucial for controlling the flow of execution and communicating results in Hyperlambda. The code structure is as follows:
 * 
 * 1. [return] - Initiates the return process, allowing the subsequent nodes to be returned as the result of the execution.
 * 2. [result] - A child node of [return], which contains the value "success", indicating the outcome of the operation.
