/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to declare a node with a specific type and retrieve its type name. The [type] slot is used to obtain the type of the node's value, which in this case is an integer. The [type] slot is invoked with an expression pointing to the node whose type is to be retrieved.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo:int:57] - Declares a node named [.foo] with an integer type and a value of 57.
 * 2. [type:x:-] - Retrieves the type name of the node's value, which is "int" in this case.
