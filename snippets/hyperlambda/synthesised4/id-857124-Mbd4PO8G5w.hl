// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Orders" and "Order Details", using the [join] slot. It specifies an alias for the "Orders" table as "OrderID" and establishes a join condition where the "OrderID" from the "Order Details" table matches the "OrderID" from the "Orders" table. The [type] slot indicates a left join, ensuring all records from the "Orders" table are included, even if there are no matches in the "Order Details" table.
join:Orders
   as:OrderID
   type:left
   on
      and
         Order Details.OrderID:OrderID.OrderID
