// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database using a connection string named "generic" and a database named "magic". It then executes an SQL update statement to increment the "no_requests" field in the "ml_types" table for a specific "type", which is dynamically retrieved from the [.arguments] node. The [data.connect] slot establishes the connection, while [data.execute] performs the SQL operation.
data.connect:[generic|magic]
   data.execute:update ml_types set no_requests = no_requests + 1 where type = @type
      type:x:@.arguments/*/type
