/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "arguments" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the dot before "arguments" means it looks for a node named "arguments" at the current level or higher in the hierarchy, but not among siblings.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "arguments" node found by the previous iterator. The asterisk (*) is used to access every child node directly beneath the "arguments" node, regardless of their names. This is useful for iterating over or accessing all children of a specific parent node.
