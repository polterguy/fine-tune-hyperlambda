/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to convert the value of a node to an integer type. The [convert] slot is used to change the type of the node value pointed to by the expression "x:@data.read/*/*/cached" to an integer. The conversion will only succeed if the original value can be converted to an integer, otherwise, it will throw an exception.
 * 
 * 1. [convert] - Converts the value of the node specified by the expression to a new type.
 * 2. [type] - Specifies the target type for the conversion, in this case, "int".
