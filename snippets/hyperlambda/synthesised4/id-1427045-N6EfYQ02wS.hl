// The [and] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate multiple conditions and returns true only if all conditions are true. It short-circuits, meaning if any condition is false, it doesn't evaluate the remaining conditions. This slot is useful for creating complex logical expressions where all specified conditions must be met for the overall expression to be true.
