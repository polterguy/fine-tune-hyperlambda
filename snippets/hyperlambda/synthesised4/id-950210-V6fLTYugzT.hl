// This code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.result] node. It employs the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a string within the [.result] node. The replacement process uses two values: the "what" string, obtained via [get-value] from the [.dp] node, and the "with" string, also retrieved using [get-value] from the [.dp] node. The [strings.replace] slot performs the substitution, and the result is assigned back to the [.result] node.
