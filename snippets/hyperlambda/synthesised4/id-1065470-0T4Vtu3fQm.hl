// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" at the current level of the hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that it will start from the current context or node. This is useful when you want to directly access a specific node by its name within the current scope, often used when you know the exact node you need to interact with or retrieve data from.
