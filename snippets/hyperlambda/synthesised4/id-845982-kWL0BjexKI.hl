// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of nodes in the current context to "http.xxx", where "xxx" is dynamically constructed by concatenating the string "http." with the value extracted from the [verb] node within the [hyper2lambda] node. The [set-name] slot is used for renaming nodes, and [strings.concat] is used to build the new name.
set-name:x:../*/http.xxx
   strings.concat
