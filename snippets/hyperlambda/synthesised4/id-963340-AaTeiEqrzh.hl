// The code iterates over each text node within the "loc" elements of an XML structure converted to a lambda object using [xml2lambda]. For each text node, it evaluates and unwraps its content, then adds the unwrapped content as a child node to a node named [.urls]. The [for-each] slot is used to loop through the nodes, [unwrap] evaluates expressions, and [add] appends the result to the [.urls] node.
