// The code demonstrates the use of the [fork] slot to execute tasks asynchronously. It creates a new thread to run a sequence of operations, including a [sleep] slot that pauses execution for 1000 milliseconds, followed by a [log.info] slot that logs a message "Second async log". This allows the main thread to continue executing without waiting for these operations to complete.
