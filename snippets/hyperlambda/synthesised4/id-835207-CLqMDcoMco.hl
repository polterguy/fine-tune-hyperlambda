// The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to the specified role, in this case, "root". If the user does not belong to the "root" role, the slot will throw an exception. This slot is typically used in contexts where access control is required, such as securing HTTP endpoints to ensure only users with the appropriate role can access them.
