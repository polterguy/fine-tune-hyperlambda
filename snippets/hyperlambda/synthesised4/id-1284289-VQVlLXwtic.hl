// The expression `unwrap:x:+/*` is used to forward evaluate the children of the node immediately below the current node in the hierarchy. This is particularly useful when you want to dynamically evaluate or manipulate nodes that are siblings of the current node, ensuring that their values or structures are processed before any subsequent operations. A potential use case for this expression could be in scenarios where you have a list of nodes that need to be processed or transformed before being used in further logic, such as aggregating data or preparing a set of nodes for a batch operation.
