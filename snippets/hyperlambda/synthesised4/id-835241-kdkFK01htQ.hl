// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [yield] slot to return multiple values from a dynamic slot or Hyperlambda file. It returns a static result node with the value "success" and a count node with the value obtained from the [get-count] slot, which counts nodes based on its expression.
yield
   result:success
   count:x:@get-count
