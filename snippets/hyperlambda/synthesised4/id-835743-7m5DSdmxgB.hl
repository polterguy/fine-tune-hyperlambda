// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to the result of a [data.connect] and [data.read] operation. It retrieves nodes using [get-nodes] for both [limit] and [offset] from the [.arguments] node, allowing for dynamic inclusion of these parameters in a data connection and reading operation. This approach helps in customizing data queries with pagination controls.
