/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` within the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for the first occurrence of the node with the specified name.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access the direct children of a node, which in this context would be all the arguments provided to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `stream`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name `stream`. It is used to specifically target a node named `stream` among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to access a specific argument named `stream` that is passed to a function or slot. It allows you to retrieve the value of the `stream` argument for further processing or validation within your Hyperlambda code.
