/*
 * The code checks if a specific node, [finish_reason], exists and is not null within a JSON structure converted to a lambda object. If both conditions are true, it unwraps the lambda object and sends a signal through a socket with the [finish_reason] as an argument. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Begins a conditional statement.
 * 2. [and] - Combines multiple conditions that must all be true.
 * 3. [exists] - Checks if the [finish_reason] node exists.
 * 4. [not-null] - Ensures the [finish_reason] node is not null.
 * 5. [.lambda] - Contains the actions to execute if conditions are met.
 * 6. [unwrap] - Evaluates expressions within the lambda object.
 * 7. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal through a socket.
 * 8. [args] - Contains arguments for the socket signal.
 * 9. [finish_reason] - The argument passed with the socket signal.
