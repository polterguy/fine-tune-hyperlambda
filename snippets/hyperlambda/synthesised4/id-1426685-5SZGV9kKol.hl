/*
 * This Hyperlambda code replaces all backticks in the value of the [.greeting] node with the string "${\"`\"}". It uses the [strings.replace] slot to perform the replacement and then updates the [.greeting] node with the new value using the [set-value] slot. The code is useful for escaping backticks in a string. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the [.greeting] node.
 * 2. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a specific substring within the [.greeting] node's value.
 * 3. [.] (first occurrence) - Specifies the substring to be replaced, which is the backtick character.
 * 4. [.] (second occurrence) - Specifies the replacement string, which is "${\"`\"}".
