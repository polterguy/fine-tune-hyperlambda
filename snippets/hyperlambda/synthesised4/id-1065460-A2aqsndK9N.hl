// 1. `@.no` - This iterator looks for the first node named "no" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it should start the search from the current node's position in the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node by name that is not necessarily a direct child of the current node.
