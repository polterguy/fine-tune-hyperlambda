/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [connection-string] node inside the [.arguments] node is neither null nor an empty string. It uses the [and] slot to ensure both conditions are true, and the [not] slot to negate the equality checks, ensuring the [connection-string] is not equal to null or an empty string. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Combines multiple conditions and evaluates to true only if all conditions are true.
 * 2. [not] - Negates the result of its child condition.
 * 3. [eq] - Checks if two values are equal.
 * 4. [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/connection-string] - Retrieves the value of the [connection-string] node inside the [.arguments] node.
 * 5. [.] - Represents a null value.
 * 6. [.:] - Represents an empty string.
