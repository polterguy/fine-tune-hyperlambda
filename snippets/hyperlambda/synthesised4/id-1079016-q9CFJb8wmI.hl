 * 1. `@.extra-tokens`: This iterator searches for the first node named "extra-tokens" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with this specific name starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving configuration or metadata stored in a node named "extra-tokens" to use in further processing or validation.
 * - Accessing additional data or parameters that might be required for a specific operation or function within a Hyperlambda script.
