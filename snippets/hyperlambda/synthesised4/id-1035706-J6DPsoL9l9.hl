/*
 * 1. `@data.read`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "data.read" from the current context. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful when you want to access a specific node by name that might not be a direct child of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the previously selected node(s). In this context, it will retrieve all children of the "data.read" node. This is useful for accessing all elements or nodes contained within a parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: This second `*` iterator retrieves all children of each node returned by the previous `*` iterator. This means it will access the children of each child node of "data.read". This is useful when you need to drill down multiple levels in a hierarchy to access nested data.
