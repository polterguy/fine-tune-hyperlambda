// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement to match a specific value and execute a corresponding action. When the [case] node with the value "time" is matched, the [set-value] slot is invoked to change the value of the [.type] node to "date". This structure is useful for executing different code blocks based on the evaluation of a variable or expression.
case:time
   set-value:x:@.type
      .:date
