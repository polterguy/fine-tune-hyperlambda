// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied with the expression `x:+/**`, which evaluates all nodes from the current node's elder sibling and its descendants. This allows for pre-evaluation of expressions, making it useful when invoking lambda objects with expressions, as it enables forward evaluation of these expressions before the lambda object is executed.
unwrap:x:+/**
