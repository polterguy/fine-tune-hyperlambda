// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate a list of strings into a single string. It combines a static string "[generic|" with the value retrieved from the [database] node within the [.arguments] node, and appends a closing bracket "]" to form a complete string. This approach is useful for dynamically constructing strings based on input arguments.
