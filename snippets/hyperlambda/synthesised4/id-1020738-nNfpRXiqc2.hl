/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. The `@` symbol is used to locate a node by its name, and in this case, it looks for the [.arguments] node, which is typically used to denote the beginning of arguments in a Hyperlambda file or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access the nodes that are directly under the [.arguments] node, which usually contain the individual arguments or parameters passed to the Hyperlambda code.
 * 
 * 3. `user` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [user] among the children of [.arguments]. It is used to specifically target the node that holds information or data related to a "user" argument, if such a node exists.
