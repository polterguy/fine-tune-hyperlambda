 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [case] slot in Hyperlambda to perform conditional logic based on a string value. It shows how to declare a [case] slot with a value of type "varchar" and how to use it in conjunction with a [switch] statement to execute specific logic based on the value of a given node. The example illustrates the flexibility of Hyperlambda in handling string-based conditional branching.
