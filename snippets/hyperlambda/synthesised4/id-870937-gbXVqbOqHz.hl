// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] and [get-name] slots in Hyperlambda. It changes the value of a node's name attribute by setting it to the name of another node. Specifically, [set-value] is used to target a node's name attribute, while [get-name] retrieves the name of the current node being processed in a loop or iteration. This operation effectively renames the node based on its current name, allowing for dynamic updates to node attributes within a graph structure.
