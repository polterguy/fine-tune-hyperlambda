// The Hyperlambda code invokes a dynamic slot named "get.pi" using the [signal] slot. This allows the execution of the "get.pi" slot, which is assumed to have been previously created, potentially returning a value or performing some operation. The [signal] slot is used to execute dynamic slots in Hyperlambda, facilitating modular and reusable code execution without direct references.
signal:get.pi
