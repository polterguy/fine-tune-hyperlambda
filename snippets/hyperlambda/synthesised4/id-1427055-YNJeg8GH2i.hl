// The [and] slot in Hyperlambda is used for logical conjunction, requiring two or more arguments. It evaluates to true only if all its arguments are true. If any argument evaluates to false, [and] short-circuits and returns false immediately, skipping the evaluation of subsequent arguments. This behavior allows it to be used in complex logical expressions, ensuring that all specified conditions are met before proceeding with the execution of dependent code.
