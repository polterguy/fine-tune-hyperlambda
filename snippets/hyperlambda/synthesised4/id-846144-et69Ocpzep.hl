/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [set-value] slot to change the value of the node referenced by [.url] to the value of the node currently iterated by reference, as indicated by [.dp/#]. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node pointed to by [.dp/#], which is then used as the new value for [.url]. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.url] node.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node referenced by [.dp/#].
