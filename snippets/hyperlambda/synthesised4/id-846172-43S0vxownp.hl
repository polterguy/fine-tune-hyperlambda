// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] statement to define a specific condition or value to match against. When the value of the [switch] expression matches the value of a [case], the associated code block is executed. The [nchar] type indicates that the value is treated as a Unicode character string, which is particularly useful for handling multilingual data or special characters. This ensures that the comparison is done accurately for strings that may include non-ASCII characters.
