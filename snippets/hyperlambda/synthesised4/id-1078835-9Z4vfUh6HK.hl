/*
 * This expression is a lambda expression used to navigate a node structure in Hyperlambda. Let's break down each part of the expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@.buffer`: This part of the expression starts by locating the first node named "buffer" at the current level of the hierarchy. The `@` symbol is used to find the first node with the specified name, which in this case is "buffer". It does not traverse siblings, only direct children of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: The asterisk (*) is an iterator that retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "buffer" node. It expands the selection to include every direct child node under "buffer".
 * 
 * 3. `*`: The second asterisk (*) further retrieves all children nodes of each node found in the previous step. This means it will include every grandchild node of the "buffer" node, effectively traversing two levels down from "buffer".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to gather all grandchild nodes of a "buffer" node in a Hyperlambda structure, which might be useful for processing or analyzing nested data structures.
 * - It can be used in scenarios where you need to apply operations or transformations to all grandchild nodes of a specific parent node, such as aggregating data or applying a common configuration.
