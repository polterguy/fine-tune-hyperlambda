/*
 * 1. `@data.select` - This iterator looks for the first node with the name "data.select" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy to find the node. This is useful when you want to access a specific node that might not be a direct child of the current node but exists somewhere in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator. It is used to access all direct children nodes of the "data.select" node. This can be useful when you want to perform operations on every child node of a specific parent node, such as iterating through a list of data entries or processing multiple configuration settings under a common parent node.
