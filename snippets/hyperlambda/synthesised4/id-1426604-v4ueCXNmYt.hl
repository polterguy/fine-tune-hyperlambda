/*
 * The code checks if a [description] node exists within the children of a node referenced by [.dp]. If such a node exists, it unwraps and evaluates the children of the next sibling node, and adds a new [description] node with the same value to the [.prop] node's children. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if a condition is true.
 * 2. [exists] - Evaluates if a [description] node exists within the children of [.dp].
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 4. [unwrap] - Evaluates the children of the next sibling node.
 * 5. [add] - Adds a new [description] node to [.prop]'s children.
 * 6. [.] - Represents the value node for [add].
 * 7. [description] - Sets the value of the new [description] node using the existing [description] node's value.
