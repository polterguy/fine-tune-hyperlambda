/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are directly under the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `to` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "to". It is used to specifically access the argument node named "to".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve the value of an argument named "to" that was passed into a Hyperlambda function or slot. For example, in a function that sends an email, the "to" argument might specify the recipient's email address.
