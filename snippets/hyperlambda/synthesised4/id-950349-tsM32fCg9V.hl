// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [eval] slot in Hyperlambda to execute a lambda object. The [eval] slot contains a child node with [set-value], which changes the value of the [.src] node to "OK". This showcases how [eval] can execute its child nodes, allowing dynamic execution of Hyperlambda code.
