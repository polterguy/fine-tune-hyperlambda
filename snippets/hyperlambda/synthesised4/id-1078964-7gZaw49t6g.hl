/*
 * 1. `@strings.starts-with` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "strings.starts-with" in the current context. It begins its search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a match. This is useful when you want to find a specific node that may not be a direct child or sibling of the current node but exists somewhere in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Checking if a string starts with a specific prefix within a larger Hyperlambda structure.
 * - Validating input data to ensure it begins with a certain substring before processing it further.
