// This Hyperlambda code snippet converts a float array to a byte array. It uses the [floatArray2bytes] slot to transform the float array located at the specified path within the HTTP POST response content. The path is specified by the lambda expression [x:@http.post/*/content/*/data/0/*/embedding/*], which navigates through the HTTP POST response to locate the float array under the "embedding" node. The conversion is necessary for scenarios where binary data representation is required, such as storage or transmission over a network.
floatArray2bytes:x:@http.post/*/content/*/data/0/*/embedding/*
