// 1. `@.data`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "data" within the current context. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node and its siblings. This is useful when you want to access a specific node by name that is not necessarily a direct child of the current node but exists somewhere in the current scope.
