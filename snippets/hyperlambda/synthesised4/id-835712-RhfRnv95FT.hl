// The [validators.enum] slot is used to ensure that the value of the [aggregate_function] node within [.arguments] is one of the predefined legal values: "min", "max", "sum", or "avg". If the value is not one of these, an exception will be thrown, enforcing strict adherence to the allowed set of aggregate functions.
