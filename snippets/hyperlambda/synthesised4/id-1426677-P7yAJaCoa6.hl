/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a given URL does not start with the "http" prefix. It uses the [not] slot to logically invert the result of the [strings.starts-with] slot, which evaluates whether the URL specified in the [.arguments] node starts with "http". If it does not start with "http", the entire expression evaluates to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [not] - Inverts the result of the condition specified in its child node.
 * 2. [strings.starts-with] - Checks if the URL starts with "http".
 * 3. [x:@.arguments/*/url] - Points to the URL node within the [.arguments] node.
 * 4. [.:http] - The string "http" that the URL is checked against.
