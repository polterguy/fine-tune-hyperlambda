// This Hyperlambda code uses the [get-first-value] slot to retrieve the first non-null value from evaluating its children nodes. It attempts to get the value from the node specified by the expression [get-value:x:@http.post/*/content/*/choices/0/*/finish_reason]. If this value is null, it defaults to the static value "unknown". This is useful for providing a fallback value when the primary source might not contain the desired data.
