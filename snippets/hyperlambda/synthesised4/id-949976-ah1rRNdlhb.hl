// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot in Hyperlambda to append nodes to a destination node's children collection. The [add] slot targets the [.dest] node and appends two groups of nodes, each containing two nodes with names and values. The first group consists of [foo1] and [foo2] with values "hello" and "world," respectively, while the second group consists of [bar1] and [bar2] with values "hi" and "planet."
add:x:@.dest

      foo1:hello
      foo2:world
   .
      bar1:hi
      bar2:planet
