 * 1. `.` - Retrieves the parent node of the current node.
 * 2. `*` - Retrieves all children of the parent node.
 * 3. `data.delete` - Filters out all nodes not named [data.delete] from the previous result set.
 * 4. `*` - Retrieves all children of the [data.delete] nodes.
 * 5. `where` - Filters out all nodes not named [where] from the previous result set.
 * 6. `*` - Retrieves all children of the [where] nodes.
 * 7. `and` - Filters out all nodes not named [and] from the previous result set.
 * 
 * This expression navigates from the current node to its parent, then finds all sibling nodes named [data.delete], then drills down through their children to locate [where] nodes, then further down to their children named [and]. The result is all [and] nodes that are descendants of [where] nodes, which are in turn descendants of [data.delete] sibling nodes of the current node.
