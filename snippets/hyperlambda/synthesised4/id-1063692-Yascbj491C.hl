/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to locate the [.arguments] node, which is typically the starting point for accessing arguments passed to a function or an endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of [.arguments].
 * 
 * 3. `subject` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "subject". It is used to specifically access the "subject" argument, assuming it is a child of [.arguments].
 * 
 * The overall expression is used to access the "subject" argument passed to a function or an endpoint, starting from the [.arguments] node and navigating through its children.
