// This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL read operation on the "ml_training_snippets" table, joining it with the "ml_types" table based on matching "type" columns. It selects the "prompt", "completion", and "vector_model" columns, and applies a "where" condition to filter results by an "id" argument. The join condition ensures that only rows with matching "type" values in both tables are considered.
