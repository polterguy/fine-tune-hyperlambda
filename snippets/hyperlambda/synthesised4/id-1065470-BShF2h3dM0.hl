// 1. `@.no`: This iterator looks for the first node named "no" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy. This iterator is useful when you need to reference a specific node by name that exists at the same level or higher in the node structure.
