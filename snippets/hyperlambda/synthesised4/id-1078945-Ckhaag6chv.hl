/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named ".arguments" starting from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the ".arguments" node. It is used to access any arguments that are passed as children of the ".arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `extra` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "extra". It is used to specifically access an argument or parameter named "extra" within the ".arguments" node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to retrieve the value of an argument named "extra" that has been passed to it. This is useful in scenarios where you need to process or validate specific parameters in a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint.
