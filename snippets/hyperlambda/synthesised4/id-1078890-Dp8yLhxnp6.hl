/*
 * 1. `@html2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "html2lambda" in the current context. It is often used to locate a specific node by name within a larger structure.
 *    
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "html2lambda" node. It is useful for accessing all direct descendants of a node without filtering by name.
 * 
 * 3. `html` - This iterator filters the previous result set to include only nodes named "html". It is typically used to narrow down the search to specific elements within a document structure.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "html" node. It allows for accessing all elements nested directly under the "html" node.
 * 
 * 5. `body` - This iterator filters the previous result set to include only nodes named "body". It is commonly used to locate the main content section of an HTML document.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "body" node. It is used to access all elements contained within the "body" section of an HTML document.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting and processing all elements within the body of an HTML document for transformation or analysis.
 * - Navigating through an HTML structure to apply specific operations to all elements within the body section.
