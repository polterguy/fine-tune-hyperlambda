// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.select] slot to execute a SQL query dynamically. It retrieves the SQL query from a node referenced by [.sql], specifies the database type using the [database-type] slot with a value from [.arguments/*/databaseType], and assigns the result to the node referenced by [.dp/#]. The [data.select] slot is used for executing SQL queries and returning the results as a lambda object.
data.select:x:@.sql
   database-type:x:@.arguments/*/databaseType
