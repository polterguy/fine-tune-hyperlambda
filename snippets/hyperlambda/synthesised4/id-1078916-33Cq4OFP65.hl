/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] from the current context. This is typically used in Hyperlambda to access the arguments passed to a function or an HTTP endpoint. The `@` symbol indicates that it looks for the node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any child node under [.arguments], regardless of their names. This is useful when you want to operate on or examine all argument nodes passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `start` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named [start] among the children of [.arguments]. It is used to specifically access the [start] argument, which might represent a starting value, position, or index in a given context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a specific argument named [start] in a function or HTTP endpoint to determine the starting point for a process, such as pagination or iteration.
 * - Retrieving a configuration or parameter value that dictates the beginning of a sequence or operation.
