// This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.replace] slot to remove the substring " without time zone" from the value of the [strings.replace] node. The result is that any occurrence of " without time zone" in the original string is replaced with an empty string, effectively deleting it. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the substring to look for, and the second is the replacement string. In this case, the replacement string is empty.
