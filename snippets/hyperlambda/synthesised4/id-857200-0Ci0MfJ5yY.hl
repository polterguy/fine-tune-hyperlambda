// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates a left join operation between two tables, "contacts" and "clients", using the "client_id" column as the joining key. The [join] slot specifies the table to join with, while the [as] slot provides an alias for the "clients" table. The [type] slot indicates the type of join, which is a left join in this case. The [on] slot defines the join condition, using an [and] slot to ensure that the "client_id" from the "contacts" table matches the "client_id" from the "clients" table.
