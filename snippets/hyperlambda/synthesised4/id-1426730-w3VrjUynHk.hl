The message indicates that the "Crawl-Delay" was not a valid integer and defaults to using 10 seconds. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to broadcast this message to subscribers of the feedback channel, with the [args] node containing the message details. The [message] node specifies the content of the warning, while the [type] node categorizes the message as a warning.
