// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to query a database table named "line_items". It uses a [where] clause with an [and] condition to filter the results based on multiple criteria. The [where] clause allows for complex filtering by combining multiple conditions, ensuring only records meeting all specified criteria are returned. This setup is useful for retrieving specific data subsets from a database table.
