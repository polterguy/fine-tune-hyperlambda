/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves to the next node below the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the node immediately following the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. After moving to the elder sibling with the `+` iterator, the `*` iterator will gather all children nodes of that sibling. This is useful for operations that need to process or evaluate all child nodes of a specific node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to navigate to the next node in a sequence and then perform operations on all its children, such as iterating over them or applying transformations.
