// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to convert and set the value of a node. It uses [set-value] to update the value of the node referenced by [.dp], after converting it with [convert] to a specified type. The type is dynamically determined using a lambda expression that retrieves the type from a specific path in the node structure. The process involves the following steps: 1. [set-value] updates the node's value. 2. [convert] changes the node's value type. 3. [type] specifies the target type for conversion.
