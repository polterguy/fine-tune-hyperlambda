/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which is often used to pass parameters to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any nodes that are direct children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `autocrawl` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `autocrawl`. It is used to specifically target the `autocrawl` node among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to access a specific argument named `autocrawl` that is passed to it. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to perform operations based on the value of the `autocrawl` argument, such as initiating an automated crawling process if the argument is set to a specific value.
