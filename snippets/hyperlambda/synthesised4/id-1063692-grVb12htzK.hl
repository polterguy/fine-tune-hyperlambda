// 1. `@.public-key`: This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which indicates that it will return the first node with the name "public-key" in the current context. The `.` before "public-key" specifies that it should look for this node starting from the current node's context, not traversing siblings, but only direct children and itself. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name within the current node's hierarchy, such as retrieving a public key stored in a node named "public-key".
