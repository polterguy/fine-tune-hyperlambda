// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the invocation of a dynamic slot named "magic.ai.vectorise" using the [signal] slot. It passes two arguments, [type] and [feedback-channel], which are retrieved from the current context using lambda expressions. The [type] argument is obtained from the [.type] node, and the [feedback-channel] argument is obtained from the [.feedback-channel] node. This setup is typically used to trigger AI vectorization processes with specific configurations.
signal:magic.ai.vectorise
   type:x:@.type
   feedback-channel:x:@.feedback-channel
