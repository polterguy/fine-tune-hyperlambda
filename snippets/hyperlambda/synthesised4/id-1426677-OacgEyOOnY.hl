// This Hyperlambda code sends a signal to a specified feedback channel using the [sockets.signal] slot. It constructs a message by concatenating strings and sends it as an argument under the [args] node. The message type is specified as "info". The [sockets.signal] slot is used to publish messages to connected clients, allowing real-time communication. The [args] node contains the message details, which are transmitted to subscribers of the feedback channel. The [strings.concat] slot is used to build the message content dynamically.
