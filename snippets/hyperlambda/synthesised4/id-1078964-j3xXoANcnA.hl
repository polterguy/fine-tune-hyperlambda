/*
 * 1. `@xml2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named `xml2lambda` in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further traversal within the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `xml2lambda` node. It is used to navigate through all the direct descendants of the `xml2lambda` node.
 * 
 * 3. `urlset` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to find those specifically named `urlset`. It is used to narrow down the search to nodes that are part of the `urlset` structure.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `urlset` node. It is used to navigate through all the direct descendants of the `urlset` node.
 * 
 * 5. `url` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to find those specifically named `url`. It is used to narrow down the search to nodes that are part of the `url` structure.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `url` node. It is used to navigate through all the direct descendants of the `url` node.
 * 
 * 7. `loc` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to find those specifically named `loc`. It is used to narrow down the search to nodes that are part of the `loc` structure.
 * 
 * 8. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `loc` node. It is used to navigate through all the direct descendants of the `loc` node.
 * 
 * 9. `#text` - This iterator retrieves the value of the node, assuming that the value is a node itself. It is used to access the textual content of the `loc` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract all the text content from `loc` nodes within a structured XML-like document that has been converted to a Hyperlambda node structure. It is particularly useful for processing XML sitemaps where URLs are stored within `loc` nodes.
