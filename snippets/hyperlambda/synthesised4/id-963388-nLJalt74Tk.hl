// The code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [yield] slot to return a message and a new user ID. The [yield] slot outputs a message indicating that a user was created without returning an ID, and it also returns the new user ID obtained from the [mssql.create] slot. This approach is useful for providing feedback and returning data after executing a database operation.
yield
   message:User created without returning ID
   new_user_id:x:@mssql.create
