/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to declare a node with a specific type and value. The node [.foo] is declared with an integer type and assigned the value 57. The [type] slot is then used to retrieve the type name of the node directly above it, which is [.foo]. The expected result of executing the [type] slot is the string "int", indicating the type of the node. 
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with the name ".foo", type "int", and value "57".
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type name of the node directly above it, which is ".foo".
