// This Hyperlambda code uses an [if] statement to check if the value of [var1] within [.arguments] is true. If the condition is met, it logs the message "First condition is true" using [log.info]. The [eq] slot checks for equality between [var1] and the boolean true, and the [.lambda] block is executed only if this condition is satisfied.
