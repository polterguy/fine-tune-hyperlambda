/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to read data from a SQLite database, specifically from a table named "Patients". The [data.read] slot is used to specify the database type as SQLite and to define the table and columns to be selected. The columns listed include various patient details such as PatientID, FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth, Gender, and contact information, among others. The [where] clause is included but not detailed, suggesting that it could be expanded to filter the results based on specific conditions. 
 * 
 * The [yield] slot at the end of the code is used to return the results of the [data.read] operation. It captures all the records retrieved from the "Patients" table and assigns them to a node named "patients". The expression `x:@data.read/*` within the [yield] slot indicates that all child nodes of the [data.read] operation are to be included in the result set. This setup is useful for extracting detailed patient information from the database and making it available for further processing or display.
