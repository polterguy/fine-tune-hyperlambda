// This Hyperlambda code logs a message indicating that the "Users" table was accessed with a CRUD read operation. It retrieves the email addresses from the result of a database read operation and includes them in the log entry. The [log.info] slot logs the information, and the [email] slot uses an expression to extract email addresses from the database read result.
log.info:Users table was accessed with a CRUD read operation
