/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator looks for the first node with the specified name in its hierarchy. In this case, it searches for the first node named "result" starting from the current node and traversing upwards through its ancestors and siblings.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the value of a node named "result" that is expected to be an output or outcome of a previous operation.
 * - Accessing a result node that is commonly used to store the outcome of a computation or process within a larger Hyperlambda script.
