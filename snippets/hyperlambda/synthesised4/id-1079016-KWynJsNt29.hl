/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator looks for the first node with the specified name within the current context. In this case, it searches for the first node named "tmp" starting from the current node's context. It does not traverse sibling nodes but rather looks for a direct child or descendant node with the specified name.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is useful when you need to access a specific node named "tmp" within the current context, possibly to retrieve its value or manipulate its children nodes. It is often used in scenarios where the node structure is known, and you want to directly access a particular node by its name.
