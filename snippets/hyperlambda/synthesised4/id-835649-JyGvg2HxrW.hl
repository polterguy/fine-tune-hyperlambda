// The code changes the name of a node to a concatenated string. It uses [set-name] to modify the name of nodes referenced by its expression. The new name is created by concatenating a static string "p" with the value of another node using [strings.concat]. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the node specified in its expression to be used in the concatenation.
