/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sends a signal to a feedback channel using the [sockets.signal] slot. It transmits a message with the content "Remember to vectorize before attempting to use your model" and specifies the message type as "info". This is typically used to notify users or systems about important information or reminders related to a process or operation. The [else] slot indicates that this action is performed when a preceding condition is not met. 
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Indicates the start of an alternative action when a preceding condition is not met.
 * 2. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to the specified feedback channel.
 * 3. [args] - Contains the arguments to be transmitted with the signal.
 * 4. [message] - Specifies the content of the message to be sent.
 * 5. [type] - Indicates the type of message being sent, in this case, "info".
