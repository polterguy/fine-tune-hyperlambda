 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve nodes from a specified path.
 * // The [get-nodes] slot returns the nodes that its expression is referencing, allowing you to access specific parts of the node structure.
 * // In this example, the expression points to the first node within the [sort] node, effectively retrieving it.
 * // 1. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes based on the expression provided, which in this case is the first node within [sort].
