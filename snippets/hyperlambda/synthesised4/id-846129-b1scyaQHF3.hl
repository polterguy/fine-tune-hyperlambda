// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [yield] slot to return a structured result. It includes a [json] slot that retrieves a JSON object, a [workflow] slot that executes a string joining operation, and a [result] node to encapsulate the output. The [yield] slot is crucial for returning values from dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints.
