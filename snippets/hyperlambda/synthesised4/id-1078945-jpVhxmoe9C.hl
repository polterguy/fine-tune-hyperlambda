/*
 * 1. `@.cont`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "cont" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first matching node it encounters. This is useful when you want to access a specific node that might be a parent or an ancestor of the current node, and you know its name. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: If you have a hierarchical structure and you need to retrieve a configuration or context node that is always named "cont" and is located somewhere above the current node in the hierarchy, this expression will help you find it efficiently.
