/*
 * This Hyperlambda code connects to a database named "shopDB" and initiates a transaction. Within the transaction, it attempts to delete records from the "temp_data" table where the "created_at" date is before January 1, 2020. However, the transaction is explicitly rolled back, ensuring no records are actually deleted. The rollback is used to prevent any changes from being committed to the database. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.connect] - Connects to the "shopDB" database.
 * 2. [data.transaction.create] - Starts a new database transaction.
 * 3. [data.delete] - Deletes records from the specified table.
 * 4. [table] - Specifies the table "temp_data" to delete records from.
 * 5. [where] - Defines the condition for deleting records.
 * 6. [and] - Logical AND for combining conditions.
 * 7. [created_at.lt] - Condition to match records with a "created_at" date less than the specified date.
 * 8. [data.transaction.rollback] - Rolls back the transaction, preventing any changes.
