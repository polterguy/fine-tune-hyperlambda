// This Hyperlambda code uses the [execute] slot to invoke a workflow action named "markdown2html". It specifies the filename of the action and provides an [arguments] node with a [markdown] argument. The [markdown] argument is dynamically set by retrieving the content from a node path using a lambda expression that includes [html-encode-body] and [content]. This setup allows for converting Markdown content to HTML within a workflow.

   name:markdown2html
