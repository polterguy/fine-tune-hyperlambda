/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets a default value for a node. It uses the [set-value] slot to assign the boolean value "false" to the node referenced by the expression [@.relevant]. If the node does not exist, it will be created with the specified value.
 * 
 * 1. [default] - This slot is used to ensure a default value is set for a node.
 * 2. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node specified by the expression in its value.
 * 3. [@.relevant] - Expression pointing to the node that will have its value set.
 * 4. [.:bool:false] - The value to be set for the node, which is a boolean "false".
