// This Hyperlambda code snippet pauses the execution of the current thread for 100 milliseconds. The [sleep] slot is used to temporarily halt the thread, releasing it back to the operating system, which makes it a non-blocking call. This allows the system to manage resources efficiently while the thread is inactive.
