// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] and [strings.replace] slots to modify the value of a node. The [set-value] slot changes the value of the [.result] node by replacing occurrences of a specific substring within its current value. The [strings.replace] slot is used to find and replace the substring [[greeting]] with the value retrieved from the [.greeting] node using [get-value]. This operation effectively updates the [.result] node to include the desired greeting text.
set-value:x:@.result
   strings.replace:x:@.result
      .:[[greeting]]
      get-value:x:@.greeting
