// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes from a specified source to a target node. It retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node using [get-nodes] and appends them to the [where] node within a [data.read] structure. This operation effectively merges argument nodes into the query criteria, allowing for dynamic query construction based on provided arguments.
