 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a database table named "participants" using the [data.read] slot. The [data.read] slot is used to create a SQL SELECT statement to retrieve records from a specified table. In this example, no additional parameters such as columns, conditions, or limits are provided, so it will default to selecting all columns and limiting the result set to 25 records by default unless overridden.
 * // 1. [data.read] - Initiates a read operation from a database.
 * // 2. [table] - Specifies the table name "participants" from which to read data.
