// This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if the [session] node exists within the [.arguments] node, is not null, and is not equal to an empty value. It uses the [and] slot to ensure all these conditions are true simultaneously. If any condition is false, the entire [and] block evaluates to false. The [exists] slot checks for the presence of the [session] node, [not-null] ensures it has a non-null value, and [neq] verifies that its value is not an empty string.
