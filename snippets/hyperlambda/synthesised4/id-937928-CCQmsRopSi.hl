// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [if] slot to check if a condition is true. The condition is evaluated using the expression "x:-", which points to the previous node. If the condition is true, it executes the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [result] node to "Yup!". The [if] slot directly uses an expression, allowing the [set-value] operation to be executed without needing a [.lambda] node.
if:x:-
   set-value:x:@.result
      .:Yup!
