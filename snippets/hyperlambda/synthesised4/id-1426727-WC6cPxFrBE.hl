// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [sleep] slot to pause the execution of the current thread for a specified duration. The duration is determined by the value of the [delay] node within the [.arguments] node. The [sleep] slot releases the thread back to the operating system, making it a non-blocking call that requires zero physical operating system threads while it is sleeping. This is useful for creating delays in execution without consuming system resources.
