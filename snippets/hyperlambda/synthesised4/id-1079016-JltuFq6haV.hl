/*
 * 1. `@.fixed`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "fixed" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches for the node in the current scope and its ancestors, but it does not traverse siblings. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is guaranteed to be in the hierarchy above the current node, such as a configuration or a constant value that is defined earlier in the Hyperlambda script. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a configuration node that is defined at the beginning of a script.
 * - Retrieving a constant value that is used throughout the script for consistency.
