// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named "cascading" exists within the [.arguments] node, is not null, and has a boolean value of true. It uses the [and] slot to ensure all conditions are met, combining [exists], [not-null], and [eq] slots to perform these checks. If all conditions are true, the [and] slot evaluates to true.
