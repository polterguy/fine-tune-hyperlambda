/*
 * 1. `@.base`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "base" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches through the current node's ancestors and siblings to find the node named "base". This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is expected to be defined earlier in the structure, such as a configuration or a shared resource node that multiple parts of your Hyperlambda code might need to reference. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a configuration node that defines settings or parameters used by various parts of the Hyperlambda script.
 * - Retrieving a shared resource or context node that holds data or state information needed by multiple operations within the script.
