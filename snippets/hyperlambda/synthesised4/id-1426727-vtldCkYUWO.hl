// // This code snippet pauses the execution of the current thread for 100 milliseconds. The [sleep] slot is used to temporarily halt the execution, allowing the system to perform other tasks or simply wait. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a delay is necessary, such as waiting for a resource to become available or simulating a pause in processing. The sleep operation is non-blocking, meaning it does not consume CPU resources while waiting, as the thread is released back to the operating system during the sleep period.
