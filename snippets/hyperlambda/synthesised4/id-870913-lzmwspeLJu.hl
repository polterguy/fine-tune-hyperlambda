/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to insert a new record into the "ml_training_snippets" table using the [data.create] slot. It takes values for the columns "type," "prompt," "completion," and "uri," where "type" is dynamically retrieved from the arguments, and the rest are static strings. This approach helps in preventing SQL injection by using parameterized queries.
 * 
 * 1. [data.create] - Initiates the creation of a new record in the specified table.
 * 2. [table] - Specifies the table name "ml_training_snippets" where the record will be inserted.
 * 3. [values] - Contains the fields and their respective values to be inserted into the table.
 * 4. [type] - Dynamically retrieves the value from the arguments using a lambda expression.
 * 5. [prompt] - Sets a static string value for the "prompt" field.
 * 6. [completion] - Sets a static string value for the "completion" field.
 * 7. [uri] - Sets a static string value for the "uri" field.
