/*
 * 1. `@signal`: This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context with the name "signal". It is used to access a specific node directly by its name, without traversing siblings or children. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to check or manipulate the value of a node named "signal" in a Hyperlambda graph, such as monitoring or responding to a specific event or status represented by this node.
