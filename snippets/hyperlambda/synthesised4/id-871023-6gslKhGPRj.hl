// The code snippet dynamically adds nodes into a destination node collection. It uses the [add] slot to append nodes from a source to a destination. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node's headers, and these nodes are added to the headers node in the current context. This allows for the dynamic inclusion of additional header nodes into an existing headers collection.
