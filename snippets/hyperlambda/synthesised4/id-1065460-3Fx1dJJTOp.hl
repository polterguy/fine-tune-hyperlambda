/*
 * 1. `@.columns`: This iterator searches for the first node named "columns" starting from the current node. It traverses upwards in the hierarchy if necessary, but does not search among siblings. This is useful when you need to find a specific node in a nested structure without knowing its exact position relative to the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node(s) found by the previous iterator. In this context, it will return all direct children of the "columns" node. This is useful for iterating over all elements within a specific parent node, such as processing each column in a data structure.
