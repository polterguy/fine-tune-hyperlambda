// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [context] slot to store a value in the execution context and retrieve it using [get-context]. The [context] slot is used to add an object to the stack with a specified name and value, along with a [.lambda] block where the context object can be accessed. The [get-context] slot is then used within the [.lambda] block to retrieve the stored value. This mechanism is useful for maintaining data accessibility throughout the execution of a Hyperlambda snippet without passing it as an argument.
