// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert a node into a specific location in a Hyperlambda graph. It targets a node structure using a lambda expression, specifically focusing on the [tables] node and its first child, then moves to its previous sibling. The [add] slot is used to insert a new node named [foreign_keys] at this location. This operation is useful for dynamically modifying a graph structure by adding new elements based on the current state of the graph.
