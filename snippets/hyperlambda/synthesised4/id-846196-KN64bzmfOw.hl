// This code checks if the [data] node exists, is not null, and is not equal to an empty string. If all conditions are true, it sets the value of [extra-tokens] by tokenizing the [data] node using the [openai.tokenize] slot. The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, and [and] ensures all conditions must be true for the [set-value] operation to occur.
