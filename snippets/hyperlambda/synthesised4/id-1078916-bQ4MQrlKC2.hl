/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to access the [.arguments] node, which is typically where input parameters or arguments for a function or endpoint are stored.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument or parameter passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `extra`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find the first node with the name "extra". It is used to specifically access the "extra" argument or parameter if it exists.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to access and manipulate the value of an "extra" argument passed to it. For example, if an endpoint accepts additional optional parameters, this expression can be used to check if the "extra" parameter was provided and perform actions based on its value.
