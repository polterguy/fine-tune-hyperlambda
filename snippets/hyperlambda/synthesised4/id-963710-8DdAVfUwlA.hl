// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform an HTTP POST request to a specified URL using the [http.post] slot. It constructs the request payload as a semantic lambda object, where the [id] node is set to an integer value of 1, and the [userId] node's value is dynamically retrieved from another node using a lambda expression. This setup allows for automatic transformation of the payload into a JSON object before sending it to the endpoint.
