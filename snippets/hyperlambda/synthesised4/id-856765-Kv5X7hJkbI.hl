/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert a new node into a specified location within a graph. The [add] slot is used here to add a [model_size] node with an integer value of 128000 as a child to the [model] node. The [add] slot takes an expression pointing to the target node where the new node should be added, and the new node is specified as a child of the [.] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [case] - The root node, possibly indicating a test or scenario.
 * 2. [add] - Slot used to add a new node to the specified location in the graph.
 * 3. [x:@.model] - Expression pointing to the [model] node where the new node will be added.
 * 4. [.] - Parent node for the new node being added.
 * 5. [model_size:int:128000] - New node being added, with a name of [model_size], type [int], and value [128000].
