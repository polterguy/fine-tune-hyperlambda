/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-x] slot to modify the type of nodes referenced by an expression. It first targets nodes using the [remove-nodes] expression, then uses [convert] to change the type of these nodes to the result of a string concatenation operation. The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine strings, and its result is converted to a specified type using the [convert] slot. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-x] - Modifies the type of nodes referenced by an expression.
 * 2. [convert] - Converts the result of a string concatenation to a specified type.
 * 3. [strings.concat] - Concatenates strings to form a single result.
