/*
 * 1. `@.settings` - This iterator searches for the first node named "settings" in the current context. It is used to locate the node that contains configuration or settings data.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "settings" node. It is used to access the entire collection of settings or configuration entries.
 * 
 * 3. `"{@.arguments/*/key}"` - This is an extrapolated expression that dynamically evaluates to a value. It retrieves the value of the "key" node within the "arguments" node, and uses this value as a string to match against the names of the children nodes of "settings". This allows for dynamic access to a specific setting based on the key provided in the arguments.
