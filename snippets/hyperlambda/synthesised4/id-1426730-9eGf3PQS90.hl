 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to insert a node named "disallow" as a child of the node(s) referenced by the expression "x:@try/*/return". The expression navigates to the "return" node(s) that are children of the "try" node. The [add] slot is used to modify the structure of the Hyperlambda graph by adding new nodes at specified locations.
 * // 1. [add] - Inserts a new node at the specified location in the Hyperlambda graph.
 * // 2. [.] - Represents the node to be added, in this case, a node named "disallow" without a value.
