// This Hyperlambda code uses the [lambda2csv] slot to convert a lambda object, retrieved from the [data.read] slot, into a CSV string. The [lambda2csv] slot processes the lambda object, extracting its structure and values, and returns a CSV formatted string, preserving type information and node names for accurate conversion back to lambda if needed.
