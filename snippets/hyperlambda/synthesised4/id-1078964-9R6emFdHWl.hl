 * 1. `@` - This iterator is used to find the first node with the specified name that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. In this case, it looks for the first node named "match" that appears before the current context in the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in scenarios where you need to retrieve or manipulate the first occurrence of a node named "match" that appears earlier in the hierarchy. For instance, it could be used to check a condition or retrieve a value associated with a "match" node that is defined prior to the current node in a sequence of operations.
