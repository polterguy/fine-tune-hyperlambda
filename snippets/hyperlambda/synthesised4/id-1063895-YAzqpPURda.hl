// 1. `@.tail`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "tail" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings but only looks at direct ancestors. This is useful when you need to find a specific node in the hierarchy that is not a sibling but an ancestor, such as when you need to access configuration or context information defined higher up in the structure.
