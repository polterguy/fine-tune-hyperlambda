// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [get-value] slot to retrieve the value of a node. It first defines a node [.data] with the value "Hello World", and then uses [get-value] with the expression "x:-" to get the value of the node immediately above it, which is [.data]. The result is the value "Hello World".
