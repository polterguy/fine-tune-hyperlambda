 * 2. `**` - Retrieves all descendant nodes (including itself) of the [.session] node using a breadth-first search.
 * 3. `role` - Filters the result to only nodes named [role] among all descendants of [.session].
 * 4. `=developer` - Further filters to only those [role] nodes whose value is exactly "developer".
 * 5. `[0,1]` - Selects the first node from the filtered set (if any).
 * 6. `.` - Retrieves the parent node of the selected [role] node.
 * 7. `*` - Retrieves all children of that parent node.
 * 8. `content` - Filters to only nodes named [content] among those children.
 * 
 * This expression finds the first [role] node with value "developer" under [.session], then retrieves the [content] child node(s) of its parent.
