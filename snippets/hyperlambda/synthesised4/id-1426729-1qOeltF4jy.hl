/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [switch] slot to perform conditional branching based on the value of a node. The [switch] slot evaluates the value of the [.val] node and executes the first matching [case] node. If no [case] matches, the [default] node is executed. The code sets the [.result] node's value based on the matching case. Below is a breakdown of the slots used:
 * // 1. [.val] - Declares a node with a value to be evaluated by the [switch].
 * // 2. [.result] - Declares a node where the result of the switch operation will be stored.
 * // 3. [switch] - Evaluates the value of [.val] and executes the matching [case] node.
 * // 4. [case:bar] - A case that matches if the value of [.val] is "bar" and sets the [.result] to "Oops".
 * // 5. [case:foo] - A case that matches if the value of [.val] is "foo" and sets the [.result] to "Success!".
 * // 6. [case:ol] - A case that matches if the value of [.val] is "ol" and executes its children nodes.
