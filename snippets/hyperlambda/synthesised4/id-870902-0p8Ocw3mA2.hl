// This Hyperlambda code uses the [data.read] slot to query a database table named "ml_training_snippets". It selects the "id" column, renaming it as "rowid", and applies a [where] clause with an [and] condition containing an [or] condition. The [limit] is set to -1, indicating no limit on the number of records returned.
