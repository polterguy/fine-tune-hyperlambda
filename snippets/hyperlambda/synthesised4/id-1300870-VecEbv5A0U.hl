// This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to read data from a database table named "Order". It specifies that only the "OrderId" and "OrderDate" columns should be retrieved. The selection of records is filtered using a "where" clause that checks if the "CustomerId" field is equal to a value retrieved from a node structure, specifically from the "CustomerId" node within a data segment. The use of `x:@.dp/#/*/CustomerId` in the expression allows for dynamic referencing of the "CustomerId" value, which is useful for scenarios where the customer ID is provided or modified at runtime. Finally, the results of this data read operation are yielded as "orders", which can be used for further processing or returned to the caller. This approach is particularly useful in applications where you need to dynamically filter orders based on customer information provided at runtime.
