/*
 * 1. `@.uri`: This iterator searches for the first node named "uri" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "uri" node it encounters in the current context.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to retrieve a URI value from a configuration or context node in a Hyperlambda script, allowing you to dynamically access resources or endpoints based on the current execution context.
