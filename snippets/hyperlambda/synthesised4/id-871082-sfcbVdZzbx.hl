// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.filter] node by concatenating a "%" character before and after the value obtained from the [query] node within [.arguments]. The [set-value] slot assigns this concatenated string to [.filter], while [strings.concat] constructs the string by combining "%" with the [query] value and another "%". The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [query] node to be used in the concatenation.
