// This Hyperlambda code uses the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve all nodes that match the expression provided. The expression [@.arguments/*/limit] navigates the node structure to find the [limit] node within the children of the [.arguments] node. The [get-nodes] slot will return these nodes, allowing further operations to be performed on them.
