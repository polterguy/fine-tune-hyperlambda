// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] statement to define specific conditions that, when met, execute the associated lambda object. Each [case] node must have a value, which can be a constant or an expression, and the [switch] will evaluate its value against these [case] values to determine which block to execute. This allows for conditional branching based on multiple potential values, similar to a switch/case structure in traditional programming languages.
