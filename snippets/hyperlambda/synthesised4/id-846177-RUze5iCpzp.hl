// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot in Hyperlambda to dynamically append nodes to a specified destination node. The [add] slot takes an expression pointing to the destination node, and its children nodes are added to the destination's children collection. In this example, a node named [automatic] with a boolean value of true is added to the children of the node referenced by the expression [@.tmp/*].
add:x:@.tmp/*
   .
      automatic:bool:true
