// The code demonstrates a conditional execution using the [if] slot. It checks if the value of the [.toggle] node is equal to boolean true using the [eq] slot. If the condition is true, it executes the [.lambda] block, which logs an informational message indicating that [.toggle] is on. The [.lambda] block is only executed if the condition evaluates to true.
