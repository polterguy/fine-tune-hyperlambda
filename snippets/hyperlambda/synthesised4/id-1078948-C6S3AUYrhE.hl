/*
 * 1. `@.model`: This iterator searches for the first node named "model" at the current level of the hierarchy or any ancestor level. It starts from the current node and moves upwards until it finds a node named "model". This is useful when you need to access a specific node in a complex structure without knowing its exact position.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the "model" node. It is used to access any node directly under "model", regardless of their names. This is helpful when you want to perform operations on all direct children of a specific node.
 * 
 * 3. `threshold`: This iterator filters the result from the previous step to include only nodes named "threshold". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes with a specific name, which is useful when you are interested in a particular type of data or configuration under a parent node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving configuration settings or parameters named "threshold" from a "model" node in a machine learning or data processing application.
 * - Accessing threshold values for different models in a system where each model has its own set of parameters.
