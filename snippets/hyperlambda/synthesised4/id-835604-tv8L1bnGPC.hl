/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a left join between the "EmployeeTerritories" and "Employees" tables in a SQLite database. It specifies the columns to be selected, including an alias for the "LastName" column from the "Employees" table. The join condition is defined by matching the "EmployeeID" fields from both tables. The [where] clause is prepared for additional filtering conditions. 
 * 
 * 1. [database-type] - Specifies the type of database being used, in this case, SQLite.
 * 2. [table] - Indicates the primary table for the query, "EmployeeTerritories".
 * 3. [join] - Defines a left join with the "Employees" table, using "EmployeeID" as an alias.
 * 4. [type] - Specifies the type of join, which is a left join.
 * 5. [on] - Sets the condition for the join, matching "EmployeeID" fields from both tables.
 * 6. [columns] - Lists the columns to be selected, including an alias for "LastName".
 * 7. [where] - Prepares the query for additional filtering conditions.
