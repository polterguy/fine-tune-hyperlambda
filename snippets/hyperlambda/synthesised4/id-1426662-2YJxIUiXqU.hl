// The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expression provided in its value before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this case, it evaluates the expression [x:+/*] and assigns the result to the node where [unwrap] is used. This allows for forward evaluation of expressions, which is useful when invoking lambda objects with expressions, ensuring that the expressions are evaluated before the lambda object is executed.
unwrap:x:+/*
