/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet replaces all occurrences of double spaces with a single space in the value of the [.completion] node. It uses the [strings.replace] slot to perform the replacement operation. The [set-value] slot is then used to update the value of the [.completion] node with the modified string. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the specified node.
 * 2. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a specified string within another string.
 * 3. [.] - Represents a static string value used in the replacement operation.
