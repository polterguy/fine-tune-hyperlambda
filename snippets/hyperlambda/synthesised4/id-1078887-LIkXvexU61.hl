/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda) of the current node. It is used to navigate to the next sibling node in the hierarchy. This can be useful when you want to perform operations or checks on the node immediately following the current one.
 * 
 * 2. `/**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the current node, including the node itself, using a "breadth first" algorithm. It is used to access all nodes that are hierarchically below the current node, regardless of their depth. This can be useful for operations that need to consider all nested nodes, such as aggregating data or applying transformations to an entire subtree.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - You might use this expression to navigate to the next sibling node and then gather all its descendant nodes for processing, such as collecting data from a specific section of a configuration file or applying a batch operation to a group of related nodes.
