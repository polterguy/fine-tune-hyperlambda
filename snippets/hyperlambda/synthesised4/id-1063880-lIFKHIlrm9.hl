/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current node's context. It starts the search from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 *    
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It allows you to access any node that is directly under the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `headers` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "headers" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It effectively narrows down the search to find a specific node named "headers" among the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to access HTTP headers passed as arguments to a Hyperlambda endpoint. By using this expression, you can directly retrieve the "headers" node from the arguments, which might contain HTTP request headers or other metadata necessary for processing the request.
