/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a block of code when previous conditional checks have failed. Within the [else] block, it uses [set-value] to modify the value of the [.result] node by replacing occurrences of the string "[[copy_button]]" with "false" using the [strings.replace] slot.
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes the following block if previous conditions are false.
 * 2. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.result] node.
 * 3. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of "[[copy_button]]" with "false" in the [.result] node.
