/*
 * 1. `@.no`: This iterator searches for the first node named `.no` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, and the `.` prefix means it will start searching from the current node's parent. This is useful when you want to access a specific sibling node or a node in the same level of hierarchy as the current node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve a configuration or setting node named `.no` that is located at the same level as the current node, allowing for dynamic adjustments or checks based on its value.
