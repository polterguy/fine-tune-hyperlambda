/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the [html2markdown] node is either null or has an empty value. It uses the [or] slot to evaluate two conditions: the first condition checks if [html2markdown] is null using the [null] slot, and the second condition checks if [html2markdown] is equal to an empty value using the [eq] slot. If either of these conditions is true, the overall expression evaluates to true.
 * 
 * 1. [or] - Evaluates multiple conditions and returns true if at least one condition is true.
 * 2. [null:x:@html2markdown] - Checks if the [html2markdown] node is null or has no nodes.
 * 3. [eq:x:@html2markdown] - Compares the value of [html2markdown] to an empty value.
 * 4. [.:] - Represents an empty value for comparison in the [eq] slot.
