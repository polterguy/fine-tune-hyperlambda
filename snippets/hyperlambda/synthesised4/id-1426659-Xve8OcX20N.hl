// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the first node referenced by the expression `@.dp/#/./*/\@href/[0,1]` starts with the character "/". The [strings.starts-with] slot is used to perform this check, where the expression points to a node, and the comparison is made with the static value "/".
