// The code snippet uses the [lambda2hyper] slot to convert a lambda object, specifically the result of an [http.post] invocation, into a Hyperlambda string. This allows for the serialization and transfer of the HTTP POST response, including headers and content, into a format that can be persisted or sent to another server. The [lambda2hyper] slot takes the lambda object as input and outputs its Hyperlambda representation.
lambda2hyper:x:@http.post
