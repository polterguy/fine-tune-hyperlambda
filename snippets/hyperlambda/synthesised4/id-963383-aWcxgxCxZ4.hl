// The code snippet uses the [yield] slot to return a message indicating that inactive accounts have been removed, along with the number of affected records from a [mysql.delete] operation. The [yield] slot is used in dynamic slots to return values or node lists, and in this case, it returns a [message] node with a static string and an [affected-records] node with the result of the [mysql.delete] operation.
yield
   message:Inactive accounts removed
