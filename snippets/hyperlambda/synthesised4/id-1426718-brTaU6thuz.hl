// The [type] slot in Hyperlambda returns the type name of a specified value. In the provided example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer type and a value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to retrieve the type of the value in the [.foo] node. After invoking the [type] slot, it will return the type of the specified node, which in this case is "int". This functionality is useful for dynamically determining and verifying the types of values within a Hyperlambda script.
