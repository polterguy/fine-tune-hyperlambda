// This code iterates over each node in the [substitutes] collection and performs a string replacement on the [body] node. For each iteration, it replaces occurrences of the current node's name enclosed in curly braces with the node's value. The [for-each] slot iterates through nodes, [set-value] updates the [body] node, and [strings.replace] performs the string substitution using [strings.concat] to format the placeholder.
