// The [and] slot in Hyperlambda is used for logical conjunction, requiring all its child conditions to evaluate to true for the [and] slot itself to return true. It short-circuits, meaning it stops evaluating further conditions once a false condition is encountered, optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary evaluations. This slot is useful in constructing complex logical expressions where multiple conditions must be simultaneously satisfied.
