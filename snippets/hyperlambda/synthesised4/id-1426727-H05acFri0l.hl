// The [type] slot in Hyperlambda is used to return the type name of a given value. In the provided example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer value of 57. The [type] slot is then used with an expression pointing to the node directly above it (using the "-" iterator), which results in the [type] slot returning "int" as the type name of the value in [.foo]. This allows developers to dynamically retrieve and work with the type information of nodes within their Hyperlambda code.
