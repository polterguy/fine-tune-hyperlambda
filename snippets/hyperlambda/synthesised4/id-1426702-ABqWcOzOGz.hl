/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code concatenates a base URL with a model ID to form a complete API endpoint URL for OpenAI's fine-tuning service. The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine a static string representing the base URL with the value of the [.model-id] node, which is retrieved using the [get-value] slot. The resulting URL is intended for accessing or managing fine-tuning jobs in OpenAI's API.
 * // 1. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into a single string.
 * // 2. [.] - Represents a static string value, in this case, the base URL for OpenAI's fine-tuning API.
 * // 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [.model-id] node to be concatenated with the base URL.
