// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specified string within another string. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the string to be replaced, and the second is the replacement string. In this example, the string to be replaced is retrieved from the [extra] node, and the replacement string is obtained using [get-value] from the [extra] argument within [.arguments]. The result of this operation is stored in the [.result] node.
strings.replace:x:@.result
   .:[[extra]]
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/extra
