/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator searches for the first node named "result" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its hierarchy. It will return the first "result" node it encounters. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve the value of a "result" node that is expected to be present in the current context or any of its ancestors, which is useful in scenarios where the result of a computation or operation needs to be accessed or checked.
