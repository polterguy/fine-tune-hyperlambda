/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement to perform conditional branching based on the value of a [gpt-3.5-turbo-16k] node. The [switch] statement evaluates the value of the [gpt-3.5-turbo-16k] node and executes the corresponding [case] block if a match is found. Each [case] block can contain any number of slots and logic to be executed when the case condition is met. This pattern is useful for handling multiple potential values of a node and executing different logic based on the specific value encountered.
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Represents a conditional branch within a [switch] statement that executes if the specified value matches the value being evaluated.
 * 2. [gpt-3.5-turbo-16k] - The node whose value is being evaluated in the [switch] statement to determine which [case] block to execute.
