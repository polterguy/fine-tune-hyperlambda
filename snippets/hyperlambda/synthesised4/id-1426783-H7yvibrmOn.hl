/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the [stream] argument is either explicitly set to false or does not exist at all. It uses the [or] slot to evaluate two conditions: the first condition uses the [eq] slot to check if the [stream] argument is equal to false, and the second condition uses the [not-exists] slot to verify if the [stream] argument is absent. If either condition is true, the [or] slot evaluates to true.
 * 
 * 1. [or] - Evaluates to true if any of its child conditions are true.
 * 2. [eq] - Checks if the [stream] argument is explicitly set to false.
 * 3. [not-exists] - Checks if the [stream] argument does not exist.
