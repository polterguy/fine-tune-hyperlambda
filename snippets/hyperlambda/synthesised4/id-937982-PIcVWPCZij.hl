// The code iterates over each child node of [.data] and concatenates their values into a single string, separated by ", ". The [for-each] slot iterates through each node, [set-value] updates [.result] with the concatenated string, and [strings.concat] combines the current [.result] value with the iterated node's value. The [.dp] node references the current node in the iteration.
