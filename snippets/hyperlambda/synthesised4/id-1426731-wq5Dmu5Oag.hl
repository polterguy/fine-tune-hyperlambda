/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code retrieves all nodes that are descendants of the [urls] node, which is a child of any node under the [signal] node. It uses the [get-nodes] slot to achieve this. The expression [@signal/*/urls/*] specifies the path to the nodes to be retrieved, starting from the [signal] node, traversing through any child node, and then specifically targeting the [urls] node and its children.
 * // 1. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes specified by the lambda expression.
 * // 2. [@signal/*/urls/*] - Lambda expression pointing to nodes under [urls] within the [signal] hierarchy.
