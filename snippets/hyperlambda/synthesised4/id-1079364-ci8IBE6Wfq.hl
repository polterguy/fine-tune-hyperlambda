/*
 * The expression `.:x:@.fields` is a lambda expression in Hyperlambda. Here's a breakdown of its components:
 * 
 * 1. `@` - This is the "name comparison" iterator. It looks for the first node with the specified name in the current context. In this expression, it searches for a node named `.fields`.
 * 
 * 2. `.fields` - This is the name of the node being searched for. The `@` iterator will find the first node with this name in the current context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve a specific configuration or data node named `.fields` in a larger Hyperlambda structure, possibly to manipulate or evaluate its children nodes.
 * - It might be used in a scenario where you need to access a collection of fields or properties defined under a `.fields` node for further processing or validation.
