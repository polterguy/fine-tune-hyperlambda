// This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to update the value of a node named [.completion] by concatenating its current value with a formatted string. The formatted string consists of a newline character followed by a markdown-style link. The link text is obtained from the [name] node, and the URL is derived from the [src] node, both of which are children of the node referenced by [.dp]. This operation effectively appends a markdown link to the existing content of the [.completion] node.
