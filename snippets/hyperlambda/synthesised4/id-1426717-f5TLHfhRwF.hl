 * This Hyperlambda code snippet counts the number of nodes resulting from a [strings.split] operation. It uses the [get-count] slot to determine how many nodes are produced after splitting a string. 
 * 
 * 1. [get-count] - Counts the number of nodes that result from the [strings.split] operation.
 * 2. [strings.split] - The operation whose resulting nodes are being counted.
