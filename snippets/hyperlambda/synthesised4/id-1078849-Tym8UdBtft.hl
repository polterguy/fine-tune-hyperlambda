/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current node's hierarchy. It is used to access the arguments node that is typically present in Hyperlambda structures, especially in HTTP endpoints or dynamic slots.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node, which in this case is the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument node within the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `ml_training_snippets` - This iterator filters the children nodes to only those with the name "ml_training_snippets". It is used to specifically target nodes that are related to machine learning training snippets.
 * 
 * 4. `prompt` - This iterator further filters the nodes to those with the name "prompt" within the "ml_training_snippets" nodes. It is used to access the prompt nodes that are part of the machine learning training snippets.
 * 
 * 5. `like` - This iterator selects nodes with the name "like" within the "prompt" nodes. It is used to access nodes that might contain data or configurations related to "like" operations or preferences within the prompt context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a machine learning application to retrieve specific prompt configurations or data that are marked as "like" within training snippets. 
 * - It might also be used in a system that processes user preferences or feedback related to machine learning prompts, allowing for dynamic adjustments or logging based on user interactions.
