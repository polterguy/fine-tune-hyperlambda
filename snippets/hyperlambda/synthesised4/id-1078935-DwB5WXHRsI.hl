// 1. `@.file-data`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "file-data" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, checking each node's name. If it finds a node named "file-data", it returns that node. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate data stored in a specific node named "file-data" within a larger Hyperlambda structure. A potential use case could be retrieving file metadata or content stored in a node named "file-data" for further processing or validation.
