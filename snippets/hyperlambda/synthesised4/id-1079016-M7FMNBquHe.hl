/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "new-prompt" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve configuration or settings stored in a "new-prompt" node that is located higher up in the hierarchy.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to access a common node shared among multiple child nodes, such as retrieving a template or a default value.
