// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of [add] and [get-nodes] slots. It adds nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] from a specified path within the lambda hierarchy. The [get-nodes] slot fetches nodes from the path [@hyper2lambda/*/.lambda/*], and the [add] slot appends these nodes to the node referenced by [@.x/#].
