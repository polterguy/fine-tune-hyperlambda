// The code retrieves the value of a specific node within a node hierarchy. It uses the [get-value] slot with a lambda expression to navigate through the node structure, starting from the [signal] node, moving to its child [signal] node, then to its children [urls], and finally accessing the value of the first child node of [urls].
