/*
 * 1. `@.more`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "more" that appears before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node named "more". 
 * 
 * Use case: This expression can be used to access configuration or data nodes that are defined earlier in the structure, allowing you to reuse or reference data without duplicating it. For example, if you have a node named "more" containing additional settings or parameters, you can access it from various parts of your Hyperlambda code using this expression.
