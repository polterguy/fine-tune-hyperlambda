/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add the results of executing signals to a specified node. It retrieves the results from the execution of signals and assigns them to a node, while also capturing session information from the arguments. The code uses the [add] slot to append the results and session data to the specified node structure.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds the result of executing signals to the specified node.
 * 2. [.] - Represents a static node where the results will be added.
 * 3. [result] - Retrieves the result of the executed signals.
 * 4. [session] - Captures session information from the arguments.
