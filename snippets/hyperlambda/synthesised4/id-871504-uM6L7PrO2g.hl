/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database using the [data.read] slot. 
 * // It specifies the database type as SQLite and selects data from the "Patients" table. 
 * // The code includes a column with an alias "count" using a distinct functor, and it sets up a [where] condition with an [and] logical operator for filtering results.
 * [data.read] - Initiates the reading of data from a specified database.
 * [database-type] - Specifies the type of database, in this case, SQLite.
 * [table] - Indicates the table from which data is to be selected, here "Patients".
 * [columns] - Lists the columns to be retrieved from the table.
 * [distinct_functor] - Represents a distinct operation on a column, aliased as "count".
 * [where] - Begins a conditional filtering section for the data retrieval.
 * [and] - Logical operator to combine multiple conditions in the [where] clause.
