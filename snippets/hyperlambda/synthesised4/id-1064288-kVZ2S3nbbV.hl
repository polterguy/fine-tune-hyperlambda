/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is useful for accessing any argument nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `offset` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "offset" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target the "offset" argument, which might be used for pagination or indexing purposes in a function or slot.
