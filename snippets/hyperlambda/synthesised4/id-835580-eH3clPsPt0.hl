/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes from the [.arguments] node set to a specific location within a data structure. The [add] slot is used to insert these nodes into the path specified by the expression, which targets the [where] node within a [data.read] operation. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all nodes under [.arguments] to be added. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts nodes into the specified location in the data structure.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node set for insertion.
