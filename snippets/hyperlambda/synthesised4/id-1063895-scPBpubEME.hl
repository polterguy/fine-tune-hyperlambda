// 1. `@.tail`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "tail" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches through siblings and ancestors to find the specified node. This is useful when you need to access a node named "tail" that is located earlier in the structure, possibly to retrieve or manipulate its value or children.
