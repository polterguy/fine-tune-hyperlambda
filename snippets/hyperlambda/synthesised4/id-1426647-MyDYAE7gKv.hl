// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [return] slot to return multiple nodes, specifically [input] and [candidates], from a dynamically created slot or a context that allows returning nodes. The [return] slot is used to output nodes from within a dynamic slot or an explicitly created return context, enabling the encapsulation and return of complex data structures.
