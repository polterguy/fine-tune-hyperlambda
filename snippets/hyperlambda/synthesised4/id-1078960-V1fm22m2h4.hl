/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint. In the context of an HTTP endpoint or a dynamic slot, this is where input parameters are usually stored.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or endpoint, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `images`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `images` among the children of `.arguments`. It is used to specifically target an argument or parameter named `images`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a function or an HTTP endpoint to access an argument named `images` that contains a list or collection of image data. This could be useful for processing or manipulating images uploaded by a user.
 * - It might also be used in a validation routine to ensure that the `images` argument is present and contains the expected data before proceeding with further operations.
