// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [insert-after] slot in Hyperlambda to insert a new node after a specified node. In this example, the [insert-after] slot is used to add a node with the name "approved" and the value "Status updated" immediately after the "pending" node within the "statuses" node. This operation modifies the structure by appending the new node after the targeted node.
insert-after:x:@.statuses/*/pending
