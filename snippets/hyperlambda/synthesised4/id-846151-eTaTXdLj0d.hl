// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL join operation using an alias for the joined table. The [join] slot specifies the table to join, [as] assigns an alias to the joined table, and [on] defines the join condition using [and] to combine multiple conditions. The [eq] slot is used to compare the 'username' column from the 'users' table with the 'user' column from the aliased 'users_extra' table (ue1).
