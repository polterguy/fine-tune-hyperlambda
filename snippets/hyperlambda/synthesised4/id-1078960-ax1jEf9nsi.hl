/*
 * 1. `@.urls`: This iterator searches for the first node named "urls" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a match. This is useful for locating a specific node when you know its name but not its exact location in relation to the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `0`: This iterator retrieves the first child node of the result set from the previous iterator, which in this case would be the first child of the "urls" node. This is useful when you want to access the first item in a list or collection of nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve the first URL from a list of URLs stored under a node named "urls". This might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or display the primary or default URL from a collection.
