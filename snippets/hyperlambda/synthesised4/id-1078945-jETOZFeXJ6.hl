/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context with the name "signal". It is used to locate a specific node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the previously selected node. In this context, it retrieves all children of the "signal" node.
 * 
 * 3. `snippets` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those with the name "snippets". It selects the "snippets" node among the children of the "signal" node.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "snippets" node. It allows access to all nodes that are direct children of the "snippets" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to gather all code snippets or data segments under a "snippets" node, which is itself a child of a "signal" node. This might be useful in a context where "signal" nodes represent different events or actions, and each contains various "snippets" of information or code related to that event.
