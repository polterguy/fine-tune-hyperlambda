// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [if] slot to evaluate a condition. If the condition evaluates to false, the [if] block will not execute its [.lambda] child, which contains a [set-value] slot intended to set the [.result] node's value to "Nested condition met". The [.lambda] node is executed only if the condition is true.
