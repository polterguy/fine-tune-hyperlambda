/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves to the next node below the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the node immediately following the current node in a sequence.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. After moving to the elder sibling with the `+` iterator, the `*` iterator will gather all children of that elder sibling node. This is useful for iterating over or processing all child nodes of a specific elder sibling node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to navigate from a given node to its next sibling and then process or evaluate all children of that sibling. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to apply a certain operation or retrieve data from all children of a specific sibling node in a structured data set.
