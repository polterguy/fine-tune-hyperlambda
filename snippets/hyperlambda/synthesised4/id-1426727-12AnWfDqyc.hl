// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve all nodes named "sitemap" that are children of any node under the "signal" node. The expression "@signal/*/sitemap" specifies the path to these nodes, starting from the "signal" node, then any child node, and finally filtering nodes named "sitemap".
