// This Hyperlambda code uses the [sleep] slot to pause the execution of the current thread for 100 milliseconds. The [sleep] slot is designed to release the thread back to the operating system during the sleep period, making it a non-blocking call that does not consume physical operating system threads while sleeping. This feature is part of Hyperlambda's efficient threading capabilities.
