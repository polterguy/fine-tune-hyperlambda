/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.mixin] slot to combine the result of a specified Hyperlambda expression with a surrounding string. It retrieves the completion nodes from the first child of the [.scan] node and mixes them into the string defined by the [prompt] node from the [.arguments]. The result is a dynamically constructed string where the completion content is embedded within the prompt. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.mixin] - Combines the result of a specified Hyperlambda expression with a surrounding string.
 * 2. [prompt] - Retrieves the value of the [prompt] node from the [.arguments] to use as part of the string.
