// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to insert a new record into a database table named "ml_training_snippets" using the [data.create] slot. The code specifies the table name and a set of values to be inserted, including a type, a prompt, a completion, and a URI. The values are dynamically retrieved or statically defined, ensuring safe insertion into the database by using SQL parameters. The [data.create] slot is crucial for preventing SQL injection attacks by treating all input data as parameters.
