// This Hyperlambda code uses the [validators.regex] slot to ensure that the value of the [email] node within the [.arguments] node matches a regular expression pattern for a valid email format. The regular expression checks for a typical email structure, ensuring the presence of characters before and after the "@" symbol and a domain following a dot. If the value does not match this pattern, an exception will be thrown.
