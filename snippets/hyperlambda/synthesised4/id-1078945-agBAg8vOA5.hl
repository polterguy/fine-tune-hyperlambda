/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to navigate to the top of the node hierarchy from the current node.
 * 2. `/*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the root node. It is used to access every direct child node under the root.
 * 3. `/return` - This filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those named "return". It is used to locate specific nodes by name.
 * 4. `/*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the "return" node. It is used to access every direct child node under the "return" node.
 * 5. `/references` - This filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those named "references". It is used to locate specific nodes by name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to gather all "references" nodes that are children of "return" nodes, starting from the root of the Hyperlambda structure. This might be useful in a scenario where you need to collect or process reference information returned by a function or operation in a Hyperlambda script.
