// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, `Employees` and `ReportsTo`, using the `join` slot. The join is based on matching the `ReportsTo` column from the `Employees` table with the `EmployeeID` column from the `ReportsTo` table. The `as` slot is used to alias the `Employees` table as `ReportsTo` for clarity in the join operation. The `type` slot specifies that this is a left join, meaning all records from the `Employees` table will be included, along with matching records from the `ReportsTo` table. If there is no match, the result will still include the `Employees` record with nulls for columns from the `ReportsTo` table.
