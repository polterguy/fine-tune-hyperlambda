/*
 * 1. `@.tmp`: This iterator searches for the first node named "tmp" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through its ancestors and siblings until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful for accessing a specific node in the hierarchy when you know its name but not its exact position relative to the current node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve configuration or temporary data stored in a node named "tmp" that is part of a larger data structure, allowing for dynamic access to specific parts of the data based on its name.
