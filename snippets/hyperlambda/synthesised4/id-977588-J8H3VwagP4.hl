// This Hyperlambda code connects to the "sakila" database and performs a SQL SELECT query to retrieve the first and last names of actors whose last names match a pattern. The pattern is constructed using the [strings.concat] slot to include wildcard characters (%) around the provided last name argument. The [data.select] slot executes the query with the constructed filter, and the results are returned using the [yield] slot.
