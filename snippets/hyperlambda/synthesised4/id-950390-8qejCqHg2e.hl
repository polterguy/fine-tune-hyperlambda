// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [return] slot to return a single node with a boolean value. The [return] slot is used to exit a function or a dynamically created slot, and in this case, it returns a node named [result] with a boolean value of false. This is useful in scenarios where a function needs to provide a specific outcome or status back to its caller.
