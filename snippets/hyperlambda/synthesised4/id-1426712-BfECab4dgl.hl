/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a signal to a specified session, with an argument indicating that a function is no longer waiting. The signal is sent to all connections associated with the session, and the argument [function_waiting] is set to a boolean value of false, which is transmitted as a JSON object to the subscribers. This mechanism is useful for notifying clients about changes in the server state or the completion of certain operations. 
 * 
 * 1. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to a specified session.
 * 2. [args] - Contains the arguments to be sent with the signal.
 * 3. [function_waiting] - An argument indicating the function is no longer waiting, set to false.
