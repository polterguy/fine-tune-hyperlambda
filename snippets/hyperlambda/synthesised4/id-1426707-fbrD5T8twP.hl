// The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expression provided, and in this case, it evaluates the expression relative to the current node using the "+" iterator, which refers to the next sibling node. The [unwrap] slot is used to forward evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing for dynamic value assignment or transformation within the Hyperlambda graph.
