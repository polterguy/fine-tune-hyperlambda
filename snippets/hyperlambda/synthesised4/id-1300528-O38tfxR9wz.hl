// The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using the [data.read] slot to interact with a SQLite database. The code specifies a table named "Doctors" and aims to retrieve an aggregate value, which is aliased as "result". The [where] clause is included with an [and] condition, although it doesn't specify any conditions within it, indicating that it might be a placeholder for future conditions. The [group] clause groups the results by a specified column named "group_column". Finally, the [return-nodes] slot is used to return all nodes resulting from the [data.read] operation. This setup is useful for retrieving grouped aggregate data from a database, allowing for flexible query construction and result handling in Hyperlambda.
