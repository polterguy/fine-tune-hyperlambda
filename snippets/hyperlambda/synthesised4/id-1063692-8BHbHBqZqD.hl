// 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before in its hierarchy that matches the specified name. In this case, it looks for the first node named "fingerprint" in the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name without traversing the entire structure, allowing for efficient access to nodes that are siblings or ancestors in the hierarchy.
