// This Hyperlambda code snippet returns a set of nodes from a dynamic slot execution. It retrieves the [result] node from the cached signal's output, sets the [finish_reason] to "cached", and specifies that the [stream] is false. The code is typically used in scenarios where the result is fetched from a cached signal, indicating a completed operation without streaming the result.
return
   result:x:@signal/*/cached
   finish_reason:cached
