// Concatenates a multi-line string with trimmed content from a specified node, resulting in a formatted code block. The [strings.concat] slot combines the initial and final triple backticks with the trimmed content from the specified node, effectively creating a code block with the content in between. The [strings.trim] slot removes leading and trailing whitespace from the node's text content.
