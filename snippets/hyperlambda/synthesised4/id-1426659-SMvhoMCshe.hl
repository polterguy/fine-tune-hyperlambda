/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use logical conditions to evaluate nodes. It uses the [and] slot to combine two conditions: [not-null] and [neq]. The [not-null] slot checks if the node referenced by the expression is not null, and the [neq] slot checks if the node's value is not equal to an empty value. If both conditions are true, the [and] slot returns true. This is useful for ensuring that a node has a non-null and non-empty value before performing further operations.
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Combines multiple conditions and returns true if all conditions are true.
 * 2. [not-null] - Evaluates to true if the specified node is not null.
 * 3. [neq] - Evaluates to true if the specified node's value is not equal to the given value (in this case, an empty value).
 * 4. [.:] - Represents an empty value for comparison in the [neq] slot.
