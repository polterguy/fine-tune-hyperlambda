// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [role] node is equal to "admin" using the [eq] slot. If true, it sets the value of the [accessLevel] node to "Full access" using the [set-value] slot. The [if] slot is used to conditionally execute the [set-value] operation based on the equality check.
