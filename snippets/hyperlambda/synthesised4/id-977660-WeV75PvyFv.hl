// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [while] loop to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true. It checks if the value of [.no] is less than 20 using [lt], and if true, logs a message and increments [.no] by 1 using [math.increment]. The loop continues until the condition is no longer met.
