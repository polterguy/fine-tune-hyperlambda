// Concatenates a series of strings into a single string, including a dynamic value retrieved from an HTTP GET response's Location header. The [strings.concat] slot combines static text with the result of a [get-value] slot, which extracts the Location header value from an HTTP GET response, forming a complete message about a page being moved.
