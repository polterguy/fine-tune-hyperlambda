/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement with multiple [case] conditions and a [default] case. It evaluates the value of the [.input] node and executes different logic based on its value. If [.input] is "apple", it sets [.result] to "Fruit". If [.input] is "carrot", it sets [.result] to "Vegetable". If [.input] is "chicken", it sets [.result] to "Meat". If [.input] does not match any of these cases, the [default] case sets [.result] to "Unknown".
 * 
 * 1. [.input] - Node containing the value to be evaluated in the [switch] statement.
 * 2. [switch] - Slot that evaluates the value of [.input] and determines which [case] or [default] to execute.
 * 3. [case] - Slot that specifies a condition to match against the [.input] value.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Lambda object executed if the corresponding [case] condition is true.
 * 5. [set-value] - Slot that sets the value of [.result] based on the matched [case].
 * 6. [default] - Slot executed if none of the [case] conditions are true.
 * 7. [.result] - Node where the result of the [switch] evaluation is stored.
