// 1. `@.fields` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "fields" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node named "fields". This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located at a higher level in the hierarchy or among siblings, and you want to ensure you get the first occurrence of that node.
