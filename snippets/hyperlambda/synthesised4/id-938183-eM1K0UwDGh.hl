// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot in Hyperlambda to retrieve the type of a node's value. It first sets a node [.foo] with an integer value of 57, and then uses the [type] slot to determine and return the type of the [.foo] node's value, which is "int". The [type] slot evaluates its expression and outputs the type name of the specified node's value.
