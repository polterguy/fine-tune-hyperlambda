/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing the node where arguments for a function or slot are typically stored, especially in the context of Hyperlambda where arguments are often passed in a structured format.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is commonly used to access each individual argument passed to a slot or function, allowing for operations or evaluations on each argument.
 * 
 * 3. `/defaultValue` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "defaultValue" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is typically used to access a specific argument or parameter that has been named "defaultValue", which might represent a fallback or default setting in a function or slot execution.
