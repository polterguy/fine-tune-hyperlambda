// The [and] slot in Hyperlambda is used for logical conjunction, requiring all its child conditions to evaluate to true for the [and] slot itself to return true. It short-circuits upon encountering a false condition, meaning it stops evaluating further conditions once a false is found, optimizing performance. This slot is useful in constructing complex logical expressions where multiple conditions must be simultaneously satisfied.
