// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [status] node is equal to "active". If the condition is true, it sets the value of the [display-class] node to "green". The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, and the [eq] slot is used to compare the values. The [set-value] slot updates the [display-class] node based on the condition.
