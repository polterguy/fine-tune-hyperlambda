// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [context] and [get-context] slots. The [context] slot is used to add an object named "foo" with a value of "bar" to the context stack. Inside the [.lambda], the [set-value] slot assigns the value retrieved by [get-context] for the context object "foo" to the [.result] node. This allows for accessing context-specific data within a lambda execution.
context:foo
   value:bar
   .lambda
      set-value:x:@.result
         get-context:foo
