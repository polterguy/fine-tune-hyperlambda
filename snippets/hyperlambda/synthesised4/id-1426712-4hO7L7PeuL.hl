/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a new node structure into the [.session] node. It creates a nested node with a [.role] node having the value "assistant" and a [.content] node whose value is dynamically retrieved from the [.prompt] node, which is a child of the currently iterated node referenced by [.dp]. The [.dp] node is typically used in iterations or dynamic slot executions to refer to the current node being processed. This structure is useful for dynamically building or modifying session data based on existing node values. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds new nodes to the [.session] node.
 * 2. [.] - Creates a new child node under the [.session] node.
 * 3. [.] - Creates a nested node under the previous node.
 * 4. [role] - Sets the role of the node to "assistant".
 * 5. [content] - Sets the content of the node to the value of the [.prompt] node from the current [.dp] node.
