/*
 * 1. `@csv2lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "csv2lambda" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for finding a specific node that might be a parent or an ancestor in the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node found by the previous iterator. In this context, it will get all the direct children nodes of the "csv2lambda" node. This is useful for accessing all elements contained within a specific node, allowing for operations on each child node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of each node returned by the previous `*` iterator. This means it will get all the grandchildren of the "csv2lambda" node. This is useful for deep traversal of the node structure, especially when you need to access nested elements.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to process or manipulate data that is structured in a hierarchical format, such as a CSV converted to a lambda structure, where "csv2lambda" is the root node and the data is nested within it.
 * - It can be used in scenarios where you need to apply a transformation or extract information from all levels of a nested data structure starting from a specific root node.
