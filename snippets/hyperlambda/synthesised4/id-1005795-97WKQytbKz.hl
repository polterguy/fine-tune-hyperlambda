/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is commonly used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint, which typically contains input parameters or configuration data.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each individual argument or parameter passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `completed` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `completed` among the children of the `.arguments` node. It is useful for checking or retrieving the value of a specific argument named `completed`, which might indicate whether a task or process has been completed.
