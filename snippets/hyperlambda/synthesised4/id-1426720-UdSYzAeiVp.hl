// The [type] slot in Hyperlambda returns the type name of a specified value. In the provided example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer value of 57. By using the [type] slot with an expression pointing to the previous node [-], it retrieves and returns the type of the [.foo] node, which is "int". This allows you to dynamically determine and work with the type of values within your Hyperlambda code.
