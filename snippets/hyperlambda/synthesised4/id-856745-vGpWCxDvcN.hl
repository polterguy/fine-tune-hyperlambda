/*
 * This Hyperlambda code defines a signal named [magic.ai.create-search-context] that is used to create a search context for an AI query. It takes three parameters: [query] which is the search query, [max_tokens] which limits the token count to 5000, and [session] which refers to the user's session. The signal is likely used to prepare a search context for AI processing, ensuring that the query and session information are properly encapsulated.
 * 
 * 1. [signal:magic.ai.create-search-context] - Declares a signal to create a search context for AI.
 * 2. [query:x:@.arguments/*/query] - Retrieves the search query from the arguments.
 * 3. [max_tokens:int:5000] - Sets a maximum token limit of 5000 for the search context.
 * 4. [session:x:@.arguments/*/session] - Retrieves the session information from the arguments.
