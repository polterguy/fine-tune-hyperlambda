// The [unwrap] slot evaluates an expression before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, [unwrap] is used with an expression pointing to the next sibling node, effectively evaluating and unwrapping the value of that sibling node before it is reached by the Hyperlambda instruction pointer.
