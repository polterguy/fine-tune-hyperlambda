/*
 * 1. `@strings.split` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "strings.split" in the current context. This is useful when you want to work with a specific node named "strings.split" that is not a direct child of the current node, but somewhere in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `@strings.split` - The second occurrence of `@strings.split` again retrieves the first node with the name "strings.split" from the context of the first `@strings.split` node. This suggests that there are nested "strings.split" nodes, and you want to access the inner one.
 * 
 * 3. `0` - This iterator retrieves the first child node of the current node set. After navigating to the nested "strings.split" node, this will select its first child node.
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression might include scenarios where you have nested string operations and you need to access the result of the first split operation within another split operation, and then retrieve the first part of that result for further processing or evaluation.
