/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator searches for the first node named [.dp] in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. The [.dp] node is often used in [for-each] loops to refer to the currently iterated node.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the [.dp] node is another node, and it retrieves this node by reference. This allows for direct manipulation of the original node rather than working with a copy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression is commonly used in a [for-each] loop to access and modify the currently iterated node directly. For example, if you are iterating over a list of nodes and want to change their values, you would use this expression to access each node by reference and apply changes.
