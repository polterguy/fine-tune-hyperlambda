// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, [unwrap] is applied with an expression pointing to the node's younger sibling and all its descendants. This allows for the forward evaluation of expressions in the lambda object, ensuring that any expressions are evaluated and their results are used before the node is actually executed.
