/*
 * 1. `@.finish_reason`: This iterator starts with an `@` symbol, which indicates that it will search for the first node named `finish_reason` within the current context. The `.` following the `@` symbol specifies that the search should begin from the current node's parent. This expression is useful for retrieving the `finish_reason` node from the current context, which might be used to determine the outcome or status of a process or operation. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Checking the completion status of a task or operation in a workflow.
 * - Determining the reason for the termination of a process in a logging or auditing system.
