// This Hyperlambda code sets a random cryptographic string as the value for a node located at a specific path. It uses the [crypto.random] slot to generate a secure random string with a length between 100 and 200 characters, which is then assigned to the [secret] node under the specified path using the [set-value] slot. This ensures that the secret is both unpredictable and secure.
