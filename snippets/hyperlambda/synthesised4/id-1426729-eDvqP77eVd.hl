// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] block to define a specific condition that, if matched, will execute its associated lambda object. Each [case] node must have a value, which can be a constant or an expression, and the [switch] will evaluate its expression to find the first matching [case] node to execute.
