/*
 * The code establishes a connection to a SQLite database named "northwind" and prepares to delete records from the "CustomerDemographics" table. It dynamically adds conditions to the "where" clause from the provided arguments and executes the deletion. Finally, it returns the number of affected rows. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.connect] - Opens a connection to the "northwind" SQLite database.
 * 2. [database-type] - Specifies the database type as SQLite.
 * 3. [add] - Adds conditions to the "where" clause from the arguments.
 * 4. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the arguments to be added to the "where" clause.
 * 5. [data.delete] - Deletes records from the "CustomerDemographics" table.
 * 6. [table] - Specifies the table from which records are to be deleted.
 * 7. [where] - Begins the "where" clause for the delete operation.
 * 8. [and] - Logical AND for combining conditions in the "where" clause.
 * 9. [unwrap] - Evaluates and executes the nodes added to the "where" clause.
 * 10. [return] - Returns the number of affected rows from the delete operation.
 * 11. [affected] - Retrieves the number of rows affected by the delete operation.
