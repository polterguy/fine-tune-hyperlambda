/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [eq] slot to check if the value of the node referenced by the expression is equal to a specified static value. Here, [eq] compares the value of [.user-input] with an unspecified value, which should be provided as a child node. If the values match, [eq] evaluates to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [eq] - Compares two values for equality.
 * 2. [get-value:x:@.user-input] - Retrieves the value of the [.user-input] node.
 * 3. [.:] - Represents the static value to compare against, which should be specified.
