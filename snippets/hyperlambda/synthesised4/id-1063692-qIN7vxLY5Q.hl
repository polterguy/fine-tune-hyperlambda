/*
 * 1. `@crypto.rsa.create-key` - This iterator searches for the first node named `crypto.rsa.create-key` in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `crypto.rsa.create-key` node. It allows access to any node directly under `crypto.rsa.create-key`.
 * 
 * 3. `fingerprint` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `fingerprint` among the children of `crypto.rsa.create-key`. It effectively selects the `fingerprint` node from the children nodes of `crypto.rsa.create-key`.
 * 
 * This expression is used to navigate through a node structure to find a specific `fingerprint` node that is a child of a `crypto.rsa.create-key` node. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to access or manipulate the fingerprint of a newly created RSA key within a Hyperlambda graph.
