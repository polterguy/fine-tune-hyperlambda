// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to insert a new record into a "users" table using the [data.create] slot. It specifies the table name as "users" and defines the [values] node with fields "name" and "email", which are dynamically set using lambda expressions to retrieve values from the [.arguments] node. This ensures that the actual values for "name" and "email" are supplied at runtime, promoting flexibility and security by preventing SQL injection.
data.create
   table:users

      name:x:@.arguments/*/name
      email:x:@.arguments/*/email
