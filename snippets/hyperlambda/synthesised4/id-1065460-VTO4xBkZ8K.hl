// 1. `@.fields`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "fields" that is a sibling or a child of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` before "fields" specifies that it searches within the current context or node hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the "fields" node directly, perhaps to read its value or modify its children.
