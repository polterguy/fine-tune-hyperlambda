// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of a [try] block to handle exceptions. Inside the [try] block, a [throw] slot is used to raise an exception with the message "Some error is thrown here". This setup is typically followed by [.catch] and [.finally] blocks to manage the exception and execute final cleanup actions, although they are not shown in this snippet.
try
   throw:Some error is thrown here
