// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to delete records from the "accounts" table in a MySQL database where the status is "inactive". The [mysql.delete] slot is used to specify the table and the [where] clause, which includes a condition using [and] and [status.eq] to filter records with a status of "inactive".
mysql.delete
   table:accounts
   where
      and
         status.eq:inactive
