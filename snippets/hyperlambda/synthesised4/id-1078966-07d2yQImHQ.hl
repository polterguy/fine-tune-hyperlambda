/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It allows you to access all the arguments provided to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `code` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `code`. It is used to specifically access the argument named `code` among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to retrieve the value of an argument named `code` that has been passed to it. This is useful in scenarios where you need to process or evaluate a specific piece of code or script provided as an argument to a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint.
