// 1. `@.no-endpoints`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no-endpoints" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings but only direct ancestors. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to verify or retrieve configuration settings or flags that are defined at a higher level in the node hierarchy, such as checking for a global setting that disables certain features or endpoints.
