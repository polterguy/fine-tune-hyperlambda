// The code iterates over each node in the [.snippets] collection and creates a new record in the [ml_training_snippets] table for each node. It uses the [data.create] slot to insert values into the table, extracting data from the current node being iterated. The fields inserted include [type], [prompt], [completion], [filename], and a static value [cached] set to 0. The [for-each] slot ensures each snippet is processed, and the [data.create] slot handles the database insertion.
