// The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expression provided in its value before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this case, the expression `+/**` is evaluated, which retrieves all descendant nodes of the current node, including the node itself, using a breadth-first algorithm. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions within a lambda object before execution.
