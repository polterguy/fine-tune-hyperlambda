/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the node referenced by [@.outgoing] to the first value obtained from two sources. It retrieves the value from the [webhook_outgoing] node within [.arguments] and the configuration value from "magic:openai:integrations:outgoing:slot". The [get-first-value] slot ensures that only the first available value from these sources is used. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [@.outgoing] - The node whose value is being set.
 * 3. [get-first-value] - Retrieves the first available value from its children nodes.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the specified node.
 * 5. [@.arguments/*/webhook_outgoing] - The node path to retrieve the first value from.
 * 6. [config.get] - Retrieves a configuration value.
 * 7. ["magic:openai:integrations:outgoing:slot"] - The configuration key to retrieve the second value from.
