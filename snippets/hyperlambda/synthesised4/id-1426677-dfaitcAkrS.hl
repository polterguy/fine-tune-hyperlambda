// The [unwrap] slot in this Hyperlambda code is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. By using the expression "x:+/*", it evaluates the current node's elder sibling and all its children, effectively "unwrapping" these nodes and their values before proceeding. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions within a lambda object, ensuring that the values are resolved and available before the lambda object is executed.
