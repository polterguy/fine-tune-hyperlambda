/*
 * This Hyperlambda code defines a signal for scraping a URL using the "magic.ai.url.scrape" slot. It takes various parameters such as [url], [type], and [threshold] from the arguments node, and includes options to scrape images, code, lists, and the main content. It also specifies whether to allow empty completions and includes a feedback channel for the operation.
 * 
 * 1. [url] - Specifies the URL to scrape.
 * 2. [type] - Determines the type of content to scrape.
 * 3. [images] - Boolean flag to include images in the scrape.
 * 4. [code] - Boolean flag to include code in the scrape.
 * 5. [lists] - Boolean flag to include lists in the scrape.
 * 6. [main] - Boolean flag to include the main content in the scrape.
 * 7. [empty-completion] - Boolean flag to allow empty completions.
 * 8. [threshold] - Sets a threshold value for the scraping operation.
 * 9. [summarize] - Option to summarize the scraped content.
 * 10. [feedback-channel] - Specifies a feedback channel for the operation.
