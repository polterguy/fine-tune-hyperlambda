// The code snippet demonstrates the execution of a specific task using the [tasks.execute] slot in Hyperlambda. This slot is used to explicitly run a persisted task by referencing its unique identifier. In this case, the task with the ID "sqlite.create-backup" is being executed. This functionality is crucial for triggering scheduled or manual tasks that have been previously defined and stored in the system. If the specified task does not exist, an exception will be thrown, ensuring that only valid tasks are executed.
