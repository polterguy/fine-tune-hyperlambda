/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. The "@" symbol signifies that it is looking for a node by name.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It allows access to each individual child node under "arguments".
 * 3. `indexed` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "indexed" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It ensures that only nodes with the name "indexed" are selected. 
 * 
 * This expression is useful for accessing specific nodes within a structured data set, particularly when you want to retrieve nodes named "indexed" that are children of an "arguments" node.
