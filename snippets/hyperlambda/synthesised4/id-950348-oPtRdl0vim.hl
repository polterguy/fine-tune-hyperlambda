// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to increment the value of a node using the [math.increment] slot. The [math.increment] slot takes an expression pointing to a node, in this case [@.count], and increases its value by 1. If a specific increment step is needed, it can be provided as a child node, but in this example, the default step of 1 is used.
math.increment:x:@.count
