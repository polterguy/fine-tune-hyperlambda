/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code checks if the node referenced by the expression [@.crawl-delay] exists and has a value. If the node exists and has a non-null value, the [not-null] slot will evaluate to true. Otherwise, it will evaluate to false. This is useful for validating the presence and value of nodes in a Hyperlambda graph structure. 
 * // 1. [not-null] - Evaluates whether the node specified by the expression has a non-null value.
 * // 2. [x:@.crawl-delay] - Expression pointing to the node whose existence and value are being checked.
