// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, it evaluates the expression [x:+/*/*/message] and assigns the resulting value to the node where [unwrap] is invoked. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions in a lambda object.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/message
