// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" that is either at the current level or higher up in the hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates that the search is for a node by name, and the `.` following it specifies that the search should begin at the current node level. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node that might be a sibling or an ancestor in the current context, particularly when dealing with SQL queries or commands stored in a node named "sql".
