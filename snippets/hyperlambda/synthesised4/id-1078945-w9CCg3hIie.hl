// 1. `@.finish_reason` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "finish_reason" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful in scenarios where you need to check or use the value of a node named "finish_reason" that might be part of a larger structure, such as determining the reason why a process or operation was completed in a workflow or task management system.
