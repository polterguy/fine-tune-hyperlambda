/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node(s). In this context, it retrieves all children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `ml_training_snippets.uri.like` - This iterator filters the previously selected nodes to find the first node with the name "ml_training_snippets.uri.like". It is used to access a specific argument or data point within the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * **Use Cases:**
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to access a specific URI or identifier related to machine learning training snippets, possibly to perform operations like filtering, validation, or processing based on this URI. 
 * - It might be used in a scenario where you need to check or manipulate the URI of a training snippet to ensure it meets certain criteria or to fetch additional data related to it.
