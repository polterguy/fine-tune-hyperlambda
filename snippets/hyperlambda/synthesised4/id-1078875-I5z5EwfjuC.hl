/*
 * 1. `@strings.split`: This iterator searches for the first node named "strings.split" in the current context. It starts from the root of the current node hierarchy and looks for a node with this specific name. The `@` symbol indicates that it will not traverse siblings but will search for the node in the current hierarchy. This is useful when you need to find a specific operation or function node that performs a string split operation.
 * 
 * 2. `1`: This iterator retrieves the first child node of the previously found "strings.split" node. The number `1` indicates that it is looking for the first child node in the sequence. This can be useful if you want to access a specific part of the result of the string split operation, such as the first element of the split string.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access the first element of a string that has been split into parts by a delimiter. For example, if you have a string "apple,banana,cherry" and you use `strings.split` to split it by the comma, this expression would retrieve "apple".
 * - It can be used in scenarios where you need to process or manipulate the first part of a split string, such as extracting a username from an email address or a domain from a URL.
