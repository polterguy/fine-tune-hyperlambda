// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to dynamically add nodes to a destination node's children collection using the [add] slot. It targets the [.session] node and appends a new node structure containing a [role] node with the value "user" and a [content] node. The [content] node's value is derived from the [completion] node within the current [.dp] node, accessed by reference. This approach allows for the dynamic construction and modification of node structures based on existing data.
