// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a block of code when previous conditions are not met. It uses [set-value] to update the value of nodes within [.result] by adding 1 to their current values. The [math.add] slot performs the addition, and [get-value] retrieves the current values of the nodes identified by [@get-name].
