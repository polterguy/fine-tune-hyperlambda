/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node, which is the node immediately following the current node in the Hyperlambda structure. Use cases for this iterator include scenarios where you need to access or manipulate the next node in sequence relative to the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It is used to access every child node of a given parent node, which can be useful for iterating over or processing each child node under a specific parent node.
