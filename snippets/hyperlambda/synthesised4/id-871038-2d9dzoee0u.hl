// This Hyperlambda code uses the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions: it checks if a node named "nullable" exists within the [.arguments] node using [exists], and then verifies if the value of this "nullable" node is equal to false using [eq]. Both conditions must be true for the [and] slot to evaluate to true.
