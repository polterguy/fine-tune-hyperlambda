/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy until it finds a match. This is useful for locating a specific node by name when you are unsure of its exact position in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "hyper2lambda" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing you to perform operations on or extract information from each child node.
 * 
 * 3. `status` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "status" among the children of the "hyper2lambda" node. This is useful for isolating specific nodes by name from a larger set of nodes, allowing for focused operations or data retrieval.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to check the status of various components or processes defined under a "hyper2lambda" node in a configuration or monitoring system.
 * - It can be employed in a logging or auditing system to retrieve and log the status of different operations or tasks for further analysis.
