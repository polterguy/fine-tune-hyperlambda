/*
 * 1. `@.reference`: This iterator searches for the first node named "reference" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first match it finds, which is useful for accessing specific nodes that are ancestors of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "reference" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing you to perform operations or further filtering on them.
 * 
 * 3. `session`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "session" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to narrow down the node set to specific nodes of interest, in this case, those named "session".
