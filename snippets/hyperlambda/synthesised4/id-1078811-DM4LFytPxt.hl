// 1. `@.slot`: This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "slot" that is an ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` indicates it will start the search from the current node and move upwards through its ancestors. This is useful when you want to access a specific node that is hierarchically above the current node, such as retrieving configuration or context information stored in a parent node.
