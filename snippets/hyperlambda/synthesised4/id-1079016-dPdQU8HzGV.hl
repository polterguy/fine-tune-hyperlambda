/*
 * 1. `@.iterations`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "iterations" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. It starts its search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access a specific node that might be located at any level above the current node in the structure, allowing you to dynamically reference nodes without knowing their exact position relative to the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: If you are within a loop or a nested structure and need to access a node that keeps track of the number of iterations or a similar counter, this expression would allow you to find and manipulate that node regardless of your current depth in the hierarchy.
