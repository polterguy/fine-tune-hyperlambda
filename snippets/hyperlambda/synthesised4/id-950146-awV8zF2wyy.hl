// The code uses the [strings.mixin] slot to combine the results of inline Hyperlambda expressions into a string. It calculates the sum of 1 and 2 using [math.add] and the product of 3 and 4 using [math.multiply], embedding these results into the surrounding string. The final output is a string that includes both the calculated sum and product.
strings.mixin:@"Sum {{
math.add
   .:int:1
   .:int:2
return:x:-
}} and Product {{
math.multiply
