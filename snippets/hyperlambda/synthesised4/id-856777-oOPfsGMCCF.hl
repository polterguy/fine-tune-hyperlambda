// The code snippet uses the [not-exists] slot to evaluate whether any nodes exist at the specified path. It checks if there are zero results for the expression targeting the children of the [urls] node, with a specific condition involving the value of the currently iterated node. If no such nodes exist, it returns true. The expression combines node path traversal and dynamic value referencing to perform this check.
