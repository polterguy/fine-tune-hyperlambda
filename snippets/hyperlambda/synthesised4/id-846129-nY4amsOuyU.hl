// The code uses [strings.split] to divide a string into multiple parts based on a delimiter, and then [strings.join] to concatenate these parts back together without any separator, effectively removing the original delimiter. The [strings.split] slot splits the string into nodes, and [strings.join] combines these nodes into a single string.
