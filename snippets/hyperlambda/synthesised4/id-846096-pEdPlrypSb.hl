// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [get-first-value] slot to retrieve the first non-null value from a set of evaluated expressions. It first attempts to get the value of the [button] node within the [.arguments] node. If this value is null, it defaults to the static value provided as a child node. This approach is useful for setting default values or ensuring a single non-null value is returned from multiple potential sources.
