// This Hyperlambda code snippet executes a SQL read operation on the "ml_types" table, selecting the "vector_model" column. It includes a "where" clause that filters results based on the equality of the "type" column with a provided argument value. The [data.read] slot is used to perform the database query, and the [where] clause specifies the condition for filtering the results.
