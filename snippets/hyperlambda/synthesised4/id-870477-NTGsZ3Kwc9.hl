/*
 * This code snippet demonstrates how to change the names of all nodes referenced by its expression to the value obtained from the [get-name] slot. The [set-name] slot is used to modify the names of nodes, and it takes the result of the [get-name] slot as its source, which retrieves the name of the node it points to. The expression in [set-name] targets specific nodes for renaming.
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the name of nodes specified by its expression.
 * 2. [get-name] - Retrieves the name of the node referenced in its expression.
