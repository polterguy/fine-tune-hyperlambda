// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [session] exists within the [.arguments] node and ensures that the [session] node is not null. It uses the [and] slot to combine these two conditions, meaning both must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. Specifically, the [exists] slot verifies the presence of the [session] node, while the [not-null] slot confirms that the [session] node has a non-null value.
