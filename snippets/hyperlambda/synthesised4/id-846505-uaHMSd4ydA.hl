// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Products" and "Categories". The join condition is specified using the [on] slot, where the "ProductID" from the "Products" table is matched with the "CategoryID" from the "Categories" table. The [as] slot is used to alias the "Categories" table as "ProductID". This setup allows for retrieving records from the "Products" table along with matching records from the "Categories" table, including all records from "Products" even if there is no match in "Categories".
join:Categories
   as:ProductID
   type:left
   on
      and
         Products.ProductID:ProductID.CategoryID
