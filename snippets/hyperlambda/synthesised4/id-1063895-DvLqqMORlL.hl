// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that the search is for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that the search is within the current node's children. This expression is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate the "sql" node specifically, perhaps to execute a SQL query or to modify its value or children nodes.
