/*
 * 1. `@sort`: This iterator searches for the first node named "sort" in the current context. It begins its search from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful for locating specific nodes that might be used to define sorting criteria or parameters in a larger data structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: Once the "sort" node is found, this iterator retrieves all of its children nodes. This is useful for accessing the elements that need to be sorted or processed further. It allows you to work with all the child nodes of the "sort" node, which could represent individual items or properties that need to be considered in a sorting operation.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to dynamically sort a list of items based on criteria defined within a "sort" node. For example, in a data processing pipeline, you might have a "sort" node specifying the fields or properties by which a dataset should be sorted, and this expression would help you access those fields.
 * - Another use case could be in a configuration setting where the "sort" node holds various sorting options or parameters, and you need to retrieve all these options to apply them to a dataset or a list.
