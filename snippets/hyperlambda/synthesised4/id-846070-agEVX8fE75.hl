// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a block of code if previous conditions are not met. Within this block, it uses [set-value] to update the [.completion] node by concatenating its current value with a trimmed and replaced version of a string. The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate strings, while [strings.trim] and [strings.replace] are applied to modify the string by removing specific characters and replacing sequences of whitespace.
