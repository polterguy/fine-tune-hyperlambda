// This Hyperlambda code uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a message to a specified feedback channel. It constructs a JSON object with two properties: [message], which contains a success message, and [type], which specifies the message type as "info". The target channel for the message is dynamically determined from the [feedback-channel] argument.
