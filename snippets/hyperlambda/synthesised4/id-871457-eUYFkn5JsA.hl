// This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL read operation on a SQLite database, targeting the "leads" table. It uses a left join to connect the "clients" table based on matching "client_id" fields. The code specifies an aggregate function to be used on columns, aliasing the result as "result". It includes a "where" clause with an "and" condition, though specific conditions aren't detailed. The query limits the result to one record.
