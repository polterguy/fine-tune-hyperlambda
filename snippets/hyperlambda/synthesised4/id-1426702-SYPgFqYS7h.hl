// The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [type] slot to declare the type of a node's value. The [type] slot is used to specify the data type of a node, ensuring that the value assigned to the node is of the correct type. This helps in maintaining data integrity and consistency within the Hyperlambda code. The example illustrates how to declare a node with a specific type, such as int, string, or date, and assign a value to it.
