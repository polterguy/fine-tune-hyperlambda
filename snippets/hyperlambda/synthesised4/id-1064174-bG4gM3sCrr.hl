/*
 * 1. `@data.connect` - This iterator looks for the first node named `data.connect` in the current scope. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for finding a specific node that might be a sibling or an ancestor in the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously matched node, which in this case is the node found by `@data.connect`. It allows you to access all direct descendants of the `data.connect` node.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find those specifically named `data.read`. It narrows down the node set to only those with this exact name.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this retrieves all children nodes of the previously matched `data.read` nodes. It allows further traversal down the hierarchy to access deeper levels of the node structure.
 * 
 * 5. `group` - This iterator filters the children nodes of `data.read` to find nodes named `group`. It focuses the search on nodes that are specifically named `group`.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the previously matched `group` nodes. It allows you to access all direct descendants of the `group` nodes.
 * 
 * 7. `group_column` - This final iterator filters the children nodes of `group` to find those named `group_column`. It identifies the specific nodes of interest that are named `group_column`.
 * 
 * This expression is useful for navigating a structured data hierarchy where you need to access specific nodes based on their names and their position within the hierarchy. It can be used in scenarios where data is organized in a nested fashion, and you need to extract or manipulate specific parts of the data structure.
