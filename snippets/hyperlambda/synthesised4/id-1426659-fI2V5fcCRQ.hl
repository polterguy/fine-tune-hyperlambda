// This Hyperlambda code performs a comparison to check if the status code returned from an HTTP GET request is less than 300. If the condition is true, it implies that the HTTP request was successful, as status codes below 300 generally indicate success. The [lt] slot is used to compare the status code obtained from the [http.get] request with the integer value 300.
