// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the name of nodes referenced by its expression to a concatenated string. It uses [set-name] to target nodes under [data.read] with a specific path, and [strings.concat] to construct a new name by combining the string "count(distinct ", the value of [distinct_column] from [.arguments], and a closing parenthesis.
