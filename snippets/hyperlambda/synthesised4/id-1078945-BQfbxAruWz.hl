/*
 * 1. `@.iterations`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "iterations" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that it will start the search from the current node's parent. This means it will look for the first "iterations" node that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. 
 * 
 * Use case: This expression can be used to retrieve a node named "iterations" that is part of the current execution context, possibly to determine how many times a loop should execute or to access iteration-specific data.
