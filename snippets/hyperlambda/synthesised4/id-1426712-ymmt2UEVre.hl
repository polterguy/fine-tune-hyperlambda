/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet concatenates a string message and assigns it to the [.new-prompt] node. It constructs a message that includes a response from a workflow execution, formatted as JSON. The message is built using several components: a static string indicating the start of a response, the name of the workflow, the JSON response, and additional formatting elements like new lines and backticks for code block formatting. The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate these components, and the [set-value] slot assigns the resulting string to the [.new-prompt] node.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Assigns the concatenated string to the [.new-prompt] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple string components into a single string.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.new-prompt] - Retrieves the current value of the [.new-prompt] node.
 * 4. [get-value:x:@execute/*/workflow] - Retrieves the name of the workflow from the execution node.
 * 5. [get-value:x:@lambda2json] - Retrieves the JSON response from the [lambda2json] node.
 * 6. [.] - Static string components used in the concatenation, including formatting elements like new lines and backticks.
