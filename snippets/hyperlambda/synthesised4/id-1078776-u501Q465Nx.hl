/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator looks for the first node named "signal" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. It allows access to any direct descendants of the "signal" node.
 * 
 * 3. `fingerprint` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "fingerprint" among the children of the "signal" node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * 
 * - This expression can be used to extract or manipulate data related to "fingerprint" nodes within a "signal" node structure, which might be useful in scenarios involving signal processing or biometric data handling.
 * - It could be utilized in a logging or monitoring system to identify and process specific "fingerprint" data associated with a "signal" node, possibly for security or identification purposes.
