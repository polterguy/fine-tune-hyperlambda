// The code snippet uses the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the value of the [distinct_column] node is one of the specified legal values. It checks if the [distinct_column] is one of the columns from the "clients" table, such as "client_id", "name", "email", "phone", or "address", and throws an exception if it is not.
