// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the usage of [strings.concat] to concatenate strings, including a value retrieved from the [.arguments] node. It constructs a string by combining a static part "[generic|" with a dynamic value obtained from the [database] argument, and appends a closing bracket "]". This is useful for dynamically constructing strings based on input parameters.
