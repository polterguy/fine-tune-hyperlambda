/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to replace a placeholder string within a target string with a dynamic value obtained from a specified node. The [strings.replace] slot is used to search for a specific substring within a string and replace it with another value. In this example, the placeholder "[[version]]" within the target string is replaced with the first value found in the [version] node under the [.arguments] node. The [get-first-value] slot is used to retrieve the first value from the specified node path, ensuring that the correct value is used for the replacement. This approach is useful for dynamically updating strings with values from a data structure.
 * 
 * 1. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a specified substring within a string with another value.
 * 2. [.] - Specifies the substring to be replaced, in this case, "[[version]]".
 * 3. [get-first-value] - Retrieves the first value from the specified node path.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression.
 * 5. [v] - Represents a node under [.arguments] from which the version value is retrieved.
 * 6. [version] - The node containing the version value to be used for replacement.
