// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. It uses the "@" symbol to specify that it should search for a node with the exact name "sql". The "." before "sql" indicates that it should start the search from the current node's context. This iterator is useful when you need to access or manipulate a node specifically named "sql" within the current scope, such as retrieving SQL query strings or configurations stored in a node named "sql".
