// The [case] slot is used within a [switch] block to define a specific condition that, when matched with the evaluated value of the [switch] node, triggers the execution of the [case] node's children. Each [case] node must have a value, which can be a constant or an expression, and it is executed as a lambda object if its value matches the [switch] expression. If no [case] matches, an optional [default] node can be executed.
