/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate up one level in the hierarchy. In this context, it starts the expression from the parent node of wherever this expression is being evaluated.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. After moving up to the parent node with `.`, this retrieves all the children of that parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `add` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "add". It is used to specifically target nodes named "add" among the children of the parent node.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "add" nodes. It is used to further navigate into the hierarchy under each "add" node.
 * 
 * 5. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It continues the navigation deeper into the hierarchy, retrieving all children of the nodes found in the previous step.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set, going even deeper into the hierarchy to access all children of the nodes from the previous step.
 * 
 * Potential Use Cases:
 * - This expression could be used to gather all nodes at a specific depth under nodes named "add", which might represent a specific operation or data structure in a larger Hyperlambda graph. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze deeply nested data structures that are organized under "add" operations, such as aggregating data or performing batch operations on a collection of nodes.
