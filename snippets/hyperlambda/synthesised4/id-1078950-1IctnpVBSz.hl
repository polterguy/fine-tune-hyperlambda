/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.dp` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it should look for a node with this specific name. This is typically used to reference a node that is passed by reference, often in loops or dynamic slot executions.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the `.dp` node. It assumes that the value of the `.dp` node is another node, and it retrieves this node by reference. This is useful when you need to manipulate or access the original node rather than a copy.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It is used to access the children of the node that was de-referenced in the previous step.
 * 
 * 4. `uri` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `uri`. It selects nodes among the children of the de-referenced node that have the name `uri`.
 * 
 * Potential Use Cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you are iterating over a collection of nodes, and each node has a `.dp` reference pointing to another node structure. You want to access and process the `uri` child node of each referenced node, perhaps to extract or manipulate URI information for further processing or validation.
