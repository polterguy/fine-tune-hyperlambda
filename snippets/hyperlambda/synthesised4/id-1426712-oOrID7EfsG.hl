/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [neq] slot to check if the value of the node referenced by the expression `@.arguments/*/data` is not equal to an empty value. If the value is not equal to an empty string or null, the [neq] slot will return true. This can be useful for validating that a specific argument or data node is not empty before proceeding with further operations. 
 * 
 * 1. [neq] - Checks if the value of the referenced node is not equal to the specified value.
 * 2. [x:@.arguments/*/data] - Expression pointing to the node whose value is being compared.
 * 3. [.] - Represents an empty value for comparison.
