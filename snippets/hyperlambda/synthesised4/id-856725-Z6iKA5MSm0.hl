/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to modify the value of the [.type] node. It employs the [strings.replace-not-of] slot to replace any character in the [.type] node's value that is not found in the specified set of characters (a-z, 0-9, and underscore) with an underscore. This ensures that the [.type] node's value contains only valid characters from the given set. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.type] node.
 * 2. [strings.replace-not-of] - Replaces characters not in the specified set with an underscore.
 * 3. [.] - Specifies the set of allowed characters and the replacement character.
