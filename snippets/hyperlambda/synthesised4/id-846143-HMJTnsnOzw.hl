// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to append a node to a specified location in the Hyperlambda graph. The [add] slot targets the [allow] node and appends a new child node to it. This new node's value is dynamically set using an expression that references the [value] node. This operation effectively adds a new child to the [allow] node, with its value determined by the current value of the [value] node.
add:x:@.allow

      .:x:@.value
