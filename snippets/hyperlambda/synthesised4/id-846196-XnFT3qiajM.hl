/*
 * This Hyperlambda code evaluates a boolean logical condition using the [and] slot to ensure that both conditions are true. The first condition checks if the [result] node is not null using [not-null], and the second condition checks if the [result] node is not equal to an empty value using [neq]. If both conditions are true, the [and] slot will evaluate to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Combines multiple conditions and evaluates to true only if all conditions are true.
 * 2. [not-null] - Checks if the [result] node is not null.
 * 3. [neq] - Checks if the [result] node is not equal to an empty value.
