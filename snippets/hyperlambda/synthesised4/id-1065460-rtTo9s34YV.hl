/*
 * 1. `@.words`: This iterator starts by locating the first node named "words" in the current context. It uses the "@" symbol to search for a node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to target a specific node by its name within the current hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all the children nodes of the "words" node. It is used to access each child node under the "words" node, allowing you to perform operations or evaluations on each of these child nodes. This is particularly useful for iterating over a collection of nodes to apply some logic or retrieve their values.
