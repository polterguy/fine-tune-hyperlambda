// This Hyperlambda code uses the [and] slot to evaluate a series of boolean conditions. The outer [and] evaluates to true because its single child condition is true. The inner [and] evaluates to false because not all of its child conditions are true, demonstrating the short-circuiting behavior of [and] where evaluation stops once a false condition is encountered.
