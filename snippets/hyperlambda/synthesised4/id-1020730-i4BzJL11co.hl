/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator searches for the first node in the current context that has the name specified after the `@` symbol. In this case, it looks for the first node named "url". This is useful when you need to retrieve a specific node by its name from the current node's context or its ancestors.
 * 2. `.url` - This specifies the name of the node to be retrieved. It is used in conjunction with the `@` iterator to find a node named "url". This is particularly useful when you want to access or manipulate the value or children of a node with a known name within the current context or hierarchy.
