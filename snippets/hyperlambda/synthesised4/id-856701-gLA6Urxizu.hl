// This Hyperlambda code snippet converts the first element of a split string to lowercase and assigns it to a node named [.token]. It uses [strings.split] to break a string into parts and [strings.to-lower] to convert the first part to lowercase, which is then set as the value of [.token] using [set-value].
set-value:x:@.token
   strings.to-lower:x:@strings.split/0
