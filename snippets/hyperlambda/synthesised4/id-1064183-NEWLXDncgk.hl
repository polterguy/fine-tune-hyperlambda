/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for accessing a node that is expected to be present in the current execution context, such as when dealing with function arguments or parameters.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument or parameter that might be passed to a function or a slot.
 * 
 * 3. `[0,2]` - This iterator retrieves a subset of the previous result set, specifically the first two nodes. The first number (0) indicates the starting index, and the second number (2) indicates the number of nodes to retrieve. This is useful for accessing a specific range of nodes, such as the first two arguments in a list of parameters.
