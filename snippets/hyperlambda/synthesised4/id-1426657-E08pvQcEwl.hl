/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [strings.replace] slot in Hyperlambda to replace occurrences of a specific character in a string with another character. In this example, it replaces all carriage return characters ("\r") in the string located at [.anchor] with a space character (" "). 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.replace] - This slot is used to replace occurrences of a specified string within another string.
 * 2. [x:@.anchor] - This expression points to the node whose value will be modified by replacing characters.
 * 3. [.] - The first child node specifies the string to be replaced, which is the carriage return character ("\r") in this case.
 * 4. [.] - The second child node specifies the replacement string, which is a space character (" ").
