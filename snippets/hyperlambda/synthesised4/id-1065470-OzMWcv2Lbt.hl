// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" that is a direct sibling or ancestor of the current node. It is commonly used to reference a specific node by name within the current context, allowing you to retrieve or manipulate its value or children nodes. In this case, it is used to locate the "sql" node in the current hierarchy, which might contain SQL-related data or operations.
