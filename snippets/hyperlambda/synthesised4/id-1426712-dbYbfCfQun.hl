// This Hyperlambda code snippet concatenates a list of strings into one string. It uses the [strings.concat] slot to combine the values of nodes found at the expression [@.session/] and the value obtained from the [get-value] slot pointing to [@.fixed]. The result is a single concatenated string.
strings.concat
