// The [add] slot is used to dynamically add nodes into a specified destination node. In this example, the [add] slot targets all sibling nodes named [return] and adds a new unnamed node as a child to each [return] node. The additional level of indirection allows for evaluating slots before adding the resulting nodes to the destination.
