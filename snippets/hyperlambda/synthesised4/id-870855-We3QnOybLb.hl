// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot. It targets the [message] node within the [mail.smtp.send] structure, adding all child nodes of the [entity] node to it. This operation effectively merges the content of the [entity] node into the [message] node, allowing for dynamic message construction based on existing node structures.
add:x:../*/mail.smtp.send/*/message
   get-nodes:x:@.entity/*
