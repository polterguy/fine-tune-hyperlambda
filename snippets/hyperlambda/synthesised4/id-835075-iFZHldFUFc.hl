// The [whitelist] slot in Hyperlambda restricts the execution of a block of code to a specified set of slots, enhancing security by limiting the operations that can be performed. The [vocabulary] node lists the allowed slots, while the [.lambda] node contains the code to be executed within these constraints. This setup ensures that only the specified slots can be invoked, preventing unauthorized or potentially harmful operations.
