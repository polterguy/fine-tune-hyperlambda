// 1. `@.no`: This iterator searches for the first node named "no" that is an ancestor or a sibling of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it looks for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it starts the search from the current node's context. This is useful in scenarios where you need to access a specific node that might be located higher up in the hierarchy or among sibling nodes, such as retrieving a configuration setting or a control flag that affects the current node's processing logic.
