// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [execute] slot to invoke a function within the "magic.ai.functions.invoke" context. It passes several arguments to the function, including [type], [session], [user-id], [invocation], and [extra], each of which is evaluated from the current node graph using lambda expressions. The [invocation] argument is passed by reference, allowing the function to modify the original node. This setup is typically used to dynamically execute AI-related functions by providing necessary context and parameters.
