// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a string within another string. It takes a target string from the [.result] node and replaces occurrences of the string specified by the [url] node with the value of the [url] node. The [get-value] slot is used to retrieve the value of the [url] node for the replacement operation.
strings.replace:x:@.result
   .:[[url]]
   get-value:x:@.url
