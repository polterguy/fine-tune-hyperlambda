/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet uses logical operations to check if a specific node's value is not equal to a given value. It uses the [and] slot to ensure both conditions are true, and the [not] slot to negate the equality check. The [eq] slot checks for equality, and [get-value] retrieves the value of a node. The code checks if the value of the node located at [.dp/#/*/Default] is not equal to an empty value in two different ways, ensuring that both conditions must be true for the [and] slot to evaluate to true.
 * // 1. [and] - Ensures both child conditions must evaluate to true.
 * // 2. [not] - Negates the result of its child condition.
 * // 3. [eq] - Checks if the value of the specified node is equal to a given value.
 * // 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression.
