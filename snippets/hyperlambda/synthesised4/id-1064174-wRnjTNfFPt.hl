 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot, which are typically organized under an [.arguments] node.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each individual argument that has been passed to the function or slot.
 * 3. `group_column` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "group_column" among the children of the [.arguments] node. It is used to specifically access the argument named "group_column" if it exists.
