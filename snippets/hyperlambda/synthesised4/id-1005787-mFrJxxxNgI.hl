 * 1. `-`: This iterator retrieves the previous sibling of the current node. It is useful when you need to access or manipulate the node that is immediately above the current node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is commonly used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing you to perform operations on each child node.
