/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "hyper2lambda" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, checking each node's name until it finds a match. This is useful for locating a specific node in a potentially large and complex Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node found by the previous iterator. It allows you to access all direct descendants of the "hyper2lambda" node. This can be useful for operations that need to process or evaluate all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to gather or manipulate all child nodes of a specific "hyper2lambda" node, such as when transforming data structures or applying a batch operation to all children.
