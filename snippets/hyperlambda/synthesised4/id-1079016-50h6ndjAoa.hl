 * 1. `@http` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "http" within the current context. It is used to locate the node that represents HTTP-related operations or configurations. This is useful for accessing HTTP settings or operations defined in the current Hyperlambda graph.
 * 
 * 2. `post` - This iterator looks for a child node named "post" under the previously found "http" node. It is typically used to access or manipulate HTTP POST operations, such as sending data to a server or handling POST requests in an HTTP endpoint.
