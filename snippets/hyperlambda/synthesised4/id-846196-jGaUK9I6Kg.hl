// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to return a result from a previously executed signal, specifically retrieving the "cached" node's value. It also includes additional metadata about the return operation, such as the finish reason and whether the result should be streamed. The [return] slot is used to encapsulate the returned data, with [result] pointing to the cached value, [finish_reason] indicating the reason for completion, and [stream] specifying the streaming status.
