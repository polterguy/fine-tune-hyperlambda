// The code snippet demonstrates how to execute a workflow action named "markdown2html" using the [execute] slot. It specifies the filename of the action and passes in arguments, where the markdown content is dynamically retrieved and encoded from a specified path using an expression. This setup allows for converting markdown content to HTML within a workflow.
execute:magic.workflows.actions.execute
   name:markdown2html
   filename:/misc/workflows/actions/misc/markdown2html.hl
   arguments
      markdown:x:--/execute/=html-encode-body/*/content
