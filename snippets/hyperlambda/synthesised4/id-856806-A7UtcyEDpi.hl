// This code snippet demonstrates the use of the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node. The [set-value] slot targets the node referenced by its expression, in this case, [.first], and assigns it a new value, which is specified as a child node. Here, the value is set to a boolean false. This operation is useful for dynamically updating node values in Hyperlambda.
