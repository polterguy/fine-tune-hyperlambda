// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the value of all [h5] nodes that are children of the [page-header] node to the value of the [prompt] node. The [set-value] slot is used to modify the node values, and it takes the expression pointing to the nodes to be changed, while [get-value] retrieves the value from the [prompt] node to be set.
set-value:x:@.page-header/*/h5
   get-value:x:@.prompt
