/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is commonly used to access the root arguments node in a Hyperlambda file, which typically contains the input parameters for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `rtl` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `rtl`. It is used to specifically target the `rtl` argument among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression is useful when you need to access the value of a specific argument named `rtl` that is passed to a Hyperlambda function or endpoint. It allows you to directly retrieve the `rtl` argument from the list of input parameters, which can then be used in further processing within the Hyperlambda code.
