// The [return-nodes] slot is used to return a collection of nodes from a dynamically created slot or other contexts that explicitly allow returning nodes. In this example, it returns all nodes resulting from evaluating the expression [@data.read/*/*], effectively returning a subset of nodes from the [data.read] node's children.
