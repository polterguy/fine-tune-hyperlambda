// The code retrieves the value of a node by dynamically constructing an expression using the name of another node. It first evaluates [get-name] to obtain the name of a node, then uses this name to form a path expression that fetches the value of the corresponding child node under [.result]. This technique allows for flexible and dynamic retrieval of node values based on their names.
