/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the node hierarchy.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the parent node. It is used to access every child node under the current parent.
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the children nodes to only those named "signal". It is used to narrow down the node set to nodes specifically named "signal".
 * 4. `=` - This iterator retrieves nodes with a specific value. In this case, it looks for nodes with the value "magic.ai.crawl-site". It is used to find nodes that have a specific value, which is useful for identifying nodes with a particular purpose or identifier.
 * 5. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes that matched the previous criteria. It is used to further explore the hierarchy under the matched nodes.
 * 6. `.onafter` - This iterator filters the children nodes to only those named ".onafter". It is used to find nodes that are specifically named ".onafter", which might indicate a specific event or action that occurs after another.
 * 7. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the ".onafter" nodes. It is used to access every child node under the ".onafter" nodes.
 * 8. `.auto_destruct` - This iterator filters the children nodes to only those named ".auto_destruct". It is used to find nodes that are specifically named ".auto_destruct", which might indicate a self-destruct mechanism or cleanup action.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a web crawler or automation script to find and handle specific signals related to site crawling, particularly focusing on events that occur after a certain action and involve an automatic destruction or cleanup process.
 * - It could be used in a monitoring system to track and manage specific signals that trigger self-destruct actions, ensuring that resources are properly cleaned up after use.
