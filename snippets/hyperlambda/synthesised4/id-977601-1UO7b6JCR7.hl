// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [convert] slot to change the type of a value to a double. The [convert] slot takes an expression pointing to the node whose value is to be converted, and the [type] argument specifies the target type for conversion. If the conversion is successful, the node's value will be updated to the new type.
convert:x:-
   type:double
