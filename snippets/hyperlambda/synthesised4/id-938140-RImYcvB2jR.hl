// This Hyperlambda code creates a loop that continues executing as long as the value of [.time_left] is greater than zero. Inside the loop, it logs "Time remaining", sleeps for 1 second, and decrements the [.time_left] value by 1. The [while] slot ensures the loop persists until the condition is false, using [mt] to check if [.time_left] is more than zero, and [math.decrement] to reduce its value.
