// The Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to update records in a SQLite database table named "Employees" using the [data.update] slot. It specifies the database type as SQLite, the table to update, and includes a [values] node for the fields to be updated. The [where] node, combined with [and], is used to define the conditions for the update, ensuring only specific records are modified.
