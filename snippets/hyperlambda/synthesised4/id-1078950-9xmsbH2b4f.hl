/*
 * 1. `@.scan`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "scan" that is located at the same level or higher in the hierarchy relative to the current node. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds the node named "scan". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve a configuration or setting node named "scan" that might be defined at a higher level in the hierarchy, ensuring that the most relevant or closest "scan" node is accessed.
 * - It can be used in a scenario where multiple "scan" nodes exist at different levels, and the requirement is to use the one closest to the current context.
