/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".arguments" in the current context. It's used to access the arguments node, which is typically the starting point for accessing input parameters or configuration settings in a Hyperlambda execution context.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously retrieved ".arguments" node. It allows you to access all the arguments or parameters that are defined under the ".arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `/database-type`: This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to only include nodes with the name "database-type". It's used to specifically access the "database-type" argument, which might be used to determine the type of database being interacted with, such as SQL, NoSQL, etc. This is crucial for configuring database connections or executing database-specific logic.
