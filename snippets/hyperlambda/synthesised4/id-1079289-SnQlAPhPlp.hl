 * 1. `@.no`: This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "no" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name. The `.` before "no" specifies that the search is limited to the current level or context, rather than traversing through siblings or other levels in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve a specific node named "no" in the current context, which might be useful if you need to check its value or perform operations based on its presence or absence.
