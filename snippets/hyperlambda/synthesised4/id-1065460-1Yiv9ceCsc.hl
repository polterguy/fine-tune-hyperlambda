/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" in the current context, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. It is useful for accessing the arguments node in a Hyperlambda file or HTTP endpoint, which typically contains parameters passed to the slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node(s). In this context, it will retrieve all children of the "arguments" node. This is useful when you want to access all parameters or arguments passed to a slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `limit` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those with the name "limit". It is used to specifically access the "limit" parameter or argument within the "arguments" node. This is helpful when you need to work with or validate a specific parameter passed to a slot or endpoint.
