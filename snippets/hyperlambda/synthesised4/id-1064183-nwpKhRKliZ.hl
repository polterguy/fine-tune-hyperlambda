 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [arguments] that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It is often used to access the arguments passed into a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected [arguments] node. It is used to access all argument nodes passed into the function or slot.
 * 3. `offset` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to find the first node named [offset]. It is used to specifically access the [offset] argument among the arguments passed into the function or slot.
