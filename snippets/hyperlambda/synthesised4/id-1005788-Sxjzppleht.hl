/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors and siblings if necessary. The ".dp" node is often used in Hyperlambda to refer to the currently iterated node in a loop or a similar construct, such as within a [for-each] loop.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator. In Hyperlambda, the `#` symbol is used to access the value of a node when that value is itself a node, effectively allowing you to work with the node by reference rather than by value. This is particularly useful when you want to modify the original node or its children directly, rather than working with a copy of the node.
