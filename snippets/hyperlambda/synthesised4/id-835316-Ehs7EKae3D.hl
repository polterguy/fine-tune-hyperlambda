// The [validators.default] slot checks if a node named [stream] exists within the node collection specified by its expression. If the node doesn't exist, it appends it with a default value of "false". If the node exists but has a null value, it sets its value to "false". This ensures that the [stream] node always has a boolean value of "false" unless explicitly set otherwise.
