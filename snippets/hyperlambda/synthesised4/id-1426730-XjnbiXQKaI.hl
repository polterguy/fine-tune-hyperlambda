/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append a node to a specified location within a node graph. The [add] slot takes an expression pointing to a node collection and appends the specified nodes as children. In this example, the code appends a node with a value derived from an expression to the node set referenced by the expression in the [add] slot.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends a node to the node set specified by its expression.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the node to be added as a child to the node set.
 * 3. [.:x:@.value] - The value of the node to be added, derived from evaluating the expression pointing to [.value].
