// This Hyperlambda code throws an exception with the message "Access denied". It sets the HTTP status code to 401, indicating unauthorized access, and marks the exception as public, allowing it to propagate to the client even in release builds. The [throw] slot is used to handle error situations by generating exceptions that can be caught or returned to the client.
