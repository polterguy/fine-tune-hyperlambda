// The code snippet uses the [and] slot to evaluate multiple conditions, specifically checking if the name of a node is equal to the value of the [role] node within the [.arguments] node. The [and] slot ensures that all conditions must be true for the overall evaluation to return true. The [name.eq] slot compares the node's name to a specified value.
