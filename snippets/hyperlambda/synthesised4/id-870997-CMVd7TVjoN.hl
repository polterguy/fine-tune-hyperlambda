// This Hyperlambda code constructs a URL by concatenating various components such as the request scheme, host, and a static path, along with a dynamic file name retrieved from the arguments. The [set-value] slot assigns this concatenated URL to the [.url] node. The [strings.concat] slot is used to join these components into a single URL string.
