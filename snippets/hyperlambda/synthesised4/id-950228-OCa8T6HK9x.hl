// This Hyperlambda code uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.result] node. It employs the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a substring within the current [.result] value. The [get-value] slots are used to dynamically fetch the "what" and "with" values from the [.dp] node, which are used as the search and replacement strings, respectively. This allows for dynamic string replacement based on the current context.
