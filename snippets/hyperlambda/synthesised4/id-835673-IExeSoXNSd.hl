// The code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database table named "clients" using the [data.read] slot. It specifies the use of a distinct function for column selection, aliasing it as "count", and applies a [where] clause with an [and] condition for filtering results. The [database-type] is set to "sqlite", indicating the database type being used.
