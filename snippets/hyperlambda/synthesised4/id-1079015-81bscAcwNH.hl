/*
 * 1. `@http.get`: This iterator searches for the first node named `http.get` in the current context. It is used to locate the starting point of the expression, which is the `http.get` node. This is typically used to handle HTTP GET requests in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `http.get` node. It is used to access the children of the `http.get` node, which might contain various configurations or parameters related to the HTTP request.
 * 
 * 3. `content`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `content`. It is used to specifically target nodes that contain content-related data within the HTTP request or response structure.
 * 
 * 4. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `content` node. It is used to further explore the structure beneath the `content` node, potentially accessing detailed content data or sub-elements.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to extract specific content data from an HTTP GET request in a web application, allowing for processing or manipulation of the content.
 * - It might be used in an API integration scenario where the content of an HTTP response needs to be parsed and utilized in subsequent operations.
