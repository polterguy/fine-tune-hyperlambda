// The code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [neq] slot, which checks for inequality between two values. It uses a lambda expression to reference a node named [value] and compares its value against a static value provided as a child node. If the values are not equal, the [neq] slot evaluates to true. The [neq] slot is useful for conditional branching based on non-equality conditions.
