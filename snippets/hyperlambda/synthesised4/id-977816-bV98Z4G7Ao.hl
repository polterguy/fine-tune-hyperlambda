// This Hyperlambda code uses the [switch] slot to evaluate the value of the [.plan] node. It checks if the plan matches the [.expected] node or is "basic", logging a message accordingly. If neither case matches, the [default] case logs "Unknown plan". The [switch] slot allows for conditional execution based on the value of [.plan].
switch:x:@.plan
   case:x:@.expected
      log.info:User has the expected plan
   case:basic
      log.info:User is on a basic plan
   default
      log.info:Unknown plan
