/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a database transaction that involves inserting a new order and updating product stock. It connects to the "shopDB" database, creates a transaction, inserts a new record into the "orders" table with specified values, updates the "products" table to adjust the stock for a given product ID, and commits the transaction to finalize these changes. The transaction ensures that both operations are completed successfully together. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.connect] - Connects to the "shopDB" database.
 * 2. [data.transaction.create] - Initiates a new database transaction.
 * 3. [data.create] - Inserts a new record into the "orders" table.
 * 4. [values] - Specifies the values for the new order, including "customer_id" and "total".
 * 5. [data.update] - Updates the "products" table to modify the stock.
 * 6. [values] - Sets the new stock value for the specified product.
 * 7. [where] - Specifies the condition to identify the product to update.
 * 8. [data.transaction.commit] - Commits the transaction to save the changes.
