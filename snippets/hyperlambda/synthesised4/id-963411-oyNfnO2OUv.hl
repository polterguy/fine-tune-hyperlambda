 * // This Hyperlambda code deletes a record from the "users" table in a PostgreSQL database.
 * // The [pgsql.delete] slot specifies the table and the [where] clause defines the condition for deletion.
 * // 1. [pgsql.delete] - Initiates the deletion process from the specified table.
 * // 2. [table] - Specifies the table "users" from which the record will be deleted.
 * // 3. [where] - Begins the condition block for the deletion criteria.
 * // 4. [and] - Logical operator to combine multiple conditions, though here it's used for a single condition.
 * // 5. [id.eq] - Specifies the condition where the "id" field must equal 1001, determining which record to delete.
