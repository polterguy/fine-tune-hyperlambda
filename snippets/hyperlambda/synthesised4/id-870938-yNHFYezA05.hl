// This Hyperlambda code snippet updates the value of nodes within a specific path. It uses [set-value] to change the value of nodes located at the path [@.invocation/*/execute/*/name] to the value retrieved by [get-value] from the path [@.arguments/*/args/*/action_name]. This effectively synchronizes the node values in the specified paths.
