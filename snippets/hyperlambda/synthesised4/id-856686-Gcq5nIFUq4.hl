// This Hyperlambda code compares the issuer of a token from a data point with the issuer obtained from the token verification process. The [eq] slot checks if the issuer from the [.dp] node matches the issuer from the [auth.token.verify] node. If both issuers are the same, the [eq] slot evaluates to true. The [get-value] slot retrieves the issuer value from the token verification node for comparison.
