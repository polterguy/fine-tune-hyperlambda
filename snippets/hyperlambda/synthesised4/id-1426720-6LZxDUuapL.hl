// This Hyperlambda code performs a comparison to check if the status code of an HTTP POST request, referenced by the expression `@http.post`, is less than 300. If the status code is indeed less than 300, it indicates a successful HTTP response, as status codes below 300 generally represent successful HTTP operations. The [lt] slot is used for this less-than comparison, and the result of this operation can be used for further conditional logic in the Hyperlambda script.
