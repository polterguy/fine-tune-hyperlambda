// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [mte] slot to compare the age of a user against the value 18. It checks if the user's age is "more than or equal" to 18, which can be useful for validating age-related conditions, such as verifying if a user is an adult. The [mte] slot takes two arguments: the first retrieves the user's age, and the second is the integer value 18.
