// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [remove-nodes] slot to remove nodes. The expression [remove-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/direction] targets and removes all nodes named "direction" that are children of the [.arguments] node. This is useful for dynamically modifying the node structure by eliminating specific nodes based on their names.
