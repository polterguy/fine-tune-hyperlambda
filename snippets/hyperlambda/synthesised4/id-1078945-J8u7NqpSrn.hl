/*
 * 1. `@.exe`: This iterator searches for the first node named "exe" that is a sibling or ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node's position in the hierarchy and moves upwards or sideways in the tree structure to find the node named "exe". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve configuration or execution parameters stored in a node named "exe" that might be defined at a higher level in the hierarchy.
 * - It can also be used to access a specific node that contains executable code or instructions, which might be needed for further processing or evaluation.
