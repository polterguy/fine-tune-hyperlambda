// This Hyperlambda code sets an HTTP response header to control caching behavior. The [response.headers.set] slot is used to specify the "Cache-Control" header with a value of "public, max-age=300", indicating that the response can be cached by any cache and should be considered fresh for 300 seconds. This is useful for optimizing web performance by allowing clients and proxies to cache responses for a specified duration.
