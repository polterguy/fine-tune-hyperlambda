/*
 * 1. `@.iterations`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "iterations" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings but looks for the node in the current node's ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a node that is defined earlier in the hierarchy, such as a configuration or a counter that is used in a loop or repeated process.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a loop counter or iteration limit that is defined at a higher level in the hierarchy.
 * - Retrieving configuration settings or parameters that are specified earlier in the code structure.
