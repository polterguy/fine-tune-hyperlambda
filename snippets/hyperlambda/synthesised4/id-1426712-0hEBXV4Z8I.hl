/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code uses the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions, both of which check if the string value of the [.result] node contains specific substrings. The first condition checks for the presence of the substring "___", and the second condition checks for the presence of the substring "FUNCTION_INVOCATION[". The [and] slot ensures that both conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. If both substrings are found within the [.result] node's value, the [and] slot will return true; otherwise, it will return false. This code is useful for validating that a string contains multiple required patterns or markers. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Evaluates multiple conditions and returns true only if all conditions are true.
 * 2. [strings.contains] - Checks if the [.result] node contains the substring "___".
 * 3. [strings.contains] - Checks if the [.result] node contains the substring "FUNCTION_INVOCATION[".
