/*
 * 1. `@.fields`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "fields" starting from the current node and traversing upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first "fields" node it encounters.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all the children nodes of the previously found "fields" node. It allows you to access each child node directly under "fields". 
 * 
 * This expression is useful for accessing and manipulating data within a specific section of a Hyperlambda graph, particularly when you need to work with all the child nodes of a "fields" node.
