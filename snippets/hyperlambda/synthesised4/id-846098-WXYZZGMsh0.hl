// This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specified substring within a string. It targets the string located at [.result], replacing all instances of the substring [[search]] with the string "false". The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the substring to search for, and the second is the replacement string.
strings.replace:x:@.result
   .:[[search]]
   .:false
