// This code snippet uses the [add] slot to append nodes returned by the [get-nodes] slot to a specific location in the node hierarchy. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves all nodes from the [data.read] path, and these nodes are then added as children to the [return] node in the current context. The [add] slot facilitates the inclusion of these nodes into the desired location, effectively merging the retrieved data into the existing node structure.
