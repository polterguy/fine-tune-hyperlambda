// This Hyperlambda code snippet is part of a conditional branching structure, specifically an [else] block. It sets the value of a node named [connection] by concatenating a string "[generic|" with the value of a [database] node found within [.arguments], and appending a closing bracket "]". This operation is performed only if all preceding conditional checks in the branching structure evaluate to false.
