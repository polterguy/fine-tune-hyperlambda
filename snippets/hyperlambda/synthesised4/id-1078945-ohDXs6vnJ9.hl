/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "new-prompt" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, checking each node's name. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that may not be a direct child of the current node but exists somewhere above it in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or metadata nodes that are defined at a higher level in the hierarchy.
 * - Retrieving a node that serves as a template or default value for operations performed at a lower level in the hierarchy.
