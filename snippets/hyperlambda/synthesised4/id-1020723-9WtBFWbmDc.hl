/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node(s) of the current node. It is used to navigate upwards in the node hierarchy to access parent nodes. In this context, it helps to move from the current node to its parent node(s).
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all direct child nodes of a given node. Here, it is used to access all children of the parent node retrieved by the previous iterator.
 * 
 * 3. `data.delete` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "data.delete" from the previous result set. It is used to filter out nodes that do not have the specified name. In this context, it selects nodes named "data.delete" among the children of the parent node.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It accesses all direct child nodes of the "data.delete" nodes retrieved by the previous iterator.
 * 
 * 5. `where` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "where" from the previous result set. It filters out nodes that do not have the specified name. Here, it selects nodes named "where" among the children of the "data.delete" nodes.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It accesses all direct child nodes of the "where" nodes retrieved by the previous iterator.
 * 
 * 7. `and` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name "and" from the previous result set. It filters out nodes that do not have the specified name. In this context, it selects nodes named "and" among the children of the "where" nodes.
