/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet modifies the value of the [.type] node by replacing every character not found in the specified set (lowercase letters, underscore, and digits) with an underscore. This is useful for sanitizing a string to ensure it only contains allowed characters. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.type] node.
 * 2. [strings.replace-not-of] - Replaces characters not in the specified set with an underscore.
 * 3. [.] - Specifies the allowed characters (lowercase letters, underscore, and digits). 
 * 4. [.] - Specifies the replacement character (underscore).
