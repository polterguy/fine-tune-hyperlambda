/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specific location within a node structure. It targets the [where] node inside a [data.read] path and appends nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot. The [get-nodes] slot fetches all nodes under the [.arguments] node, effectively transferring them to the specified location. This operation is useful for dynamically constructing query criteria based on input arguments.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to a specified location in the node structure.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node to be added.
