/*
 * 1. `@.matrix`: This iterator looks for the first ancestor node with the name "matrix". It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node named "matrix". This is useful for referencing a specific part of the node structure that might be repeated or nested within other nodes.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "matrix" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "matrix" node, regardless of their names. This is helpful when you want to perform operations on or evaluate multiple nodes under a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `candidate2`: This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "candidate2" among the children of the "matrix" node. It is used to pinpoint specific nodes of interest within a broader set of nodes, allowing for targeted operations or evaluations on those nodes.
