// This Hyperlambda code connects to the "master" database using the [mssql.connect] slot and executes a batch of SQL statements loaded from a file. The [mssql.execute-batch] slot is used to execute the SQL commands, which are retrieved using the [io.file.load] slot. The [case] slot wraps the entire operation, allowing for conditional execution or branching based on the case logic.
