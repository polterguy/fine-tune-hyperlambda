/*
 * 1. `@.rhs`: This iterator searches for the first node named "rhs" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `#`: This iterator retrieves the value of the node found by the previous iterator as a node by reference. This assumes that the value of the node is itself a node, allowing you to work directly with the original node rather than a copy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access and manipulate the value of a node named "rhs" directly, such as when performing operations on complex data structures where the node's value is another node or a graph of nodes.
