// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to perform an addition operation on nodes. It retrieves nodes using [get-nodes] from [.arguments] with names [prompt] and [session] and adds their values to the node referenced by [add]. The [add] slot aggregates the values of the specified nodes, allowing for dynamic data manipulation within the node graph structure.
