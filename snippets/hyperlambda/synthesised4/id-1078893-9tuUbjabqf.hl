/*
 * 1. `@slots.vocabulary` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "slots.vocabulary" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards through its ancestors and siblings until it finds a match. This is useful when you want to retrieve a specific node that might be located anywhere in the hierarchy above the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node found by the previous iterator. It allows you to access all direct descendants of the "slots.vocabulary" node. This can be useful for iterating over or processing all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to gather all vocabulary-related slots or definitions under a "slots.vocabulary" node, which might be part of a larger structure defining various slots or functionalities within a Hyperlambda application.
