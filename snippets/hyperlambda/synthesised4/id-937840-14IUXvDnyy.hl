// This Hyperlambda code executes a SQL query on an SQLite database to count the number of entries in the "crawl_urls" table. It uses the [data.read] slot to specify the database type and table, and includes a [columns] section to define the SQL column operation "count(*) as count". The [where] clause is present but not detailed, and a [limit] of 1 is set to restrict the result set to a single record.
