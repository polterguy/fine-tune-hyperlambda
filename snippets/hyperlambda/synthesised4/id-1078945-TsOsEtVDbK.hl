/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by finding the first node named `.arguments` in the current hierarchy. It's a common way to access the arguments node in Hyperlambda, especially when dealing with HTTP endpoints or dynamic slots that require input parameters.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It allows you to access any parameter or argument passed into the current context.
 * 
 * 3. `data`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `data` among the children of `.arguments`. It is used to specifically target a node named `data`, which might contain specific information or a dataset that the current operation needs to process.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in an HTTP endpoint to retrieve a specific data payload passed as an argument to the endpoint.
 * - It might be used in a dynamic slot to access a dataset or configuration parameter that is required for the slot's logic.
