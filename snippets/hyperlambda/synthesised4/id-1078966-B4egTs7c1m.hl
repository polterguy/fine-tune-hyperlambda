/*
 * 1. `@.html`: This iterator searches for the first node named "html" within the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy to find the first occurrence of a node with the name "html". This is useful when you need to access or manipulate the "html" node's value or its children nodes in a Hyperlambda structure, especially in scenarios where the "html" node might be a part of a larger document or template structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving the content of an HTML node in a document structure to perform operations like rendering or transformation.
 * - Accessing the "html" node to append or modify its children, such as adding new elements or attributes.
