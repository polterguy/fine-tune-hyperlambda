/*
 * 1. `@.session` - This iterator searches for the first node named "session" within the current context. It looks for a direct sibling or a node at the same level as the current node that matches the name "session". This is useful when you want to access session-specific data or variables that are stored in a node named "session".
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "session" node. It is used to access all the data or variables stored within the session node. This can be particularly useful for iterating over session attributes or values to perform operations like validation, logging, or data manipulation.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - Accessing all session variables to log them for debugging purposes.
 * - Iterating over session data to validate user permissions or roles.
 * - Collecting session attributes to prepare them for storage or transmission.
