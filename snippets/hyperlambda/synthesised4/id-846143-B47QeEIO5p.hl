// This Hyperlambda code splits a string using a colon (":") as a delimiter, then joins the resulting segments from the second element onwards, using a colon as a separator, and sets this as the value of the node referenced by [.value]. The [set-value] slot updates the node's value, [strings.split] divides the string, and [strings.join] concatenates the segments.
