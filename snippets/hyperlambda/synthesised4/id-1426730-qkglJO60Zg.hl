// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the node referenced by the expression `@.crawl-delay` to the integer value `60000`. The [set-value] slot is used to change the value of the specified node, which in this context represents a delay or timeout setting, possibly for a web crawler or similar functionality. The integer `60000` might represent milliseconds, implying a delay of 60 seconds.
