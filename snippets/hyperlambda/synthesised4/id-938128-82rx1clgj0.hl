// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the node referenced by its expression [@.accessLevel] to the static value "No access". The [set-value] slot is used to modify the value of nodes in the graph, and in this case, it ensures that the [accessLevel] node's value is updated to indicate no access rights.
