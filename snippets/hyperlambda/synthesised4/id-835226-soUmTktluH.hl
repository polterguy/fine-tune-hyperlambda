// The [crypto.random] slot generates a cryptographically secure random string with a specified length. In this example, the slot is configured to produce a string exactly 20 characters long, consisting of alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9). This is useful for creating secure tokens or passwords. The [min] and [max] arguments define the length of the generated string, and since both are set to 20, the output will always be 20 characters.
