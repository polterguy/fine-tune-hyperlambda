// This Hyperlambda code calculates the maximum number of tokens that can be used in a request to an OpenAI model by dividing the difference between a specified maximum token limit (8000) and the model's maximum tokens by 2. It then sets the calculated value as both the maximum context tokens and maximum request tokens for the model. The code uses [math.subtract] to compute the difference and [math.divide] to perform the division. The results are stored in the model's [max_context_tokens] and [max_request_tokens] nodes.
