/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node with this specific name, and it will return the first match it finds. This is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or an HTTP endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the `.arguments` node found in the previous step. It is used to access all nodes directly under `.arguments`, which could represent individual arguments or parameters.
 * 
 * 3. `args` - This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to only include nodes named `args`. It narrows down the selection to nodes specifically named `args` among the children of `.arguments`.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Similar to the previous `*`, this iterator retrieves all children of the `args` node. This step is used to access all nodes directly under `args`, which could represent specific elements or data structures within the `args` node.
 * 
 * 5. `table1` - This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to only include nodes named `table1`. It narrows down the selection to nodes specifically named `table1` among the children of `args`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to access a specific data table or dataset named `table1` that is passed as part of the arguments to a function or endpoint. It allows for precise retrieval of structured data within a larger set of input parameters.
 * - It might be used in scenarios where multiple tables or datasets are passed as arguments, and there is a need to specifically work with or manipulate the data within `table1`.
