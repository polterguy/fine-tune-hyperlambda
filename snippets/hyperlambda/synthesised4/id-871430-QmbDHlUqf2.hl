// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL SELECT operation on a SQLite database table named "clients" using the [data.read] slot. It specifies the retrieval of distinct values from a column named "distinct_functor" and aliases the result to a default name. The [where] clause is included with an [and] condition, although no specific conditions are defined within it.
