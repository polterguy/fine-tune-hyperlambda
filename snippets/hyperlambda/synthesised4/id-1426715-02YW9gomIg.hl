/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement with [case] and [default] slots to handle different scenarios based on the value of a [status] node. The [switch] statement evaluates the value of the [status] node, and executes the corresponding [case] block if a match is found. If no match is found, the [default] block is executed. This structure allows for clean and organized handling of multiple conditions based on a single value.
 * 
 * 1. [status] - Node representing the status to be evaluated in the switch statement.
 * 2. [switch] - Slot that evaluates the value of the [status] node and determines which [case] or [default] block to execute.
 * 3. [case] - Slot representing a specific condition to be matched against the [status] node's value.
 * 4. [default] - Slot executed if none of the [case] conditions match the [status] node's value.
