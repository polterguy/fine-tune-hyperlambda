// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [max] exists within the [.arguments] node and ensures it is not null. It uses the [and] slot to combine two conditions: [exists] verifies the presence of the [max] node, and [not-null] ensures that the [max] node has a non-null value. If both conditions are true, the [and] slot will evaluate to true.
