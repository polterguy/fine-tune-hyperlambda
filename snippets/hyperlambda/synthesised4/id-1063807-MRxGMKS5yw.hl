// 1. `@.migration-script-folder`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "migration-script-folder" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It will return the first match it finds. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located higher up in the hierarchy relative to the current node, ensuring you can retrieve configuration or data nodes that are not direct children of the current node.
