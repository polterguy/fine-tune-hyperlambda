// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each child node of [.values] using [for-each]. For each node, it checks if its value is more than or equal to 10 using [mte]. If the condition is true, it increments the value of [.count] using [math.increment]. The code effectively counts how many nodes in [.values] have a value of 10 or more.
