/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to navigate to the top level of the node hierarchy from any point within the structure. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate nodes at the root level, regardless of the current depth in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it is used to access all the children nodes of the root node. This is helpful when you want to perform operations or evaluations on every child node under the root.
 * 
 * 3. `return` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "return". It is used to specifically target nodes named "return" among the children of the root node. This is useful when you want to focus on nodes that are intended to return values or results in the Hyperlambda execution.
