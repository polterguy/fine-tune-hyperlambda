/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It is used to move downwards in the Hyperlambda structure to the next node at the same level.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current result set. After moving to the elder sibling, it collects all its child nodes.
 * 3. `*` - This iterator again retrieves all children nodes of the current result set. It is used to go one level deeper and collect all descendants of the previously retrieved children nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to traverse a Hyperlambda structure to gather all descendant nodes of the elder sibling of a given node. This might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze data that is hierarchically organized, such as configuration settings or nested data structures.
