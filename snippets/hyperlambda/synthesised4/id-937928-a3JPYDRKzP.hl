// The code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.result] node to "Yup!". The [set-value] slot takes an expression pointing to the node(s) whose value you want to change, and a source node that provides the new value. In this case, the [.result] node is updated with the static string "Yup!".
set-value:x:@.result
   .:Yup!
