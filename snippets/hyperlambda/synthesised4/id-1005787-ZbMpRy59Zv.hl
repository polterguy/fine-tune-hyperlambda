/*
 * 1. `@.dp`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and ".dp" specifies the exact name it is looking for. This is useful for accessing a specific node that might be used as a reference or a placeholder for data processing.
 * 
 * 2. `#`: This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is another node itself and retrieves this node by reference. This allows you to directly manipulate or access the node that is stored as the value of ".dp", rather than just getting a copy of it. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to modify or interact with the original node structure, such as updating values or traversing further into the node's children.
