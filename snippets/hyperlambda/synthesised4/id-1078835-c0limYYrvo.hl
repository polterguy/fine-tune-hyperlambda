/*
 * 1. `@request` - This iterator looks for the first node named "request" in the current context. It starts the search from the current position in the node hierarchy and moves upwards if necessary.
 * 2. `host` - This iterator filters the result set to find a child node named "host" under the previously found "request" node.
 * 
 * This expression is used to retrieve the value of the "host" node that is a child of the "request" node. This is typically used in web applications to get the host name or IP address of the incoming HTTP request, which can be useful for logging, access control, or generating dynamic content based on the host.
