// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL read operation using a left join on two tables, "notes" and "clients", in a SQLite database. The [data.read] slot specifies the database type as SQLite and the main table as "notes". A left join is performed with the "clients" table, using the "client_id" as an alias, and the join condition is specified to match the "client_id" from both tables. The [columns] slot specifies an aggregate function to be used, with its result aliased as "result". The [where] slot is included but not detailed, indicating conditions can be added for filtering. The [group] slot specifies a column for grouping the results. Finally, the [return-nodes] slot returns the nodes from the [data.read] operation. This setup is useful for retrieving grouped and aggregated data from joined tables in a SQLite database.
