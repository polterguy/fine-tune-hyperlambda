// This Hyperlambda code checks if a condition is true using the [if] slot and creates a new entry in the "ml_blocked_ips" table with the IP address and user ID if the condition is met. It logs the request headers and a message indicating the IP address was blocked using [log.info]. Finally, it throws an exception with a public message and a status code of 401 using the [throw] slot, indicating the user is permanently blocked from accessing the AI chatbot.
