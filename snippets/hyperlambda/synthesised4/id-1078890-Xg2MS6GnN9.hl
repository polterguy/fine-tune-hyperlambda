/*
 * 1. `@html2lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "html2lambda" in the current context. It starts the search from the root of the current node set and moves downwards in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "html2lambda" node. It does not filter by name, so it includes all direct children.
 * 
 * 3. `html` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those with the name "html". It assumes that one of the children of "html2lambda" is named "html".
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "html" node. Again, it does not filter by name, so it includes all direct children.
 * 
 * 5. `body` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those with the name "body". It assumes that one of the children of "html" is named "body".
 * 
 * 6. `**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the "body" node, including the "body" node itself. It uses a "breadth first" algorithm to traverse the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 7. `main` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those with the name "main". It assumes that there is a "main" node somewhere within the descendants of "body".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to extract the "main" content section from an HTML document that has been converted into a Hyperlambda node structure. It would be useful in scenarios where you need to specifically target and manipulate the main content of a webpage, such as for web scraping or data extraction purposes.
 * - Another use case could be in a web application where you want to dynamically modify or analyze the main section of a webpage's HTML structure, perhaps for customization or content management purposes.
