// The [auth.ticket.verify] slot checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to the specified role, "root" in this case. If the user does not belong to the "root" role, the slot will throw an exception, ensuring that only users with the appropriate role can proceed. This is typically used in contexts where role-based access control is needed, such as securing HTTP endpoints.
