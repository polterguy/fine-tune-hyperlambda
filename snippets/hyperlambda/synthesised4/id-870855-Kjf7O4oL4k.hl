// This Hyperlambda code uses the [and] slot to check two conditions: first, it uses [exists] to verify if a node named [name] exists within the [.arguments] node, and second, it uses [neq] to ensure that the value of the [name] node is not null or empty. If both conditions are true, the [and] slot evaluates to true.
