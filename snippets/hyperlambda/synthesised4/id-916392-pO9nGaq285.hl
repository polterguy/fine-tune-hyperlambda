// This Hyperlambda code uses logical conditions to evaluate the result of an HTTP POST request. It checks if the HTTP status code is less than 300 using [lt] and more than or equal to 200 using [mte], ensuring the response is a successful HTTP status code. The [and] slot combines these conditions, returning true only if both are satisfied.
