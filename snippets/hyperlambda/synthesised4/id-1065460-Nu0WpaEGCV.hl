// 1. `@.no` - This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which means it will look for the first node with the name "no" within the current context. The `.` following the `@` indicates that it will start the search from the current node's parent. This is useful when you want to access a sibling node or a node at the same level as the current node, specifically one named "no". This type of iterator is often used to retrieve specific nodes by name when their position relative to the current node is known.
