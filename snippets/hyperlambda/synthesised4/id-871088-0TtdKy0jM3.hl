// This Hyperlambda code snippet creates a loop that continues as long as two conditions are met: the existence of a node at the specified path and the token count of a JSON node exceeding a maximum limit. Within the loop, it removes a specific node and updates a JSON node with a new value derived from a lambda-to-JSON conversion. The [while] slot ensures the loop continues while conditions are true, [and] combines the conditions, [exists] checks for node existence, [mt] compares token counts, [remove-nodes] deletes a node, and [set-value] updates the JSON node.
