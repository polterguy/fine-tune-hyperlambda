/*
 * 1. `@csv2lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "csv2lambda" from the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further traversal within the node structure. This is useful when you want to begin processing or extracting data from a specific node named "csv2lambda".
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "csv2lambda" node. It is used to access each child node directly under the "csv2lambda" node. This is helpful when you need to process or analyze each child node of "csv2lambda", such as iterating over data rows if "csv2lambda" represents a CSV file converted into a node structure.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a CSV file that has been converted into a Hyperlambda node structure, and you want to access and process each row (represented as child nodes) of the CSV data.
