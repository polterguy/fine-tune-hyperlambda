/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if the number of child nodes under the [urls] node is less than 10,000. It uses the [get-count] slot to retrieve the number of child nodes and the [lt] slot to compare this count against the integer 10,000. If the count is less than 10,000, the condition evaluates to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [lt] - Compares two values and returns true if the first value is less than the second.
 * 2. [get-count] - Retrieves the number of child nodes under the [urls] node.
 * 3. [urls] - The node whose children are being counted.
 * 4. [int:10000] - The integer value against which the count is compared.
