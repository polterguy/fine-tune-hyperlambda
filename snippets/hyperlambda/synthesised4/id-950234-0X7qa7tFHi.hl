// The code snippet demonstrates a conditional check using the [if] slot in Hyperlambda. It evaluates an [and] condition to determine if both [.s1] and [.s2] are true. If both conditions are met, the [set-value] slot is used to assign the value "OK" to the [.res] node. This logic is encapsulated within a [.lambda] node, which is executed only if the [and] condition evaluates to true.
