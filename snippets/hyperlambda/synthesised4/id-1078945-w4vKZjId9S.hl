/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] from the current context. It is used to access the arguments node, which is typically the starting point for processing input parameters in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument passed into the current context, allowing for iteration or further processing of these arguments.
 * 
 * 3. `type` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "type". It is used to specifically access the "type" nodes within the children of the [.arguments] node, which might represent the data type of each argument.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda script to validate or process input arguments based on their data types. For example, it might be part of a validation routine that ensures all arguments are of the expected type before proceeding with further logic.
