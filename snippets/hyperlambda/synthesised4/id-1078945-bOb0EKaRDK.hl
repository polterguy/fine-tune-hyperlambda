 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node named "new-prompt" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that the search is limited to the current node's siblings and itself, but not its children. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to quickly access or manipulate a node named "new-prompt" that exists at the same hierarchical level as the current node, which can be useful in scenarios where you need to retrieve or update specific data without traversing deeper into a node structure.
