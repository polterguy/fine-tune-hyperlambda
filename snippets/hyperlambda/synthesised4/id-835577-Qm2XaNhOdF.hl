// The code demonstrates how to select data from a SQLite database using the [data.read] slot. It specifies the database type as SQLite and targets the "Customers" table. The [columns] node includes an aggregate function, with its result aliased as "result". The [where] node is present but not detailed, indicating conditions can be added. The [limit] is set to 1, ensuring only one record is returned. This setup is useful for retrieving a single aggregated result from the database.
