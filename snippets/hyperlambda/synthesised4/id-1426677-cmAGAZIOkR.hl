/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to determine the type of a node's value. The [type] slot returns the Hyperlambda type name of a specified value. In the given example, a node [.foo] is declared with an integer value of 57. The [type] slot is then used to retrieve the type of the node's value, which in this case would be "int". This functionality is useful for dynamically checking or verifying the data types of values within a Hyperlambda script.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo:int:57] - Declares a node named [.foo] with an integer value of 57.
 * 2. [type:x:-] - Retrieves the type of the value of the previous node, which is "int" in this case.
