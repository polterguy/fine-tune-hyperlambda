 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet pauses the execution of the current thread for 10 milliseconds. The [sleep] slot is used to introduce a delay in the execution flow, which can be useful in scenarios where you need to wait for a short period before continuing with the next operations. The sleep operation is non-blocking, meaning it releases the thread back to the operating system, allowing other processes to use the CPU resources during the sleep period.
 * // [sleep] - Pauses the current thread for a specified number of milliseconds, in this case, 10 milliseconds.
