// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name. The `.` before `sql` means it will look for this node starting from the current node's parent, effectively searching for a sibling node named "sql". This is useful when you want to reference a specific sibling node in your Hyperlambda code, such as when you need to retrieve or manipulate data related to SQL operations stored in a sibling node.
