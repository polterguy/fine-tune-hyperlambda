/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes to a destination node's children collection. It takes the nodes from the result of the [get-nodes] slot, which retrieves nodes from the [.allow] node's children, and appends them to the children of the node referenced by the expression in the [add] slot. This allows for dynamic modification of the node structure by adding new nodes to a specified location. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the destination node's children collection.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.allow] node's children.
