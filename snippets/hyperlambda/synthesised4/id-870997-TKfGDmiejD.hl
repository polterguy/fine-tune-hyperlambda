// The code checks if a folder at the specified path does not exist using [io.folder.exists]. If the folder is absent, it creates the folder using [io.folder.create]. This ensures the folder is present for subsequent operations. The [not] slot inverts the condition from [io.folder.exists], triggering the folder creation only when the folder is missing.
