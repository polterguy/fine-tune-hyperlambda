// This Hyperlambda code checks if the name of the first child node of [hyper2lambda] is equal to "..". If the condition is true, it sets the value of [.desc] to the value of the first child node of [hyper2lambda]. The [if] slot evaluates the condition using [eq] and executes the [.lambda] block if the condition holds true.
