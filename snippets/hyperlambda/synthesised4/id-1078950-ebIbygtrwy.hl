/*
 * 1. `@.scan` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "scan" that is an ancestor or a sibling of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings, until it finds a node named "scan". This is useful for accessing a specific node that might be located at a higher level in the hierarchy or among siblings, without needing to know the exact path.
 * 
 * 2. `0` - This iterator retrieves the first child of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the "scan" node has children and selects the first one. This can be useful when you want to access a specific child node of a known parent node, especially when the order of children is significant.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access the first child of a "scan" node, which might contain important data or configuration settings that need to be processed or evaluated further.
