// This Hyperlambda code checks if the name of the first child node of [hyper2lambda] is equal to "..". If the condition is true, it inserts a new node with [.arguments] as a child node immediately after the first child node of [hyper2lambda]. The [if] slot evaluates the condition, and if true, the [.lambda] block is executed to modify the node structure.
