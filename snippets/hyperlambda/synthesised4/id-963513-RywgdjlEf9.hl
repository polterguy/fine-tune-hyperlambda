// This Hyperlambda code checks if either the value of [metricX] is less than 6 or the value of [metricY] is more than 14. If either condition is true, it sets the [status] node's value to true. The [or] slot allows for logical OR operations between the two conditions, and the [if] slot evaluates the conditions, executing its lambda object if true.
