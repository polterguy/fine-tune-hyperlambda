// This Hyperlambda code snippet modifies the value of the [.result] node by replacing occurrences of a placeholder string "[[button]]" with a value derived from the [.arguments] node. The [strings.replace] slot is used to perform the string replacement, where the placeholder "[[button]]" is replaced by the first non-null value obtained from either the [button] argument or a default value. The [get-first-value] slot ensures that only the first available value is used for the replacement.
