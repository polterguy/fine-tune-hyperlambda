// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append child nodes to a specific node referenced by its expression. The [add] slot targets the node obtained by de-referencing the [.dp] node's value, and adds two new nodes: [tokens] with an integer value of 128000, and [chat] with a boolean value of true. This operation dynamically modifies the node structure by adding specified nodes to the targeted node.
