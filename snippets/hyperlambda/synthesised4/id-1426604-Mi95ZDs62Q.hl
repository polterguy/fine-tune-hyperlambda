/*
 * This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of a node located at a specific path. It starts by referencing the [.dp] node, de-references its value, and then navigates through its children nodes to find the node named [path], returning its value. This is useful for accessing deeply nested node values within a graph structure.
 * 
 * 1. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression.
 * 2. [x:@.dp/#/*/path] - The expression that navigates through the node structure to locate the desired node.
