// This Hyperlambda code snippet converts the value of the node located at the expression [@.arguments/*/max_function_invocations] to an integer type using the [convert] slot. The [convert] slot takes an expression pointing to the node whose value needs conversion and a [type] argument specifying the target type, which in this case is "int". If the conversion is not possible, an exception will be thrown.
convert:x:@.arguments/*/max_function_invocations
   type:int
