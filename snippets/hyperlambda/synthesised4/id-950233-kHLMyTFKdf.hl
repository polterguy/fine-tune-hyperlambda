// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [temperature] node is greater than 30. If the condition is true, it sets the value of the [weather-status] node to "hot". The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, and the [mt] slot performs a "more than" comparison. The [set-value] slot assigns the value "hot" to the [weather-status] node when the condition is met.
