/*
 * 1. `@.body`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "body" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches for the node within the same level or among its ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node, particularly when dealing with structured data where "body" might represent a section or content block.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to extract or manipulate the content of a "body" node within a document or message structure, such as processing the main content of an email or a web page.
