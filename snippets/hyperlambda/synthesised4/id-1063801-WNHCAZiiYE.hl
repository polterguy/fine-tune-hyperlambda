/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing the arguments passed to a function or a slot, especially in dynamic slots or endpoint definitions where arguments are typically encapsulated within an "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node set. In this context, it retrieves all children of the "arguments" node. This is useful for iterating over or accessing all arguments passed to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `query` - This iterator filters the previously selected node set to only include nodes named "query". It is used to specifically access the "query" argument from the list of all arguments, assuming such an argument exists.
