/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator looks for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It's typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint in Hyperlambda. This is crucial in scenarios where you need to validate or manipulate input data.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access the individual argument nodes that are children of the `.arguments` node, allowing you to perform operations on each argument.
 * 
 * 3. `message`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name `message`. It is used to specifically target the `message` argument, which might contain a string or data that needs to be processed or validated.
 * 
 * **Use Cases**: 
 * - Accessing a specific argument named `message` passed to a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to perform operations like logging, validation, or transformation.
 * - Extracting a message from a set of arguments to display or process further in the application logic.
