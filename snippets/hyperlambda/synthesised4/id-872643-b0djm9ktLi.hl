/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL query on a SQLite database, specifically on the "Treatments" table. 
 * // It includes a left join with the "Patients" table using the "PatientID" as the join condition. 
 * // The query selects distinct columns and applies a where condition, although the specific conditions are not detailed. 
 * // 1. [data.read] - Initiates a read operation from the database.
 * // 2. [database-type] - Specifies the type of database, which is SQLite.
 * // 3. [table] - Indicates the table to query, "Treatments" in this case.
 * // 4. [join] - Performs a left join with the "Patients" table.
 * // 5. [as] - Aliases the "Patients" table as "PatientID" for the join.
 * // 6. [type] - Specifies the join type, which is "left".
 * // 7. [on] - Defines the join condition based on matching "PatientID" fields.
 * // 8. [columns] - Specifies the columns to select, using a distinct function.
 * // 9. [where] - Begins a where clause for filtering results, though conditions are not specified.
