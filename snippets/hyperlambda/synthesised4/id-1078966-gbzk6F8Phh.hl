/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] from the current context. It's commonly used to access the arguments passed into a function or slot, especially in dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are directly under the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `feedback-channel` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "feedback-channel". It is used to specifically target the "feedback-channel" argument within the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * **Use Cases:**
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where a function or endpoint needs to access a specific argument named "feedback-channel" that is passed to it, perhaps to determine where to send feedback or logs.
 * - It might also be used in a validation step to ensure that the "feedback-channel" argument is present and correctly configured before proceeding with further processing.
