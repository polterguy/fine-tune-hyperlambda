// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] block to define a specific case that will be executed if the value being evaluated matches the value of the [case] slot. In this context, the [case] slot is being used with a value of "bit varying", which means that if the value being evaluated by the [switch] matches "bit varying", the corresponding lambda object or code block under this [case] will be executed.
