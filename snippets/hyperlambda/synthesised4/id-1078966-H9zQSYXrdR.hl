/*
 * 1. `@.imported`: This iterator looks for the first node named "imported" in the current context. The `@` symbol signifies that it searches for a node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its siblings and ancestors. It will stop as soon as it finds the first occurrence of a node with the specified name. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve configuration or data nodes that are imported or included in the current context, allowing for dynamic adjustments based on imported settings.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to verify if certain data has been imported into the current execution context, such as checking if a module or library has been loaded.
