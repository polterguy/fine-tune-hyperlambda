// This Hyperlambda code initializes a loop using the [while] slot, which continues iterating as long as the value of [.i] is not equal to 10. During each iteration, it appends an [item] node to the [list] node and increments the value of [.i] by 1 using the [math.increment] slot. The loop effectively builds a list with a number of [item] nodes based on the initial value of [.i].
