// This Hyperlambda code snippet evaluates a logical AND condition. It checks if the type of a node, referenced by the expression in [type.eq], is equal to a specified type. The [and] slot ensures that all its child conditions must evaluate to true for the entire expression to be true. The [type.eq] slot compares the type of a node to a given type, returning true if they match.
