// 1. `@.dest` - This iterator searches for the first node named "dest" within the current node's hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through its ancestors until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located at any level above the current node in the hierarchy.
