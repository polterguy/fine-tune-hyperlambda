/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is useful for accessing the arguments section in a Hyperlambda script, which typically contains input parameters or configuration data for the script.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any nodes that are directly under the `.arguments` node, which could represent different arguments or parameters passed to the script.
 * 
 * 3. `foreignField` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `foreignField` from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is useful for accessing a specific argument or parameter named `foreignField` within the `.arguments` node, allowing the script to work with the value or properties of this particular argument.
