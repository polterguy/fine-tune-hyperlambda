// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the conversion of a node's value to a specific type. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the node referenced by [.dp/#]. The [convert] slot is used to change the node's type, utilizing the [type] slot to determine the target type based on the name of a node retrieved by [get-name] within a dynamically constructed expression. This allows for flexible type conversion based on node names.
