/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `supervised` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `supervised` from the previously retrieved child nodes. It is used to specifically access the `supervised` argument if it exists.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function to check if a specific argument named `supervised` has been provided and to access its value.
 * - It could be part of a validation process to ensure that a required argument named `supervised` is present in the input to a function or endpoint.
