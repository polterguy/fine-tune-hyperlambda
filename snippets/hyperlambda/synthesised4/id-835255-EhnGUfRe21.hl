/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [filename] exists within the children of the node referenced by [.dp]. If such a node exists, it executes a lambda that adds the nodes found at the [filename] path to the [values] node inside the [data.create] node, which is a child of the [for-each] node. This effectively appends the [filename] nodes to a collection of values if they are present. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Begins a conditional statement.
 * 2. [exists] - Checks if a [filename] node exists within [.dp]'s children.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the [exists] condition is true.
 * 4. [add] - Appends nodes to the [values] node inside [data.create].
 * 5. [get-nodes] - Retrieves the [filename] nodes to be added.
