// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the [unwrap] slot is applied with an expression that uses the "+" iterator followed by "/**", which implies it will forward evaluate and unwrap all descendant nodes of the current node, starting from the next sibling node. This allows for pre-evaluation of expressions within a lambda object, ensuring that the values are resolved before execution continues.
unwrap:x:+/**
