/*
 * This Hyperlambda code iterates over each child node of [.data] using [for-each], retrieves the name of each node with [get-name], and evaluates all its descendant nodes using [unwrap]. It then adds a new node to [.result] with [add], where each node has a [key] set to the name of the iterated node and a [val] containing the node's value. The process effectively transforms the [.data] nodes into a key-value structure within [.result]. 
 * 
 * 1. [for-each] - Iterates over each child node of [.data].
 * 2. [get-name] - Retrieves the name of the currently iterated node.
 * 3. [unwrap] - Evaluates all descendant nodes of the currently iterated node.
 * 4. [add] - Adds a new node to [.result] with a key-value structure.
 * 5. [key] - Sets the key to the name of the iterated node.
 * 6. [val] - Retrieves the value of the currently iterated node.
