// The [else] slot in Hyperlambda is used to define a block of code that will be executed if none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are met. Unlike [if] and [else-if], [else] does not require a condition and directly contains the actions to be executed. In this example, if the previous conditions are false, the [set-value] slot sets the value of the [.dest] node to "nope".
