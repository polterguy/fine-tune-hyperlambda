// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to dynamically append nodes into a destination node's children collection. It targets multiple destination nodes specified by the expression [../*/return-nodes/*/result]. The code creates a structure with nodes [title], [link], [condition], [price], and [thumbnail], each retrieving values from the currently iterated node, referenced by [.dp]. This allows for dynamic data aggregation and transformation based on the structure of the source nodes.
