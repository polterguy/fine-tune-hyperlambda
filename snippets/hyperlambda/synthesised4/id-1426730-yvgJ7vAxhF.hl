/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add a node to a specified location in a Hyperlambda object. The [add] slot is used to append a new child node to the node referenced by the expression in its value. In this case, it adds a node to the [.allow] node. The child node being added is constructed with a value determined by the result of the [strings.concat] slot, which concatenates multiple strings into a single string. The [.] node is used to specify a static value or a slot result, in this case, the result of [strings.concat]. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends a new child node to the specified node.
 * 2. [.] - Represents a static value or a slot result to be added.
 * 3. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into a single string, used here to determine the value of the node being added.
