// The [case] slot is used within a [switch] block to define a condition that, when matched, executes its associated lambda object. The [case] slot must have a value, which can be a constant or an expression, and it is compared against the evaluated value of the [switch] node. If the [case] value matches the [switch] value, the code within the [case] node is executed.
