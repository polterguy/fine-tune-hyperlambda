// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each item in a shopping cart, adding the price of each item to the total cart value. The [for-each] slot iterates through all items in the cart, and for each item, the [set-value] slot updates the total by adding the item's price to the current total using [math.add]. The [get-value] slot retrieves the price of each item during the iteration.
