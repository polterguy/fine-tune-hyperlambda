// The code snippet demonstrates how to execute a dynamic slot named "magic.ai.url.get" which retrieves a URL from the "Location" header of an HTTP GET response. It utilizes the [http.get] slot to perform the HTTP request and accesses the "Location" header using a lambda expression. The [headers] node is included to potentially add custom headers to the HTTP request.
execute:magic.ai.url.get
