// 1. `@.sql` - This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "sql" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards, looking for a sibling or ancestor node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to reference a node that is defined earlier in the structure, allowing you to access its value or children nodes. This iterator is particularly handy in scenarios where you have a complex hierarchy and need to access configuration or data nodes that are defined at a higher level in the hierarchy.
