// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to handle the result of an HTTP POST request by unwrapping the response and returning specific data. The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied as a value, effectively flattening the structure for easier access. The [return] slot is then used to output a structured result, which includes an [error] node set to true, indicating that an error has occurred. The [result] node retrieves the error message from the HTTP POST response using the expression `x:@http.post/*/content/*/error/*/message`, which navigates through the response structure to extract the error message from the content of the HTTP response. This pattern is useful for error handling in HTTP requests, allowing the developer to easily access and return error messages from a response.
unwrap:x:+/*
return
   error:bool:true
   result:x:@http.post/*/content/*/error/*/message
