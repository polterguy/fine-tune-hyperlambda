// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] and [strings.replace] slots to modify the value of a node. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.result] node by replacing occurrences of a specific string within it. The [strings.replace] slot is used to find and replace a substring within the [.result] node, where the first argument specifies the substring to be replaced, and the second argument specifies the replacement string. In this case, it replaces occurrences of "[[stream]]" with "true" within the [.result] node.
set-value:x:@.result
   strings.replace:x:@.result
      .:[[stream]]
      .:true
