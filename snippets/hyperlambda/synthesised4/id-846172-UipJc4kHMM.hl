// This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if the value of the [connection-string] node within the [.arguments] node is not equal to a specified value. The [not] slot negates the result of the [eq] slot, which compares the value of [connection-string] to a given value. If they are not equal, the overall expression evaluates to true.
