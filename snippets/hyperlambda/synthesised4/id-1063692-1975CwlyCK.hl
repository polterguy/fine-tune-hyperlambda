/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. It searches upwards in the hierarchy from the current node to find the [.arguments] node. This is often used in Hyperlambda to access the arguments passed to a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any node directly under the [.arguments] node, which typically represent individual arguments or parameters.
 * 
 * 3. `subject` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [subject]. It is used to specifically access the [subject] node among the children of the [.arguments] node, assuming such a node exists. This is useful for extracting a specific argument value from a set of parameters.
