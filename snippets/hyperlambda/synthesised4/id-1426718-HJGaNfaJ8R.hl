// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate an expression that traverses multiple levels in the node hierarchy, effectively evaluating and replacing the node's value with the result of the expression before the node is reached during execution. The expression "+/*/*/*" navigates through elder siblings and multiple child levels.
