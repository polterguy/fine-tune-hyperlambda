// This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the MIME type for a JSON case. The [case] slot checks for a specific condition, and if it matches, the [set-value] slot assigns the value "application/json" to the [.mime-type] node. This is useful for configuring content types in scenarios where different cases require specific MIME type settings.
case:.json
   set-value:x:@.mime-type
