/*
 * The code uses the [validators.default] slot to ensure that specific boolean nodes exist within the [.arguments] node. If any of these nodes (summarize, images, lists, code) do not exist, they are created with a default value of true. If they exist but have a null value, their value is set to true. This ensures that these nodes are always present and initialized with a default boolean value. 
 * 
 * 1. [validators.default] - Ensures specified nodes exist within the target node collection.
 * 2. [summarize] - A boolean node set to true by default.
 * 3. [images] - A boolean node set to true by default.
 * 4. [lists] - A boolean node set to true by default.
 * 5. [code] - A boolean node set to true by default.
