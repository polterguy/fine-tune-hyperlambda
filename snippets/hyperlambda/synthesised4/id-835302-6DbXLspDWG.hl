// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [switch] slot in Hyperlambda, which functions similarly to a switch/case block in traditional programming languages. It evaluates the value of the [switch] node and executes the first matching [case] node. In this example, the [switch] node evaluates the value of [.val], and if it matches "smallserial", the corresponding [case] block is executed. If no [case] matches, an optional [default] block can be executed. This mechanism allows for conditional execution based on the value of a node.
case:smallserial
