/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda) of the current node. It's useful for navigating to the next node in a sequence when you need to process or evaluate nodes that are siblings in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `/+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It continues the navigation to the next node in the sequence, which can be useful for iterating through a list of sibling nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `/*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It's used to access the child nodes of a particular node, allowing you to perform operations or evaluations on all its children.
 * 
 * 4. `/*` - This iterator again retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. This step further drills down into the hierarchy, accessing the children of the previously obtained child nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `/snippets` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "snippets". It's useful for targeting specific nodes by name within a hierarchy, allowing you to perform operations or evaluations specifically on nodes named "snippets".
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression could be used to navigate through a structured document or configuration file where you need to access and process nodes named "snippets" that are nested within a specific hierarchy.
 * - It could be useful in a content management system to locate and manipulate code snippets or text blocks within a complex document structure.
