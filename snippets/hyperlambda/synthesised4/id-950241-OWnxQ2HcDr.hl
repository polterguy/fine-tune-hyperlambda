// The code uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a substring within a string. It retrieves the target substring to be replaced using [get-value] from the node path [@.dp/#/*/what], and the replacement string from [@.dp/#/*/with], applying the replacement operation on the string located at [@.result].
strings.replace:x:@.result
   get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/what
