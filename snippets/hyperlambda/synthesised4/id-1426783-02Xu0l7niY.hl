/*
 * // The following Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve nodes.
 * // The [get-nodes] slot evaluates the expression provided in its value and returns the nodes that match the expression.
 * // In this example, the expression "@.fixed" is used, which means it will return the nodes that are children of the node named "fixed" in the current context.
 * // This is useful for accessing specific parts of a node graph structure for further processing or manipulation.
 * //
 * // 1. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes based on the expression "@.fixed", returning all nodes that are children of the "fixed" node.
