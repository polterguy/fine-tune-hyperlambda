// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses an [if] statement to compare the value of the current node (referenced by [.dp]) with a specified word from the [.arguments] node. If they are equal, it increments the value of the [counter] node using [math.increment]. The [eq] slot checks for equality, and [.lambda] contains the operation to execute if the condition is true.
