// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to dynamically add nodes to a destination node's children collection. It uses the [add] slot to append nodes, specified by the [get-nodes] slot, which retrieves all child nodes from a configuration section. The [add] slot's expression points to the elder sibling of its current node, ensuring the retrieved nodes are added to the correct location in the node hierarchy.
