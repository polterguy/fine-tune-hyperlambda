/*
 * 1. `@.data`: This iterator searches for the first node named `.data` in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for locating a specific node by name when you know its name but not its exact location in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator (`@.data`). It is used to access all direct child nodes of the `.data` node, allowing you to perform operations on or retrieve information from each of these child nodes.
