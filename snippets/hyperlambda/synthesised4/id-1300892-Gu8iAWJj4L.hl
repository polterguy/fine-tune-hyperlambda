/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a "Shipment" table, specifically selecting the "ShipmentId" and "DispatchDate" columns. It uses a [where] clause to filter the records based on the "WarehouseId" column, ensuring it matches the value retrieved from a node in the current execution context. The [yield] slot is then used to return the resulting set of shipments from the data read operation. This approach is useful for dynamically filtering shipments based on a specific warehouse identifier, allowing for flexible data retrieval based on runtime conditions. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.read] - Initiates a read operation from the database.
 * 2. [table] - Specifies the "Shipment" table to read data from.
 * 3. [columns] - Lists the columns "ShipmentId" and "DispatchDate" to be retrieved.
 * 4. [where] - Defines the condition for filtering the data.
 * 5. [and] - Combines multiple conditions, though only one is used here.
 * 6. [WarehouseId.eq] - Compares the "WarehouseId" column to a dynamic value.
 * 7. [yield] - Returns the filtered shipments as the result of the operation.
