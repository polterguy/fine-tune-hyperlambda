/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling of the current node. It moves to the next node below the current node in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access a node that is at the same level but declared after the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is used to access all direct children of a node, allowing you to perform operations on all these child nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of the nodes returned by the previous `*` iterator. This allows you to access the grandchildren of the node identified by the elder sibling. This can be useful for operations that need to consider multiple levels of hierarchy in a node structure.
