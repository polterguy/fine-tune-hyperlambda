// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of double spaces with a single space in the string value of the [.anchor] node. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first argument specifies the substring to look for (in this case, double spaces), and the second argument specifies the substring to replace it with (in this case, a single space). The expression [x:@.anchor] points to the node whose value will be modified.
