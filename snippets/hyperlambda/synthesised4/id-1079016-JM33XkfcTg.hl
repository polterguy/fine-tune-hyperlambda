/*
 * 1. `@.exe` - This iterator searches for the first node named `exe` in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node that might be a parent or an ancestor in the current execution context.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found `exe` node. It is used when you want to access all direct descendants of a particular node, allowing you to perform operations or checks on each of them.
 * 
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to include only nodes named `signal`. It is used to narrow down the node set to those that have a specific name, which is useful when you are interested in nodes with a particular role or data type within the children of the `exe` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to process or check all `signal` nodes that are children of an `exe` node. For example, it might be used in a system that handles execution signals, where each `signal` node represents a different signal that needs to be processed or logged.
 * - Another use case could be in a monitoring system where `signal` nodes represent different events or statuses that need to be evaluated or acted upon, and the `exe` node acts as a container for these events.
