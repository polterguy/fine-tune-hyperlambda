/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current context. It is used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda. This is useful when you need to work with input parameters provided to a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It allows you to access each individual argument passed to the function or slot. This is useful when you need to iterate over or examine all the arguments provided.
 * 
 * 3. `order` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "order" from the previously retrieved children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically access the "order" argument, which might represent a specific input parameter that you need to work with in your logic.
