// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used for creating switch-case constructs, allowing you to execute different code blocks based on the value of a specified expression. In this example, a [case] slot is used to evaluate a [mediumint] value, executing the corresponding code block when the case matches the value of the [mediumint] node. This structure is useful for handling multiple conditional branches in a clean and organized manner.
