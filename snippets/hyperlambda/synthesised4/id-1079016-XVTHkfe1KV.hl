/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before in its hierarchy that matches the given name. In this case, it looks for the first node named "result" in the current hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings but rather looks upwards in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to quickly access a node named "result" that is expected to be found earlier in the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate the value of a "result" node that is part of a larger structure, such as when processing the output of a computation or operation.
