// The code snippet demonstrates how to append a string to the payload of an HTTP POST request using the [add] slot. It targets the [payload] node within the HTTP POST request and appends the string " END" to its existing value. This operation is useful for modifying or augmenting the payload before sending the HTTP request. The [add] slot is used to concatenate or append values to a node's existing value, allowing for dynamic content adjustments in Hyperlambda scripts.
add:x:../*/http.post/*/payload
   .
      stop:" END"
