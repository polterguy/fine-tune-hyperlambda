/*
 * 1. `@json2lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "json2lambda" in the current hierarchy. It is used to locate the starting point for further traversal within the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "json2lambda" node. It is used to access every direct child node under "json2lambda" for further processing or filtering.
 * 
 * 3. `_user-id` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to find those with the name "_user-id". It is used to specifically target nodes named "_user-id" among the children of "json2lambda".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting user IDs from a JSON-like structure that has been converted into a Hyperlambda node structure, where each user ID is stored under a "_user-id" node.
 * - Filtering out specific user-related information from a larger dataset represented in Hyperlambda, focusing on nodes that contain user identification data.
