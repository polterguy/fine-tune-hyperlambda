// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [name] node within [.arguments] is equal to "Thomas". If the condition is true, it returns a node with the value "Hello boss". The [if] slot is used for conditional execution, and [eq] checks for equality. The [.lambda] node contains the code to execute if the condition is met, and [return] provides the output.
