// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" that is a sibling or a child of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it should find the first occurrence of a node with the specified name, which in this case is "sql". This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name within the current context or hierarchy, especially when dealing with SQL queries or commands stored within a node named "sql".
