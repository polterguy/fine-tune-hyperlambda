// The code snippet uses the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate expressions within a Hyperlambda node structure. It targets the node located at the path specified by the expression "x:+/*/*", effectively evaluating and replacing the node's value with the result of the expression before the instruction pointer reaches it. This allows for dynamic evaluation and assignment of values within the node graph, facilitating more flexible and dynamic Hyperlambda code execution.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
