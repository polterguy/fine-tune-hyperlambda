// 1. `@.extra` - This iterator searches for the first node named "extra" within the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node's siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you need to retrieve or manipulate data associated with a specific node named "extra" that might be located at different levels in the hierarchy. A potential use case could be accessing configuration or metadata stored in a node named "extra" that is shared across different parts of a Hyperlambda graph.
