// The [auth.ticket.in-role] slot checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to one or more specified roles, returning true if the user is in at least one of the roles. In this example, it verifies if the user is in the "root" role. This slot is typically used within an authenticated context, such as an HTTP endpoint, to conditionally allow or deny access based on user roles without throwing exceptions.
