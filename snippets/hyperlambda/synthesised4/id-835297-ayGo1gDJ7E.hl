// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to change the value of a node. It checks if a node named [case] has a value of "tinyint" and then sets the value of a node named [type] to "bool". The [set-value] slot is used to assign the new value, and the expression ensures that the correct node is targeted for the value change.
case:tinyint
   set-value:x:@.type
      .:bool
