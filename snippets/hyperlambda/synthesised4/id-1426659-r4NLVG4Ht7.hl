/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code evaluates a logical condition using the [not] and [and] slots. It checks if the HTTP status code obtained from an [http.get] request is not within the range of 200 to 299. The [mte] slot checks if the status code is more than or equal to 200, and the [lt] slot checks if it is less than 300. The [and] slot combines these two conditions, and the [not] slot negates the result. If the status code is outside this range, the overall expression evaluates to true.
 * // 1. [not] - Negates the result of the combined conditions.
 * // 2. [and] - Combines the two conditions to check if both are true.
 * // 3. [mte] - Checks if the HTTP status code is more than or equal to 200.
 * // 4. [lt] - Checks if the HTTP status code is less than 300.
