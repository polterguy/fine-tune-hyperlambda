/*
 * This code iterates over each node within [.file-data] using [for-each], and modifies their children's names. It changes the name of each child node to "prompt" using [set-name] with a dynamic expression referencing [.arguments/*/prompt]. Similarly, it changes another child node's name to "completion" using another [set-name] with a dynamic expression referencing [.arguments/*/completion]. This effectively renames nodes based on arguments provided. 
 * 
 * 1. [for-each] - Iterates over each node in [.file-data].
 * 2. [set-name] - Changes the name of nodes to "prompt" and "completion" using dynamic expressions.
 * 3. [@.dp/#/*] - References the current node's children during iteration.
 * 4. [@.arguments/*/prompt] - Dynamic expression to retrieve the "prompt" argument.
 * 5. [@.arguments/*/completion] - Dynamic expression to retrieve the "completion" argument.
