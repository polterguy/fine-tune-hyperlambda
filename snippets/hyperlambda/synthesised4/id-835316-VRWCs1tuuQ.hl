// This Hyperlambda code checks if there are any child nodes under [result] within the [execute] node. If such nodes exist, it concatenates a string to the [.new-prompt] node, which includes a message about the response from a workflow and the JSON representation of the result. It also sets the [.function-result] node to the JSON value of the result. The key slots used are [if], [exists], [set-value], and [strings.concat].
