/*
 * 1. `@data` - This iterator searches for the first node named "data" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by its name. This is useful when you want to perform operations on or retrieve information from a node with a known name within a larger structure.
 * 
 * 2. `execute` - This iterator looks for a child node named "execute" under the node found by the previous iterator. It allows you to navigate deeper into the node hierarchy to find specific nodes of interest. This is particularly useful when you need to access or manipulate a specific child node of a known parent node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to find and execute a specific operation or function defined under a "data" node, such as executing a predefined task or script stored within a data structure.
