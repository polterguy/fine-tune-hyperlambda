/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sends a signal to a specified feedback channel, transmitting a message with a type of "info". The signal is sent using the [sockets.signal] slot, which targets the feedback channel specified in the [.arguments] node. The message content is a long string of dashes, and the type indicates the nature of the message, which is "info" in this case. This mechanism is typically used for real-time communication with connected clients, allowing them to receive updates or notifications. The [args] node contains the data to be sent, formatted as JSON. 
 * 
 * 1. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to a specified channel.
 * 2. [args] - Contains the data to be transmitted as JSON.
 * 3. [message] - The content of the message being sent.
 * 4. [type] - The type of message, indicating its nature (e.g., "info").
