 * 1. `@io.folder.list-recursively`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "io.folder.list-recursively". It is used to locate a specific node within the current context that matches this name. This is useful when you want to perform operations on or retrieve information from a node that has a unique or specific name within a larger structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the result set from the previous iterator. In this context, it will gather all the child nodes of the "io.folder.list-recursively" node. This is often used when you need to process or evaluate all elements within a collection or list that is structured under a particular parent node.
