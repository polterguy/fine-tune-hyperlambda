/*
 * 1. `@.result` - This iterator searches for the first node named "result" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and their children, until it finds a node named "result". This is useful for accessing a specific node when you know its name but not its exact location in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "result" node. It is used to access any nodes that are directly nested under the "result" node, regardless of their names. This is helpful when you want to process or check all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `error` - This iterator filters the children of the "result" node to find nodes specifically named "error". It is used to pinpoint nodes that have a specific name, allowing you to perform operations or checks on those nodes. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to check for error messages or error codes within the result of an operation. For example, after executing a process, you may want to verify if any errors were logged under the "result" node to handle them appropriately.
