/*
 * 1. `@.prompt` - This iterator searches for the first node named "prompt" within the current node's siblings and itself. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to access a specific node that is on the same level or higher in the hierarchy, without needing to know its exact position relative to the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving configuration or metadata information stored in a sibling or ancestor node named "prompt".
 * - Accessing a specific node's value for conditional checks or further processing in a dynamic Hyperlambda script.
