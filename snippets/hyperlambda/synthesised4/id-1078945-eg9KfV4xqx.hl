// 1. `@lambda2json`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "lambda2json" from the current context. The `@` symbol is used to search for nodes by name. This is useful when you need to access specific nodes within a Hyperlambda structure, especially when dealing with configurations or data transformations where the node names are known and unique. A potential use case is converting a Hyperlambda structure to JSON format by accessing a node responsible for this transformation.
