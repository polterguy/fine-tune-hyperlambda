/*
 * 1. `@data.connect` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "data.connect" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy until it finds a node with this name. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node that might not be a direct child or sibling of the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "data.connect" node. It is used to access any nodes nested directly under "data.connect", allowing you to work with or manipulate these child nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "data.read" from the children of "data.connect". It is used to narrow down the selection to specific nodes of interest, in this case, nodes that are intended to perform a "read" operation related to data.
