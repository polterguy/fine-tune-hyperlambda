// // This Hyperlambda code retrieves all child nodes of the node referenced by the expression `@hyper2lambda/*`. The [get-nodes] slot is used to return the nodes specified by the expression, which in this case are all the children of the [hyper2lambda] node. This operation is useful for extracting a subset of nodes from a larger node structure for further processing or evaluation. The expression uses the `@` and `*` iterators to navigate the node hierarchy and select the desired nodes.
