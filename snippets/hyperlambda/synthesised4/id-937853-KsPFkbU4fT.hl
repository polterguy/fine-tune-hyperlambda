// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.select] slot to execute a SQL query that retrieves item details from a database. It selects specific fields from the "items" and "products" tables, joining them on the "product_id" field, and filters the results based on a session ID provided as an argument. The session ID is dynamically fetched from the [.arguments] node using a lambda expression.
data.select:"\nselect i.item_id, i.quantity, p.name, p.description, p.image_url, p.price\n   from items i inner join products p on i.product_id = p.product_id\n   where i.session_id = @session"
   @session:x:@.arguments/*/_session
