// This Hyperlambda code calculates a final score by combining weighted scores for logic and creativity. It uses [math.multiply] to multiply each score by its respective weight and then [math.add] to sum these products. The result is set as the value of [finalScore] using [set-value]. The slots involved are [set-value], [math.add], and [math.multiply].
