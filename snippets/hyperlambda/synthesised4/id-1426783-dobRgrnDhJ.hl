/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a block of code when previous conditional checks have failed. It adds the values obtained from the nodes specified by the expressions in [get-nodes] under [.arguments] with names [to] and [from], and assigns the result to the node specified by the expression in [add]. The [else] slot is used to ensure that this operation only occurs if none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are met.
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes the subsequent code block if no prior conditions are met.
 * 2. [add] - Adds the values obtained from the specified nodes.
 * 3. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes specified by the expression under [.arguments] with names [to] and [from].
