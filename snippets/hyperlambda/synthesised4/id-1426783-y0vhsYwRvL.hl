/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sends a signal to a specific session using the [sockets.signal] slot. It transmits an argument named [finish_reason] to the subscribers of the session, where the value of [finish_reason] is dynamically retrieved from the current context. This allows for real-time communication with the specified session, passing along relevant information encapsulated in the [finish_reason] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to the specified session.
 * 2. [args] - Contains the arguments to transmit to the session.
 * 3. [finish_reason] - The argument being transmitted, with its value dynamically retrieved from the current context.
