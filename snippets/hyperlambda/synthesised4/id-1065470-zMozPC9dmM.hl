// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` symbol specifies that it should start the search from the current node's context. This is useful for retrieving a specific node that might contain SQL-related data or configuration, which can then be used for further processing or execution within the Hyperlambda script.
