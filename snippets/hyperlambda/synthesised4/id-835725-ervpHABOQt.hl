// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet changes the name of nodes under a specific path to a concatenated string. It uses [set-name] to target nodes at the path [./*/data.read/*/columns/*/aggregate_functor]. The new name is constructed by concatenating the value of [aggregate_function] and [aggregate_column] from [.arguments], with parentheses around the [aggregate_column] value. This effectively renames nodes to represent an SQL aggregate function format.
