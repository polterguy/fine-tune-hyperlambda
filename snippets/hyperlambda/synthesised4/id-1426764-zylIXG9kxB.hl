// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to add a new node with a child node to a specified location in the node structure. The [add] slot targets all children of the [.tmp] node and inserts a new node with a child node named [primary] having a boolean value of false. This operation effectively appends a new node structure under each child node of [.tmp].
