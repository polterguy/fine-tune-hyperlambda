// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [insert-before] slot to insert a new node before a specified node in a Hyperlambda structure. It targets the node [chapter1] under the [book] node and inserts a new node named [chapter0] with the value "Introduction chapter" before it. This allows for modifying the structure by adding new elements at specific positions.
