/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet checks if the value of the [session] node within the [.arguments] node is not equal to null. If the [session] node does not exist or its value is null, the [neq] slot will evaluate to false; otherwise, it will evaluate to true. This is useful for validating that a session argument is provided and has a value. 
 * 
 * 1. [neq] - Compares the value of the [session] node to null and evaluates to true if they are not equal.
 * 2. [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/session] - Retrieves the value of the [session] node from the [.arguments] node.
