// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-name] slot to change the name of nodes referenced by its expression to a concatenated string. It employs [strings.concat] to construct a new name by combining the string "count(distinct ", the value of the [distinct_column] argument, and a closing parenthesis. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [distinct_column] argument to include it in the concatenated string.
