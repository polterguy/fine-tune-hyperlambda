// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced, allowing forward evaluation of expressions. In this example, [unwrap] is used to evaluate the expression at the current node, ensuring that the value is processed before reaching the [.dest] node. This is useful for dynamically evaluating expressions within a lambda object.
