// The Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a left join operation between two tables, "comments" and "users", using the "user_id" field from "comments" and the "id" field from "users". It specifies the join type as "left" and uses an alias "user_id" for the "users" table. The join condition is defined using an "and" logical operator to ensure that the "user_id" from "comments" matches the "id" from the "users" table.
join:users
