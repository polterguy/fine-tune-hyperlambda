// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached, allowing you to forward evaluate expressions inside your lambda object. In this example, [unwrap] is used with an expression that navigates through the node hierarchy, effectively evaluating and setting the value of the target node before it is processed. The expression "+/*/*" traverses the node structure to locate the desired node for evaluation.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
