// This Hyperlambda code constructs a connection string by concatenating a series of values and assigns it to the [.connection] node. It uses [strings.concat] to combine a connection string, a pipe character, and a database name, all enclosed in square brackets. The [set-value] slot is used to assign the resulting concatenated string to the [.connection] node.
