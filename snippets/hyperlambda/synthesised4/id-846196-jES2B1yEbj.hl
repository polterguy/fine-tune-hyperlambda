// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [supervised] exists within [.arguments], is not null, and has an integer value of 1. It uses [and] to ensure all conditions are true: [exists] verifies the node's presence, [not-null] checks its value, and [eq] confirms its integer value after conversion.
