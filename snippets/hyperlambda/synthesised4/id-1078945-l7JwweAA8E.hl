/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a Hyperlambda function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of `.arguments`.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `session`. It is used to specifically access the `session` argument if it exists among the children of `.arguments`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to access a specific argument named `session` that is passed to a Hyperlambda function or endpoint. It can be used to retrieve session-related data for further processing or validation within the Hyperlambda code.
