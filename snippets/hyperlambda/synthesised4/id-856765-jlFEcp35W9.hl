/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses logical conditions to evaluate whether a specific node exists and has a non-null value. The [and] slot ensures both conditions are true: [not-null] checks if the [auth] node under [.model] has a value, and [neq] confirms that this value is not an empty string. If both conditions are satisfied, the [and] slot will evaluate to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Combines multiple conditions and evaluates to true if all conditions are true.
 * 2. [not-null] - Checks if the [auth] node under [.model] has a non-null value.
 * 3. [neq] - Ensures the value of the [auth] node is not an empty string.
