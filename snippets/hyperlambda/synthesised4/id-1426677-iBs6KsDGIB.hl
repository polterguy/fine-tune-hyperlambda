// The Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied as a value to unwrap itself. It targets the node with the name "type" that is a child of a node with the name "magic.ai.crawl-site" within the current context. This allows for dynamic evaluation and execution of the specified node's children, effectively "unwrapping" the node's content for further processing or evaluation.
