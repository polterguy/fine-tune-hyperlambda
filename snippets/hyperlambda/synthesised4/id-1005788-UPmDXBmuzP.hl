/*
 * 1. `@io.file.list` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "io.file.list" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary, but does not traverse siblings.
 *    
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node found by the previous iterator. In this context, it will return all child nodes of the "io.file.list" node. 
 * 
 * This expression is useful for accessing and manipulating all child nodes of a specific node named "io.file.list" within a Hyperlambda graph, which might represent a list of files or similar data structure.
