/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator starts by locating the first node with the name "session" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for the node by name, and the `.` signifies that it will begin the search from the current node's level or above in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "session" node. The `*` symbol is used to access every child node directly under the "session" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to access all session-related data stored under a "session" node. For example, in a web application, it might be used to retrieve all session variables or settings for the current user session.
 * - It could also be useful for debugging purposes, allowing a developer to inspect all session data at a particular point in the execution of a Hyperlambda script.
