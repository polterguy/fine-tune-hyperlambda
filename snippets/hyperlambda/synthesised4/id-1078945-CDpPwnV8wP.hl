/*
 * 1. `+` - This iterator retrieves the elder sibling (next node or the node below it in the Hyperlambda) of the current node. It is useful when you need to access the node immediately following the current node in a sequence.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. When used after the `+` iterator, it will fetch all children of the elder sibling node identified by the `+` iterator. This is useful for accessing all child nodes of a specific sibling node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator, used again, retrieves all children nodes of the result set from the previous `*` iterator. This effectively allows you to access the grandchildren of the elder sibling node initially identified by the `+` iterator. This is useful for deep traversal when you need to access nodes two levels down from a specific sibling node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to process or evaluate data that is structured hierarchically, and you are interested in accessing and manipulating the grandchildren of a specific node's elder sibling. For example, if you have a configuration or data structure where settings or parameters are nested, and you need to apply operations or transformations to all nested parameters of a particular section.
