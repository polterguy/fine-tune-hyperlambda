// This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database named "chinook" and deletes records from the "InvoiceLine" table. It adds conditions to the "where" clause by retrieving nodes from the arguments and appending them to the "and" node. The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions, and the [return] slot returns the number of affected rows from the delete operation.
