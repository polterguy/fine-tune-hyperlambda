// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to assign the value obtained from the [get-value] slot, which retrieves the result of the [html2markdown] conversion, to the [.markdown] node. The [set-value] slot changes the value of the specified node, while [get-value] retrieves the value of another node.
