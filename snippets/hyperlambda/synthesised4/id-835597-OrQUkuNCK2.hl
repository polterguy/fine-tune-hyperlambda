// This Hyperlambda code uses the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the value of [aggregate_function] within [.arguments] is one of the specified legal values: "min", "max", "sum", or "avg". If the value does not match any of these, an exception is thrown. This is useful for validating that the input conforms to expected aggregate functions.
