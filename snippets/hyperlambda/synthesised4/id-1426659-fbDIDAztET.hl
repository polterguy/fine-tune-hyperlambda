/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the value of specific header nodes (h3, h4, h5, h6) within a [page-header] node. It retrieves the value from a [prompt] node and assigns it to the [h3] node, while the other header nodes (h4, h5, h6) are also targeted by [set-value] slots, although their source value is not specified. 
 * 
 * 1. [case] - This is a switch case statement that executes its children if the case matches.
 * 2. [set-value] - Changes the value of the specified node(s) to the result of its child node or expression.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [prompt] node to be used as the new value for the [h3] node.
