/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator searches for the first node in the hierarchy with the specified name that comes before the current node. It does not traverse siblings but rather looks upwards in the hierarchy to find the node. This is useful when you want to reference a node that is an ancestor of the current node, ensuring that you are accessing a node that is logically above the current context in the node structure.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or context nodes that are defined at a higher level in the hierarchy.
 * - Retrieving a parent node's value or attributes when processing child nodes.
