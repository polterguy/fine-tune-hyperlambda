/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes from one location to another within the node structure. The [add] slot is used to append nodes to a specified destination. In this example, the nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot from the [.allow] node are added to the children of the node that is two levels up from the current context.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - This slot is used to append nodes to a specified destination.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves the nodes from the [.allow] node to be added to the destination specified by [add].
