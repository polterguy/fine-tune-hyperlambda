/*
 * 1. `@data` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "data" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks through siblings and ancestors to find the node named "data". This is useful when you want to directly access a specific node by its name within the current scope.
 * 
 * 2. `scalar` - Once the "data" node is found, this iterator looks for a child node named "scalar" under the "data" node. It retrieves the first occurrence of a child node with the name "scalar". This is useful for accessing specific data or configuration stored within a structured node hierarchy.
