// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot, which is part of a switch-case construct. The [case] slot is used to define a specific condition or value to match against within a [switch] block. When the value or condition specified in the [case] slot matches the value being evaluated by the [switch] block, the associated code block is executed. This allows for conditional branching based on multiple potential values or conditions, similar to a switch-case statement in other programming languages.
