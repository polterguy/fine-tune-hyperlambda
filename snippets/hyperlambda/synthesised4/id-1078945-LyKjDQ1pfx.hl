 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator is used to retrieve the first node named "session" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches upwards in the hierarchy starting from the current node's position. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing session-related data or metadata in a web application where session management is implemented.
 * - Retrieving session variables or settings that are stored in a node named "session" for further processing or validation.
