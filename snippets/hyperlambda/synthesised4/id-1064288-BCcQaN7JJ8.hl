/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 *    
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument individually.
 * 
 * 3. `direction` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `direction` from the children of the `.arguments` node. This is typically used to access a specific argument named `direction` that might be passed to a function or slot.
