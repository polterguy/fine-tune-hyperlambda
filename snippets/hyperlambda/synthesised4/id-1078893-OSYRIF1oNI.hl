/*
 * 1. `@.files`: This iterator searches for the first node in the current context with the name "files". It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with this name. This is useful for accessing a specific node that might be located at different levels in the hierarchy, ensuring you get the correct node regardless of its position relative to the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access file-related data or configurations stored in a node named "files" within a larger data structure, such as retrieving a list of files or file metadata in a configuration or data processing task.
