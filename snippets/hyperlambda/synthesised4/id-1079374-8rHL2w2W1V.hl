/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` symbol specifies that it should start from the current node and look upwards in the hierarchy. This is useful for referencing a SQL query or command node that might be defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve a SQL command or query that is defined in a node named "sql" within the current context, allowing the Hyperlambda code to execute or manipulate the SQL command as needed.
