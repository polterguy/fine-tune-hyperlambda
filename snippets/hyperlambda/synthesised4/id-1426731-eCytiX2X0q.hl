/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [url] node within the [.arguments] node is equal to the value obtained from trimming the end of a string using [strings.trim-end]. It uses the [eq] slot to compare these two values for equality. 
 * 
 * 1. [eq] - Compares two values for equality.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 3. [strings.trim-end] - Trims the end of a string, removing specified characters.
