// 1. `@.fields`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "fields" that is encountered in the current hierarchy, starting from the current node and moving upwards. It is useful for accessing specific nodes that are not direct children of the current node, allowing you to reference nodes that are part of the broader structure or context.
