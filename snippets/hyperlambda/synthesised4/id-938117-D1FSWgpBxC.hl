// This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database named "magic" and reads from the "questionnaires" table to count the number of records. It uses [data.read] to perform the SQL operation, specifying the database type as SQLite, and includes a [where] clause with an [and] condition. The result is limited to one record, and the count is returned using [return-nodes]. The [add] slot is used to dynamically add nodes to the [where] clause from the [.arguments] node.
