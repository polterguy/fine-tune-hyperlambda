// This Hyperlambda code checks if the currently authenticated user belongs to the "root" role. It uses the [auth.ticket.in-role] slot to verify the user's role membership without throwing an exception, returning true if the user is in the specified role and false otherwise. This slot is typically used within an authenticated context, such as an HTTP endpoint.
auth.ticket.in-role:root
