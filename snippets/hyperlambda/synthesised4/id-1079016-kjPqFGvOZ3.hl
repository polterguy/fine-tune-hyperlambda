/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for the first occurrence of a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for accessing the arguments node in a Hyperlambda file, which typically contains parameters or input data for a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `.arguments` node. The `*` symbol is used to access all children, which allows for iterating over or examining each argument provided to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `prefix`: This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes that have the name `prefix`. It is used to specifically target nodes that are named `prefix` among the children of the `.arguments` node. This is useful when you want to extract or manipulate a specific argument named `prefix` from the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function to retrieve the value of an argument named `prefix` that is passed to the function. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the function needs to perform operations based on a specific prefix value provided by the caller.
 * - It could also be used in an HTTP endpoint to validate or process a query parameter or form field named `prefix` that is part of the request.
