// This Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to forward evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. The expression "x:+/*/*" is evaluated, and the result is used in place of the [unwrap] node. This allows the code to dynamically adjust its structure or values based on the evaluated expression before continuing execution. The [unwrap] slot is particularly useful for preparing data or structure in advance, ensuring that the subsequent nodes operate on the most current and relevant data.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
