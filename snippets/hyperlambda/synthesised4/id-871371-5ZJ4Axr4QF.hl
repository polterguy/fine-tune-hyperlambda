// This Hyperlambda code connects to a SQLite database named "northwind" and performs a query on the "Orders" table. It joins the "Employees" and "Shippers" tables using left joins on specific fields, and selects a count of records. The query includes a condition specified in the [where] clause, and limits the result to one record. The final result is returned using [return-nodes]. The [add] slot is used to add nodes to the [where] clause dynamically from the [.arguments] node.
