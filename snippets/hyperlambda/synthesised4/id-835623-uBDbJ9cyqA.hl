// This Hyperlambda code uses the [auth.ticket.verify] slot to ensure that the currently authenticated user belongs to the "admin" role. If the user does not have this role, the slot will throw an exception, preventing further execution. This is typically used to secure endpoints by restricting access to users with specific roles.
