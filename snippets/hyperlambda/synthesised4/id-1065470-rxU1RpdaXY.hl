/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda file or HTTP endpoint, which contains the parameters passed to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument node individually, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `/offset` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named `offset` among the children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to specifically access the `offset` argument, which might represent a numeric value indicating a starting point or position in a list or sequence for operations like pagination or slicing.
