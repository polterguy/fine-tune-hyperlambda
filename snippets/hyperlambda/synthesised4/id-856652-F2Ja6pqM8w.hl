// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] construct to define possible execution paths based on a matching value. Each [case] node should have a value, which can be a constant or an expression, and the [switch] will execute the first [case] node whose value matches the evaluated value of the [switch]. If no [case] matches, an optional [default] node can be executed.
