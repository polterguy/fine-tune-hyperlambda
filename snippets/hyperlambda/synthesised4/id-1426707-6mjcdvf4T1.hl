// This Hyperlambda code reads data from a stream specified in the [stream] node under the [file] node within the [.arguments] node. The [io.stream.read] slot is used to read the content of the stream, which is typically part of an HTTP request or another data source that provides a stream interface. The result of the read operation is stored in the [io.stream.read] node.
