// This Hyperlambda code sends a signal using the [sockets.signal] slot, targeting a session specified in the [.arguments] node. The [args] node contains a single child node [audio], which is populated with the content retrieved from an HTTP POST request. The [http.post] slot is used to perform the HTTP request, and its response content is extracted and assigned to the [audio] node, which is then transmitted as part of the signal.
