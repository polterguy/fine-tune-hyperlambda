// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [add] slot to dynamically insert nodes into a specified destination node. It adds a new node with children nodes [name], [expression], and [complete] to each [candidates] node found in the [return] node's children. The [name] and [expression] nodes are set to the value of [x], while [complete] is set to false.
