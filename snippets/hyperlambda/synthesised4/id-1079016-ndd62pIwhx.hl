/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or slot, especially in the context of HTTP endpoints or dynamic slot executions.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access all the arguments that have been passed into the current context.
 * 
 * 3. `session` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `session`. It is used to specifically access the `session` argument from the list of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in an HTTP endpoint to retrieve the session information passed as an argument, which might be necessary for session management or authentication purposes.
 * - In a dynamic slot, it could be used to access session-specific data to perform operations that depend on the user's session state.
