// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to construct a URL by concatenating a base URL with a user ID retrieved from the arguments. The [set-value] slot changes the value of the node it points to, using the result from the [strings.concat] slot, which concatenates a static string with the value obtained from [get-value] that retrieves the user ID from the arguments.
set-value:x:-
   strings.concat
      .:"https://api.example.com/users/"
      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/userId
