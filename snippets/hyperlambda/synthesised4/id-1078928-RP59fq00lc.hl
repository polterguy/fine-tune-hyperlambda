/*
 * 1. `@openai.tokenize`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "openai.tokenize" in the current context. It acts as a starting point for further navigation within the node structure. A potential use case for this iterator is to locate a specific node responsible for tokenizing text within a larger Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `@openai.tokenize`: After finding the first "openai.tokenize" node, this iterator again searches for the first node with the name "openai.tokenize" within the children of the previously found node. This suggests a nested structure where the "openai.tokenize" node contains another "openai.tokenize" node as a child. A potential use case for this expression is to handle scenarios where tokenization logic is organized in a hierarchical manner, allowing for layered or recursive tokenization processes.
