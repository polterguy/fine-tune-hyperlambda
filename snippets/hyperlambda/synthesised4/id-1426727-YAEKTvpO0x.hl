// The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expression provided in its value before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this case, the expression "+/**" is evaluated, which typically means it will evaluate the current node's elder sibling and all its descendants. This slot is useful for forward evaluating expressions inside a lambda object before the lambda object is actually executed.
unwrap:x:+/**
