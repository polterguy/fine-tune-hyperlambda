// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a destination node's children collection. It retrieves nodes using [get-nodes] from a reference node [.dp] and adds them to a node named [.remaining]. The [add] slot dynamically evaluates its children before appending them to the destination.

   add:x:@.remaining
      get-nodes:x:@.dp/#
