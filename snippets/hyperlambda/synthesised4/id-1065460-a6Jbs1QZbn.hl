/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda execution context, which contains all the arguments passed to a slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed to the slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `query` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "query" among the children of the "arguments" node. This is useful for accessing a specific argument named "query" that might be passed to a slot or endpoint.
