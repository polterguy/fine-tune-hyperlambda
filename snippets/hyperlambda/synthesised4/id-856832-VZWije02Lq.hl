// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of a node named "src" that is a child of the node referenced by the [.dp] node, which is passed by reference. The expression [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/src] uses the [get-value] slot to access the value of the "src" node, navigating through the hierarchy using lambda expressions.
