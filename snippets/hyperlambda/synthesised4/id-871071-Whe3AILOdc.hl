// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [context] slot to store a value in a stack, which can be later retrieved using [get-context]. It sets a context named "foo" with a value "bar" and within a lambda, retrieves this value to set it to [.result] using [get-context]. This mechanism is useful for maintaining data accessibility throughout the execution of a Hyperlambda snippet without passing it as an argument.
