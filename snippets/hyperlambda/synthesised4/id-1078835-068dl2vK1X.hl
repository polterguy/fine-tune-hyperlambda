/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.dp] in the current context. The [.dp] node is often used in loops or iterations, such as in [for-each] loops, where it represents the current node being processed. In this context, it serves as the starting point for further navigation.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the [.dp] node. It implies that the value of [.dp] is another node, and this iterator allows access to that node by reference. This is useful when you want to manipulate or access the original node rather than a copy.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous result set. In this case, it gets all children of the node referenced by the value of [.dp].
 * 
 * 4. `type` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "type". It is used to find specific nodes among the children of the node referenced by [.dp].
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a [for-each] loop to iterate over a collection of nodes, where each node represents an entity with a "type" attribute. The expression would allow you to access and process the "type" attribute of each entity.
 * - It can be used in a context where you need to validate or perform operations based on the "type" of various nodes, such as filtering nodes by type or aggregating data based on type.
