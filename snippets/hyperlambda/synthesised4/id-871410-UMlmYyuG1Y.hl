// The code snippet uses the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the [distinct_column] argument is one of the specified valid values. It checks if the provided column name matches any of the allowed options, such as "activities.activity_id", "activities.client_id", "activities.type", "activities.date", "activities.notes", or "client_id.name". If the value does not match any of these, an exception is thrown.
