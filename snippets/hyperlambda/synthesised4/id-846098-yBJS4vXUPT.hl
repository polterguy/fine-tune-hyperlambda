// This code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] and [strings.replace] slots in Hyperlambda. It modifies the value of the [.result] node by replacing occurrences of the string "[[submit_button]]" with "false" within its current value. The [strings.replace] slot is used to perform the string replacement operation, and the [set-value] slot assigns the modified string back to the [.result] node.
set-value:x:@.result
   strings.replace:x:@.result
      .:[[submit_button]]
      .:false
