// This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to read data from a database table named "Shipment" and filter the results based on a specific condition. The [data.read] slot is used to specify the table from which data is to be retrieved, in this case, the "Shipment" table. The [where] clause is utilized to apply a filter condition, which is defined using an [and] logical operator. The condition checks for equality between the "TraderID" column in the "Shipment" table and a dynamically retrieved value. This value is obtained through an expression that navigates the current node structure to find the "TraderID" node within a data segment, using the expression `x:@.dp/#/*/TraderID`. The [yield] slot is then used to return the filtered shipments, which are extracted from the results of the [data.read] operation. This approach is useful for dynamically filtering shipments based on trader information that might be passed in or calculated at runtime.
