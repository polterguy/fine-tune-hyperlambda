// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [mssql.create] slot to insert a new record into the "users" table. It specifies the values for the "username", "email", and "is_active" fields. The [return-id] argument is set to true, indicating that the ID of the newly inserted record should be returned. This ensures that the operation not only inserts the data but also retrieves the unique identifier of the inserted record for further use.
