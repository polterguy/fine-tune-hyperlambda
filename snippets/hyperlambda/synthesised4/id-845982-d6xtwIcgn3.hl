// The code snippet uses the [eq] slot to compare the value obtained from the [get-value] slot, which retrieves the value of the [produces] node within the [hyper2lambda] node, to the static string "application/json". If the values are equal, the condition is true. This is useful for checking if a specific node's value matches a given string.
