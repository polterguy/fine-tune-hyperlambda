// This Hyperlambda code checks if a file named "errors.log" exists in the "/logs" directory using [io.file.exists]. If the file exists, it deletes the file with [io.file.delete] and sets the value of [.result] to "Log file deleted." using [set-value]. The [if] slot ensures that the deletion and value setting only occur if the file is present.

      set-value:x:@.result
