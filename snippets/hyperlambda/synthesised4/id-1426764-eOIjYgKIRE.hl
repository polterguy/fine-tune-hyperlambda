/*
 * The [case:integer] slot is used within a [switch] statement to handle specific cases based on integer values. It allows you to execute a block of code when the value being evaluated matches the specified integer value. Below is an example of how it can be used.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Initiates a switch statement to evaluate a specific value or expression.
 * 2. [case:integer] - Specifies a case within the switch statement that matches an integer value.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the block of code to execute if the case condition is met.
 * 4. [log.info] - Logs an informational message indicating that the case condition was met.
 * 
 * The [case:integer] slot is useful for handling different scenarios based on integer values, allowing for cleaner and more organized conditional branching compared to multiple [if] statements.
