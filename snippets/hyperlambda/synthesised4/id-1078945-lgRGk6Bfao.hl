/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context that has the name "session". It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, looking for a node with the specified name. This is useful for accessing session-related data or configurations that are stored in a node named "session". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing user session information in a web application to retrieve user-specific data.
 * - Retrieving session configuration settings in a multi-user environment to apply user-specific logic or settings.
