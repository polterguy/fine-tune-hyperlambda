// The code checks if a node exists and is not null, and then verifies that its value is not equal to an empty string. It uses [and] to combine these conditions, ensuring all must be true for the overall evaluation to be true. The [exists] slot checks for the presence of the node, [not-null] ensures it has a value, and [neq] confirms the value is not an empty string.
