// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Employees" and "ReportsTo". The join is aliased as "ReportsTo" and matches rows where the "ReportsTo" column in the "Employees" table corresponds to the "EmployeeID" in the "ReportsTo" table. The [join] slot specifies the join type, alias, and conditions for the join operation.
join:Employees
   as:ReportsTo
