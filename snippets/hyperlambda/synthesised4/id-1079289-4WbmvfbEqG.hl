/*
 * 1. `@data.connect`: This iterator searches for the first node named "data.connect" within the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is useful for locating a specific connection node, such as a database connection configuration, within a larger Hyperlambda graph.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.connect" node. It allows you to access any configuration or parameters that are direct children of the "data.connect" node. This is useful for accessing multiple settings or parameters related to a database connection.
 * 
 * 3. `data.select`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "data.select" among the children of "data.connect". This is useful for finding specific query nodes or operations that are meant to select data from a data source.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda script to find and execute a specific data selection operation that is configured under a database connection node. This is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple data operations are defined, and you need to dynamically select and execute one based on its name.
