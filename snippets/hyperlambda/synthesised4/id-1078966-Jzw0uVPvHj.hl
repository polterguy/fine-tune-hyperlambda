/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda, which is often structured with an `.arguments` node at the top level.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. This is useful for accessing all the individual argument nodes that are passed to a function or a slot.
 * 
 * 3. `summarize` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `summarize`. This is used to specifically target the `summarize` argument, which might be used for operations like summarizing text or data within the context of the function or slot.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a function or slot that processes arguments to find a specific `summarize` argument, which might contain instructions or data for summarizing content.
 * - It could be part of a larger logic that checks for the presence of a `summarize` argument to decide whether to perform a summarization operation on some input data.
