/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" within the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an HTTP endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "arguments" node. It is used to access all the arguments provided.
 * 3. `referrer`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "referrer" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically access the "referrer" argument, if it exists.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in an HTTP endpoint to retrieve the value of a "referrer" argument, which might contain information about the source of a request.
 * - It can be used in a logging or analytics system to track where requests are coming from, helping in understanding user behavior or traffic sources.
