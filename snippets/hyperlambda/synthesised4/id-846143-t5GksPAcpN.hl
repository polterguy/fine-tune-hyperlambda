// The Hyperlambda code retrieves all child nodes of the [headers] node within the [.arguments] node. This is achieved using the [get-nodes] slot, which returns the nodes specified by its expression. The expression uses the `@` iterator to locate the [.arguments] node, followed by `*` to access its children, and finally filters for the [headers] node.
