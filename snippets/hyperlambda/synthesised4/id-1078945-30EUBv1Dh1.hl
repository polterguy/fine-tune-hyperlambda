// - `@.only-prompt`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "only-prompt" at the current level of the hierarchy or among its ancestors. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, checking each node's name. If it finds a node named "only-prompt", it returns that node. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that might be located at any level above the current node, ensuring that you can retrieve configuration or context information defined higher up in the hierarchy.
