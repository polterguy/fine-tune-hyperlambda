// This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates the use of the [math.multiply] slot to perform multiplication. It first uses [math.add] to add two integers, 1 and 2, resulting in 3, and then multiplies this result by 5, yielding a final result of 15. The [math.add] slot is nested within [math.multiply] to perform these operations sequentially.
