// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to insert nodes into a destination node's children collection. It targets the [.session] node and appends a new node structure with a [role] node set to "user" and a [content] node whose value is derived from the [prompt] argument in [.arguments]. The [add] slot facilitates dynamic node manipulation by evaluating and adding nodes to specified destinations.
