/*
 * This Hyperlambda code logs an error message when something goes wrong during the invocation of an HTTP POST request to Ollama. It captures the error message from the HTTP response, the status code of the HTTP request, and the entire lambda object in its current state. The error message is retrieved from the HTTP response's content, the status is taken from the HTTP POST request, and the lambda object is serialized to a Hyperlambda string for logging purposes.
 * 
 * 1. [log.error] - Logs an error message with a custom description.
 * 2. [message] - Retrieves the error message from the HTTP POST response content.
 * 3. [status] - Retrieves the status code from the HTTP POST request.
 * 4. [error] - Serializes the current lambda object to a Hyperlambda string for logging.
