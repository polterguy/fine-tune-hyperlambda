// This Hyperlambda code uses the [strings.replace-not-of] slot to replace every character in the input string that is not a lowercase letter, digit, or underscore with an underscore. It first converts the input string to lowercase using [strings.to-lower], then applies the replacement. The slot [strings.replace-not-of] takes two arguments: the first is a set of allowed characters, and the second is the replacement character. The code effectively sanitizes the input string by ensuring only the specified characters remain, replacing all others with an underscore.
