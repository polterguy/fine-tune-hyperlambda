// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, it evaluates all children nodes of the [return] node, effectively "unwrapping" them. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions within a lambda object before execution. The slot is applied to the children of the [return] node, ensuring their values are evaluated and ready for subsequent processing.
