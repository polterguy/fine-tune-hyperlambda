/*
 * The code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot to handle a "Crawl-delay" scenario, where different actions are taken based on the value of a [switch] statement. The [switch] slot evaluates the value of a specified node, and the [case] slots define the actions for specific values. The [default] slot provides a fallback action if none of the [case] conditions are met. This structure allows for flexible and organized handling of multiple conditions within a single [switch] block.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Evaluates the value of a specified node.
 * 2. [case] - Defines actions for specific values in the [switch] statement.
 * 3. [default] - Provides a fallback action if no [case] conditions are met.
