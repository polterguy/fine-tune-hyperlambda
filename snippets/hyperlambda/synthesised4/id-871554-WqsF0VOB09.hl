// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [throw] slot in Hyperlambda to raise an exception. The [throw] slot takes an expression pointing to a node, and the exception message is derived from the value of this node. In this example, the [throw] slot uses the expression [x:@.dp/#] to reference the value of the [.dp] node, which is typically used in loops or dynamic slot executions to refer to the current node being processed. When executed, this will throw an exception with the message being the value of the [.dp] node.
throw:x:@.dp/#
