// The [return-nodes] slot is used to return a set of nodes from a dynamically created slot. It can only be invoked within a dynamic slot or other contexts that explicitly create a return context. In the example, a dynamic slot named "foo" is created, which returns two nodes: [integer-value] with an integer value of 57, and [string-value] with a string value "Foo bar". The [signal] slot is then used to invoke the "foo" slot, effectively executing the return operation.
