// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot to execute a user creation process using the [magic.auth.create-user] slot. It passes in user details such as username, password, and roles, along with additional information like email and name, extracted from the [.arguments] node. The [is_hashed] argument specifies if the password is already hashed. This code is typically used in scenarios where a user needs to be created with specific roles and extra attributes.
