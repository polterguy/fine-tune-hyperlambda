// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [validators.default] slot in Hyperlambda. This slot ensures that if the specified node (in this case, [limit]) does not exist within the node collection pointed to by its expression, it will be appended with a default value. If the node exists but has a null value, it sets its value to the provided default value. Here, the [limit] node is given a default value of 10 if it is not already present or is null.
validators.default:x:@.arguments
   limit:long:10
