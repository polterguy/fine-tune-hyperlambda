// The code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.result] node to the static string "Paid with PayPal". This operation directly assigns the specified string value to the node, effectively updating or initializing its content. The [set-value] slot is crucial for modifying node values in Hyperlambda, allowing for dynamic updates based on the logic or conditions defined elsewhere in the code.
