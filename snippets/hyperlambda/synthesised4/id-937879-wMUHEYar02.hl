// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [whitelist] slot to restrict the execution of certain slots within a defined scope. The [vocabulary] node specifies the slots [return] and [vocabulary] as allowed within the [.lambda] block. Inside the [.lambda] block, a [.foo] node is created and its value is set to "foo" using [set-value]. The [vocabulary] slot is invoked, and the [return] slot is used to return the result of the [.lambda] execution. This setup ensures that only the whitelisted slots can be executed within the [.lambda] block, enhancing security by limiting the operations that can be performed.
