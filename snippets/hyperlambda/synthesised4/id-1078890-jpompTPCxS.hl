/*
 * 1. `@.page-header` - This iterator searches for the first node named "page-header" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy until it finds the node with this name. This is useful when you want to target a specific section or component in a structured document or configuration.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "page-header" node. It allows you to access every child node directly under "page-header", without filtering by name. This is useful when you want to perform operations on or analyze all elements within a specific section.
 * 
 * 3. `h5` - This iterator filters the children nodes retrieved by the `*` iterator to only include those named "h5". This is typically used to target specific HTML elements or nodes within a document structure, such as when you want to extract or manipulate specific headings within a page header.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting or modifying all "h5" headings within a "page-header" section of a web page or document.
 * - Analyzing the content of "h5" nodes for reporting or transformation purposes within a structured document.
