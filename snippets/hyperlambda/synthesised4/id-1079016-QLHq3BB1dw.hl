/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current context. It is often used to access the root node of arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It allows you to access all the arguments passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `data` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "data" from the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target the "data" argument within the set of arguments.
 * 
 * **Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function to access a specific argument named "data" that has been passed to the function. It is useful when you need to manipulate or evaluate the "data" argument within the function's logic.
 * - It can also be used in validation or processing scenarios where the "data" argument needs to be checked or transformed.
