// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [context] slot to store a value on the stack, which can later be retrieved using the [get-context] slot. The [context] slot is used to add an object to the stack with a specified name and value, and the [get-context] slot retrieves this value within a lambda execution. This approach is useful for maintaining data accessibility throughout the execution of a Hyperlambda snippet without passing it as an argument.
