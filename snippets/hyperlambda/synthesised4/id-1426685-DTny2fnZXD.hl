 * This Hyperlambda code is part of a conditional branching structure using the [else] slot. If the preceding conditions in the branching structure evaluate to false, this [else] block will execute. It sets the value of the [@.result] node by replacing occurrences of the string "[[clear_button]]" within its current value with the string "false". 
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes its children if previous conditions are false.
 * 2. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 3. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a specified string within another string.
