/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context with the name "signal". It is useful for accessing specific nodes when you know their names, and it starts the search from the current node's position, moving upwards and across siblings if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the previously found "signal" node. It is useful for accessing all direct descendants of a node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `cached` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved set of nodes to only include those with the name "cached". It is useful for narrowing down the node set to a specific type or category of nodes under the "signal" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to access configuration or state information stored under a "signal" node, specifically targeting nodes named "cached" to perhaps clear or update cached data. 
 * - It could also be used in monitoring or logging systems to retrieve cached signals for analysis or reporting purposes.
