/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any argument nodes that might be present within the "arguments" node.
 * 3. `url` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "url". It is used to specifically target the "url" argument within the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to retrieve the value of a "url" argument passed to it. This is useful in scenarios where you need to process or validate a URL provided as input to a function or endpoint.
