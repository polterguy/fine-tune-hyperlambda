/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the difference between the current date and a birth date is greater than 18 years. It uses [math.subtract] to calculate the age by subtracting the birth date from the current date, and [math.multiply] to represent 18 years in days. If the age is more than 18 years, it returns true. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional check.
 * 2. [mt] - Compares if the first argument is more than the second.
 * 3. [math.subtract] - Calculates the difference between the current date and the birth date.
 * 4. [date.now] - Retrieves the current date and time.
 * 5. [get-value] - Fetches the birth date from a data source.
 * 6. [math.multiply] - Converts 18 years into days.
 * 7. [time] - Represents a time span of 365 days (one year).
 * 8. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 9. [return] - Returns the result of the condition check.
 * 10. [result] - Holds the boolean result of the condition check.
