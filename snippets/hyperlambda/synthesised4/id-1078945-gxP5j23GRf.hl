/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument individually.
 * 
 * 3. `supervised` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "supervised" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target the "supervised" argument.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve the value of a specific argument named "supervised" passed to a Hyperlambda slot or function.
 * - It might be used in a validation step to ensure that a required argument named "supervised" is present and can be accessed for further processing.
