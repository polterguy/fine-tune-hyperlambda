// This Hyperlambda code uses the [validators.mandatory] slot to ensure that the [group_column] node within the [.arguments] node set is provided. If the [group_column] node is missing or has a null value, an exception will be thrown. This is useful for enforcing that a necessary argument is supplied before proceeding with further logic.
