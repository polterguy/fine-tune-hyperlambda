// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] slot to evaluate multiple conditions, specifically checking if the type of a node is equal to a specified type using [type.eq]. The [and] slot requires all its child conditions to evaluate to true for the entire block to be true. Here, [type.eq] is used to compare the type of a node, ensuring it matches the expected type. This setup is useful for type validation in conditional logic.
