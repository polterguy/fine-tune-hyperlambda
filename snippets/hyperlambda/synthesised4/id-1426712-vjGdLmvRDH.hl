/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a signal to a specified session. The signal includes arguments, specifically a boolean argument named [function_waiting] with a value of true. This setup is typically used to notify a particular session that a function is in a waiting state. The [args] node is used to define the arguments that will be transmitted as a JSON string to the subscribers of the signal. 
 * 
 * 1. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal to a specified session.
 * 2. [args] - Contains the arguments to be sent with the signal.
 * 3. [function_waiting] - A boolean argument indicating that a function is waiting.
