// The Hyperlambda code snippet sends a signal to a specific session using the [sockets.signal] slot. It transmits an argument named [finish_reason] to the subscribers of this signal, where the value of [finish_reason] is dynamically retrieved from the current context. This allows for real-time communication with clients connected to the specified session, passing along the reason for finishing an operation or task. The [args] node encapsulates the data being sent as a JSON object to the subscribers.
