// The [unwrap] slot evaluates the expression it points to before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this case, it evaluates the expression [x:+/*], which likely points to a node set, and unwraps their values into the current context. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions inside a lambda object before it is executed.
unwrap:x:+/*
