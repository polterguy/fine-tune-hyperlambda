// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. The [unwrap] slot is used with an expression pointing to the next sibling node, indicated by the "+" iterator. This ensures that the expression is evaluated and its result is available before the execution pointer reaches the node. This technique is useful for forward evaluating expressions inside a lambda object, allowing the result to be used immediately when the node is reached during execution. The [unwrap] slot is particularly handy when dealing with dynamic expressions that need to be resolved before their actual use in the code.
