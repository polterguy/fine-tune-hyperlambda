/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node named [arguments] from the current context. It's often used to access the arguments passed to a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [arguments] node. It is useful when you want to process or evaluate each argument individually.
 * 
 * 3. `hyperlambda`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [hyperlambda] among the children of the [arguments] node. It is used to specifically target the [hyperlambda] argument if it exists.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a dynamic slot or HTTP endpoint to retrieve the value of a specific argument named [hyperlambda] passed to it. This is useful when you want to perform operations or validations specifically on the [hyperlambda] argument.
