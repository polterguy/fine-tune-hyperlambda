// The provided Hyperlambda code uses the [exists] slot to check if there are any child nodes named "references" under the [.arguments] node. If such nodes exist, [exists] evaluates to true; otherwise, it evaluates to false. This is useful for conditionally executing code based on the presence of specific nodes in a node graph.
