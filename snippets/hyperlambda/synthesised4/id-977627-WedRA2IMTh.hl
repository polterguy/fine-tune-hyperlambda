// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to insert a new record into the "orders" table in a database using the [data.create] slot. The [table] slot specifies the target table, while the [values] slot contains the fields and their respective values to be inserted, such as "customer_id" and "total". This approach ensures safe data handling by using SQL parameters, preventing SQL injection attacks.
data.create
   table:orders
   values
      customer_id:42
      total:100.00
