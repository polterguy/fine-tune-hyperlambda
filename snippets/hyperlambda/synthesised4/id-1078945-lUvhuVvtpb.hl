/*
 * 1. `@cache` - This iterator searches for the first node named "cache" in the current context. It is often used to access a specific node directly by its name.
 * 2. `get` - This iterator looks for a child node named "get" under the previously found "cache" node. This is typically used to retrieve or access a specific operation or value associated with the "cache" node.
 * 
 * **Potential use cases:**
 * - Retrieving a cached value or object from a node structure where caching mechanisms are implemented.
 * - Accessing a specific function or method related to cache operations, such as retrieving data from a cache store.
