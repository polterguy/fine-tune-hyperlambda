// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve all child nodes of the [.service2] node. The expression [x:@.service2/*] specifies the path to the target nodes, where [@.service2] refers to the [.service2] node, and [/*] retrieves all its direct children. This operation is useful for accessing or manipulating a specific subset of nodes within a larger graph structure.
get-nodes:x:@.service2/*
