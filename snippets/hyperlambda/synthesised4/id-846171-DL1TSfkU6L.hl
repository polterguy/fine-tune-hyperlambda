/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses the [else] slot to execute a block of code when previous conditions are not met. It sets the value of the [.type] node by concatenating several values: the primary key name, a space, the primary key type, an opening parenthesis, the primary key length, a closing parenthesis, and the string "primary key". The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate these values into a single string, which is then assigned to [.type].
 * 
 * 1. [else] - Executes the block of code when previous conditions are not met.
 * 2. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.type] node.
 * 3. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple values into a single string.
 * 4. [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/pkName] - Retrieves the primary key name.
 * 5. [.] - Represents a static value, in this case, a space.
 * 6. [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/pkType] - Retrieves the primary key type.
 * 7. [.] - Represents a static value, in this case, an opening parenthesis.
 * 8. [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/pkLength] - Retrieves the primary key length.
 * 9. [.] - Represents a static value, in this case, a closing parenthesis followed by "primary key".
