/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.dp` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with this specific name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors if necessary. The `.dp` node is often used in Hyperlambda to refer to a data point or a specific piece of data being processed, typically in loops or iterations.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the `.dp` node is itself a node, and it retrieves this node by reference. This is useful when you want to manipulate or access the original node rather than a copy, allowing for direct modifications.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the node that was de-referenced in the previous step. It is used to access all immediate child nodes of the `.dp` node's value, which is expected to be a node itself.
 * 
 * 4. `stock_status` - This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to only include nodes named `stock_status`. It looks through all the children nodes retrieved by the `*` iterator and selects only those with the name `stock_status`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - The expression could be used in an inventory management system to check the stock status of items. By iterating over data points representing different products, it retrieves the `stock_status` for each product, allowing the system to determine which items are in stock, out of stock, or need to be reordered.
 * - It could also be used in a report generation process where the stock status of various items needs to be compiled and presented, enabling decision-makers to quickly assess inventory levels.
