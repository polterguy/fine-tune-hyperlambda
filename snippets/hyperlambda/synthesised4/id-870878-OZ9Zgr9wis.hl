// This Hyperlambda code snippet dynamically adds nodes to a destination node. It uses [add] to append nodes, where the destination is determined by navigating the node structure using expressions. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves nodes from [.arguments/*/params] to be added to the destination. The code effectively allows for dynamic manipulation of node structures by copying nodes from one part of the graph to another.
