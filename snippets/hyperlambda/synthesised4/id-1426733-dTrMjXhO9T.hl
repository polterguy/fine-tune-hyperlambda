// This Hyperlambda code sends a signal to a specified feedback channel, transmitting a message and a type of "info" as arguments. The feedback channel is dynamically determined from the arguments, and the message content is extracted from the [msg] node. The [sockets.signal] slot is used to facilitate real-time communication, allowing subscribers of the feedback channel to receive the message. The [args] node contains the data to be sent, formatted as JSON.
