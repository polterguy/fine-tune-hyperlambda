/*
 * 1. `@.fields`: This iterator searches for the first node named "fields" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to locate a specific node within a complex structure without knowing its exact position relative to the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the node found by the previous iterator. It is used to access the children of a node once the desired parent node has been located. In this context, it will return all children of the "fields" node, allowing you to perform operations on each of these child nodes.
