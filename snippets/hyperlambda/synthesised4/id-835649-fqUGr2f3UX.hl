// The code uses the [validators.default] slot to ensure that a node named [limit] with a value of type long is present as a child of the [.arguments] node. If the [limit] node does not exist, it will be created with a default value of 10. If the node exists but has a null value, it will be set to 10. This ensures that a default value is always available for the [limit] node.
