/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator is used to retrieve the first node with the name "sql" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches upwards in the hierarchy from the current node, including siblings and their ancestors, until it finds the first matching node named "sql". This is useful when you want to reference a specific node that may be defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure, such as a SQL query or command that has been declared previously and needs to be accessed for further processing or execution. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda script where a SQL query is defined at the beginning of the script, and you need to reference this query later on to execute it or to modify its parameters.
