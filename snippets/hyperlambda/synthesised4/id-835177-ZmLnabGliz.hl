// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced, allowing for forward evaluation. In this example, [unwrap:x:+/*/*/*] evaluates all descendant nodes of the current node's elder sibling, effectively preparing data for subsequent operations by resolving expressions in advance.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*
