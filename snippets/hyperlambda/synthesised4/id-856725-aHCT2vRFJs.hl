// The code snippet uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and forward the expressions in the specified path. It targets the [signal] node, specifically looking for a node with the name "magic.ai.crawl-site" and retrieves the [.type] node within its [.onafter] child node. This allows for dynamic evaluation and extraction of the [.type] node's value from a specific signal structure.
