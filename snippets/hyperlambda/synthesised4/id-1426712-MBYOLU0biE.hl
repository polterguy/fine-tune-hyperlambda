// This Hyperlambda code checks if there is a node named [finish_reason] within the first choice of the JSON converted to a lambda object using [json2lambda]. It uses the [exists] slot to determine the presence of the [finish_reason] node. If the node exists, the [exists] slot will return true, otherwise false. The expression navigates through the lambda structure to locate the specific node.
