// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specific substring within a target string. The [strings.replace] slot is invoked with an expression pointing to the [.result] node, and it replaces occurrences of the substring specified by the [[search]] node with the string "true". This operation is useful for dynamically modifying string content based on variable values or conditions.
strings.replace:x:@.result
   .:[[search]]
