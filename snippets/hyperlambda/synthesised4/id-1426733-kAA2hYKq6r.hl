 * /*
 *  * This Hyperlambda code concatenates a string that includes a dynamic value. It constructs a message indicating the deletion of a certain number of old training snippets with the same URL. The number of snippets is dynamically retrieved using [get-value] from a node path that likely contains a count of these snippets.
 *  * 
 *  * 1. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 *  * 2. [.] - A static string "Deleting ".
 *  * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value from a specified node path, which is expected to be a count.
 *  * 4. [.] - A static string " old training snippets with the same URL".
