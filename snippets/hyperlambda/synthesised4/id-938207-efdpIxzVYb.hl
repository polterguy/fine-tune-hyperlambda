// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [.state] node is not equal to "Open". If the condition is true, it logs an informational message indicating that [.state] is not "Open". The [neq] slot is used for the comparison, and if the condition is met, the [.lambda] block is executed to log the message.
