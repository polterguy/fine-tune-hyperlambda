 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name specified after the `@` symbol. In this case, it looks for the first node named "type" in the current context. It does not traverse siblings but searches within the current hierarchy level. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to fetch a specific configuration or metadata node named "type" within a larger data structure, which might be necessary for determining the type of operation or processing logic to apply in a given context.
