// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to retrieve a limited number of records from a database table named "shipments". By specifying the [limit] argument with a value of 5, it restricts the result set to a maximum of 5 records. This approach helps manage the amount of data retrieved, preventing excessive data load and optimizing performance.
data.read
   table:shipments
   limit:int:5
