/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the node where arguments for a function or slot are specified.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument node that is a direct child of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `aggregate_function` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "aggregate_function" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically target and retrieve the node that defines or holds the value for the "aggregate_function" argument.
