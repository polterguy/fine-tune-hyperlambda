// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement to evaluate a value and execute a corresponding [case] block. The [switch] statement checks the value of [.val], and if it matches "bit", it executes the associated [case] block to perform an action. If no [case] matches, a [default] block can be executed. This structure allows for conditional execution based on the value of [.val].
