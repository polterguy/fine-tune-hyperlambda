/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.dp] from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors and siblings until it finds a match. The [.dp] node is typically used in [for-each] loops to represent the currently iterated node, allowing you to manipulate or access its value or children.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the [.dp] node, assuming that the value of [.dp] is itself a node. It allows you to access the node that is stored as the value of [.dp] by reference, enabling you to modify the original node directly rather than working with a copy. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to update or change the value of the currently iterated node in a loop or similar construct.
