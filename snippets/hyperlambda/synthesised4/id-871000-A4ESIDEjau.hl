// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a join operation between two tables, `ml_types` and `ml_training_snippets`, using a condition that checks for equality between the `type` columns of both tables. The join is specified under a [join] slot, with the condition defined using an [and] slot to ensure both columns are equal. This setup is useful for combining related data from different tables based on matching column values.
