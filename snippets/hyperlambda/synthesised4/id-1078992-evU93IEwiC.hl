/*
 * 1. `@sqlite.select`: This iterator retrieves the first node named `sqlite.select` from the current context. It is used to locate a specific node that likely contains SQL selection logic or query details in a Hyperlambda script.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `sqlite.select` node. It is used to access the details or parameters of the SQL selection, such as fields to select, tables to query, or conditions to apply.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda script to dynamically access and manipulate the parameters of an SQL select operation, allowing for flexible query construction or modification.
 * - It might be used to iterate over and process each parameter or condition of a SQL query, enabling dynamic query generation or validation.
