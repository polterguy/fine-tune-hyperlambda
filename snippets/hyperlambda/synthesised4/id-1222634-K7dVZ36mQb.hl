// Retrieves all [ArtistId] nodes that are children of the node referenced by the value of the [.dp] node. Useful for accessing the [ArtistId] fields within a data segment or variable node, especially when [.dp] holds a reference to a node whose value is another node containing multiple children. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to process or manipulate artist identifiers from a collection of data nodes.
