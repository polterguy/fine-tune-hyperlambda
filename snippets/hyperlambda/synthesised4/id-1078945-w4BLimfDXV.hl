/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "dp" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is used to locate a specific node named "dp" that is an ancestor or sibling of the current node. This is useful when you need to access a node that is not a direct child but is related to the current context.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator, treating it as a node reference. It allows you to work with the node itself rather than just its value. This is particularly useful when the value of a node is another node, and you want to manipulate or access properties of that node directly.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used in a loop or a dynamic slot to access and manipulate the properties of a node that is passed by reference, allowing for operations such as updating or evaluating its children nodes.
