// This code snippet uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a string within the value of the [.original] node. The first argument specifies the string to be replaced, in this case, "2024". The second argument uses [get-value] to retrieve the result of a [math.increment] operation, which will be used as the replacement string.
strings.replace:x:@.original
   :2024
   get-value:x:@math.increment
