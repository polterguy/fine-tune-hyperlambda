// This code snippet checks if a given string does not start with "http://" or "https://". It uses the [and] slot to combine two [not] conditions, each utilizing [strings.starts-with] to verify the absence of these prefixes. If both conditions are true, the overall expression evaluates to true, indicating the string does not begin with either "http://" or "https://".
