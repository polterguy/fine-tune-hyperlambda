/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using the [data.read] slot with SQLite as the database type. 
 * // It selects data from the "Customers" table, applying an aggregate function on the specified column and aliasing the result as "result". 
 * // The query includes a [where] clause with an "and" condition and groups the results by "group_column". 
 * // 1. [database-type] - Specifies the type of database, in this case, SQLite.
 * // 2. [table] - Indicates the table from which to select data, here "Customers".
 * // 3. [columns] - Defines the columns to be selected, including an aggregate function with an alias "result".
 * // 4. [where] - Introduces a condition for filtering results, using an "and" logical operator.
 * // 5. [group] - Specifies the column by which to group the query results, "group_column".
