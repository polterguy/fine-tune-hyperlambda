/*
 * 1. `@strings.split`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "strings.split" in the current context. It is used to locate the specific node where the string splitting operation is defined or executed.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "strings.split" node. It is used to access the individual split parts of the string, assuming that the "strings.split" operation has been executed and its results are stored as child nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access each part of a string that has been split into multiple segments, allowing further processing or analysis of each segment.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where a string needs to be divided into components, such as parsing a CSV line into its individual fields.
