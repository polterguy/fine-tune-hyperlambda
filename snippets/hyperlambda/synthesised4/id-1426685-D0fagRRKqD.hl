/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of a specified string within another string. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first argument is the string or pattern to search for, and the second argument is the string to replace it with. In this example, the code replaces occurrences of the string specified by the [references] node with the string "true" within the string located at the [result] node. The [references] node is used to dynamically determine the string to be replaced.
 * 
 * 1. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a specified string within another string.
 * 2. [@.result] - Points to the node containing the string to be modified.
 * 3. [references] - Specifies the string to be replaced.
 * 4. [true] - The string to replace occurrences of the specified string with.
