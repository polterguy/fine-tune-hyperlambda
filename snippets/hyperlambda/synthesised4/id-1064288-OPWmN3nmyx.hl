/*
 * 1. `@data.read` - This iterator starts by locating the first node with the name "data.read" in the current context. It is used to pinpoint a specific node from which further traversal will begin. This is useful when you have multiple nodes and need to start from a specific one named "data.read".
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node, which in this case is "data.read". It is used to access all direct descendants of the "data.read" node, allowing you to perform operations or extract information from each child node. This is useful when you want to process or analyze all elements contained within a specific parent node.
