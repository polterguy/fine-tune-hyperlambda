// This code uses an [if] statement to check two conditions using the [and] slot: whether [isOnTime] and [isIntact] both evaluate to true. If both conditions are true, it executes the [.lambda] block, which sets the value of [deliveryStatus] to "Delivered successfully". The [get-value] slot is used to retrieve the values of [isOnTime] and [isIntact] for the condition check.
