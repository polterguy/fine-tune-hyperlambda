// The Hyperlambda code changes the name of all nodes referenced by the expression [@data.connect/*/data.execute] to "mssql.execute-batch". The [set-name] slot is used to rename nodes, and in this case, it targets nodes within the [data.connect] hierarchy that match the specified path. This operation is useful for altering node names dynamically based on certain conditions or requirements.
