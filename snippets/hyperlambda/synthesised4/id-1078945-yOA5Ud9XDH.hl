/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate up one level in the hierarchy of the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. In this context, it gets all children of the parent node retrieved by the previous `.` iterator.
 * 
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "signal". It narrows down the selection to nodes specifically named "signal" from the children retrieved by the `*` iterator.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. Here, it gets all children of the "signal" nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `url` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "url". It narrows down the selection to nodes specifically named "url" from the children retrieved by the previous `*` iterator.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract all "url" nodes that are children of "signal" nodes, which are themselves children of the parent node of the current context. This is useful in scenarios where you need to gather all URLs associated with specific signals in a nested data structure.
 * - It can be used in a logging or monitoring system to dynamically retrieve and process URLs related to specific signals for further analysis or reporting.
