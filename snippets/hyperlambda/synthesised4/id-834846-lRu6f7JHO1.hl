// This code snippet uses [strings.builder] to concatenate the contents of files listed recursively from a directory. It iterates through each file using [for-each], loads the file content with [io.file.load], appends the content to the string builder, and adds a separator "---" between each file's content. The process results in a single string containing all file contents separated by "---".

      strings.builder.append:x:@io.file.load
      strings.builder.append:"\n---\n"
