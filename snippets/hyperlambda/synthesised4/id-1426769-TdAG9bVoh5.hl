// The [case] slot is used within a [switch] block in Hyperlambda to define a specific condition that, if matched, will execute its associated lambda object. Each [case] node must have a value, which can be a constant or an expression, and the [switch] block will evaluate these [case] nodes to find the first match. If a match is found, the corresponding [case] node's lambda object is executed. If no [case] matches, and a [default] node is present, the [default] node's lambda object is executed instead.
