// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Orders" and "Employees", using the [join] slot. The join is based on matching the "EmployeeID" column from both tables, with the "Employees" table being aliased as "EmployeeID". The [type] slot specifies the join type as "left", ensuring all records from the "Orders" table are included, even if there are no matching records in the "Employees" table.
join:Employees
   as:EmployeeID
   type:left

      and
