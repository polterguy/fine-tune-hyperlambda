 * // This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.function-result] to the value provided as a child node. The [set-value] slot is used to change the value of a node, and in this case, it targets the node named [.function-result]. The expression [@.function-result] is used to locate the node whose value is to be changed. The new value is provided as a child node to the [set-value] slot.
 * // 
 * // 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node(s) referenced by its expression.
 * // 2. [@.function-result] - Expression pointing to the node whose value will be changed.
