/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "sql" that is before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy to find the matching node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to access a SQL query or command stored in a node named "sql" within the current context. It is useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically execute or manipulate SQL commands that are part of a larger Hyperlambda structure.
