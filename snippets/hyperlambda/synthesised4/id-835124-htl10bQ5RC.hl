// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses [set-value] to change the value of a node referenced by [.dp] to a converted type. The [convert] slot is used to convert the value of the node, with the target type being dynamically determined through a lambda expression that extracts the type from a semantic lambda object. The [hyper2lambda] slot is involved in creating a semantic lambda object from Hyperlambda text, and [get-name] retrieves the name of a node. The code effectively changes the value type of a node based on a dynamically evaluated type.
