// This Hyperlambda code snippet updates the value of the [.result] node by concatenating its current value with the content retrieved from a JSON structure. The JSON structure is accessed using a lambda expression that navigates through the nodes to find the content located at [.json2lambda/*/choices/0/*/delta/*/content]. The [set-value] slot is used to assign the concatenated result back to the [.result] node. The [strings.concat] slot is responsible for combining the values, and the [get-value] slots are used to retrieve the current value of [.result] and the specified content from the JSON structure.
