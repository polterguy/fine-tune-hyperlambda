 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet pauses the execution of the current thread for 10 milliseconds. The [sleep] slot is used to introduce a delay in the execution flow, allowing the thread to be temporarily inactive. This is useful in scenarios where you need to wait for a short period before proceeding with the next operations. The sleep duration is specified in milliseconds as the slot's value.
