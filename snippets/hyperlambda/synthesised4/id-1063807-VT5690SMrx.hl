// 1. `-`: This iterator retrieves the previous node or the node above it in the Hyperlambda structure, also known as the younger sibling. It is useful when you need to reference or manipulate the node that is directly before the current node in the hierarchy. This can be particularly helpful in scenarios where you need to compare or transfer data between adjacent nodes or when implementing logic that depends on the sequence of nodes.
