/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a destination node. The code adds a collection of nodes, each containing a [prompt], [uri], and [distance] node, into the [.result] node's children collection. The values for these nodes are retrieved by referencing the [.dp] node, which is typically used in conjunction with a [for-each] loop to iterate over a set of nodes. The [add] slot allows for dynamic construction of node structures by evaluating and appending the specified nodes to the destination.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the [.result] node.
 * 2. [.] - Indicates a collection of nodes to be added.
 * 3. [prompt] - Retrieves the value of the [prompt] node from the [.dp] node.
 * 4. [uri] - Retrieves the value of the [uri] node from the [.dp] node.
 * 5. [distance] - Retrieves the value of the [distance] node from the [.dp] node.
