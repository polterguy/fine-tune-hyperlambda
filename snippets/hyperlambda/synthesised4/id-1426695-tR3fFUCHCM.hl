// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, [unwrap] is applied to the next sibling node of the current node. This means that any expressions within the sibling node will be evaluated and replaced with their resulting values before the sibling node itself is processed. The use of [unwrap] is particularly useful when you want to forward evaluate expressions in a lambda object, ensuring that the expressions are resolved before the lambda object is executed.
