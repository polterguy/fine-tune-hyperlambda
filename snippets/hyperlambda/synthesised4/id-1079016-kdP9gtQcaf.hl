/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument individually.
 * 
 * 3. `supervised` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "supervised". It is used to specifically target the "supervised" argument within the set of arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to access a specific argument named "supervised" that is passed to it. This might be useful in scenarios where the function needs to perform operations based on the value of the "supervised" argument, such as configuring a machine learning model or toggling a feature in an application.
