// The [unwrap] slot in this code is used to evaluate expressions before the node it references is reached. The expression "x:+/*/**" is dynamically evaluated, allowing the value to be computed and unwrapped before execution continues. This is useful for forward evaluating expressions, ensuring that the node's value is determined in advance.
unwrap:x:+/*/**
