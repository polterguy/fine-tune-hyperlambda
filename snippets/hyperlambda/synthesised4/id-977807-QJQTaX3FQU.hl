// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to select specific columns from a database table using the [data.read] slot. It specifies the table name as "employees" and selects the "first_name", "last_name", and "title" columns. The [limit] slot is used to restrict the result set to only one record. The code effectively constructs an SQL query to retrieve a single row from the specified columns of the "employees" table.
data.read
   table:employees
   columns
      first_name
      last_name
      title
   limit:int:1
