/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to add nodes to a specific location in a Hyperlambda structure. It uses the [add] slot to append nodes obtained from [get-nodes] to the [payload] node within a specified range of nodes under [http.post]. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves nodes based on the expression pointing to the [batch_size] argument. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to a specified location in the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes referenced by the expression, in this case, pointing to [batch_size] under [.arguments].
 * 3. [data.connect] - Part of the expression used to navigate to the desired location within the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 4. [http.post] - Part of the expression indicating the target node for the addition.
 * 5. [payload] - The node to which the retrieved nodes will be added.
 * 6. [.arguments] - The node containing the [batch_size] argument, which is referenced to retrieve nodes.
