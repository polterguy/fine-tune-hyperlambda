/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any arguments that might have been passed as children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `data` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "data". It is used to specifically access the "data" argument if it exists among the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function to access a specific argument named "data" that is passed to the function. It is useful for functions that need to process or manipulate data passed as an argument.
 * - It can also be used in a validation or conditional check to ensure that a "data" argument is present before proceeding with further operations.
