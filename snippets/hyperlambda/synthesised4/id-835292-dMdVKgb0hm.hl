// The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot to evaluate a boolean condition. If the condition evaluates to true, it sets the value of the [type] node to "bool". The [set-value] slot is used to assign this value, showcasing how conditional logic can be applied to dynamically modify node values based on boolean expressions.
