// This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL read operation on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "notes" table. It includes a left join with the "clients" table on the "client_id" field, and selects an aggregated column named "aggregate_functor" with an alias "result". The query applies a "where" condition using "and" logic and limits the result to one record. The [database-type] specifies the database being used, [table] indicates the primary table for the query, [join] defines the join operation with the "clients" table, [columns] specifies the columns to be retrieved, [where] applies filtering conditions, and [limit] restricts the number of returned records.
