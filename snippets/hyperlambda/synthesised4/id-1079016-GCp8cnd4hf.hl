/*
 * 1. `@.invoke`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "invoke" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name, and the `.` before "invoke" specifies that it should start the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you want to directly access a specific node named "invoke" within the current scope, possibly to retrieve its value or to perform operations on it. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to dynamically execute or manipulate a node named "invoke" within a Hyperlambda script, perhaps to trigger a specific action or retrieve its configuration.
