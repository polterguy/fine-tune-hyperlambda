// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before execution, allowing dynamic value assignment. In this example, it evaluates the expression in the node it references, effectively "unwrapping" the value before the node is processed. The [x:+/*] expression indicates it will evaluate all children nodes of the current node's elder sibling.
unwrap:x:+/*
