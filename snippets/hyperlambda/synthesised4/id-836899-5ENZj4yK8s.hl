// The [return-nodes] slot is used to return a collection of nodes from a dynamic slot or a context that explicitly allows returning nodes. In this example, it returns all nodes referenced by the expression [@data.read/*/*], which likely points to a subset of nodes within a data structure, effectively making these nodes the output of the slot or context.
