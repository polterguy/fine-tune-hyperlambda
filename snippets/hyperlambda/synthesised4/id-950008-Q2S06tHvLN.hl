// The code iterates over each file in a recursively listed directory and executes specific Hyperlambda files. It uses [for-each] to loop through files, checking if their paths contain "/magic.startup/" and end with ".hl" using [strings.contains] and [strings.ends-with]. If both conditions are true, [io.file.execute] is used to execute the file.
