// This Hyperlambda code sends a signal using the [sockets.signal] slot to a session identified by the [.session] node. It transmits arguments encapsulated in the [args] node, specifically sending the value of [.finish_reason] as a parameter. This allows the session to receive the signal with the specified finish reason.
