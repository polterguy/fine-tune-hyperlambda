/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] from the current context. The `@` symbol is used to find a node by its name, and it searches through the current node's siblings and ancestors until it finds a match. This is useful in scenarios where you need to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot, as [.arguments] is commonly used to denote input parameters in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is useful when you want to access all the parameters or arguments provided to a function or slot, as it allows you to iterate over each child node under [.arguments].
 * 
 * 3. `limit` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [limit]. It is used to specifically target the [limit] node among the children of [.arguments], which might represent a parameter or setting that controls the extent or amount of data to process or return.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression could be used in a scenario where a function or slot needs to access a specific argument named [limit] to determine how many items to process or return, such as limiting the number of results in a query or pagination context.
