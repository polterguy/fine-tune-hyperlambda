/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot in Hyperlambda to insert a new node into an existing node structure. The [add] slot takes an expression pointing to the destination node set where the new node will be added as a child. In this example, a node named [parameters] is added as a child to all nodes referenced by the expression [@.buffer/*/*]. The [.] node is used to specify the content of the node being added.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts a new node into the node set specified by its expression.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the content of the node being added.
 * 3. [parameters] - The name of the node being added to the destination node set.
