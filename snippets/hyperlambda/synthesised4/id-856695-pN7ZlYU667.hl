/*
 * This Hyperlambda code uses [set-value] to change the value of the [.x] node. It concatenates several strings using [strings.concat], combining a static string, the value obtained from [get-value] which retrieves a node's name, and the result of [get-name] which gets the name of the current node. The code effectively constructs a dynamic string path or expression based on the structure of the nodes it operates on. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.x] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 3. [.] - A static string "--/execute/=".
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a node's name.
 * 5. [.] - A static string "/*/".
 * 6. [get-name] - Gets the name of the current node.
