/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append a new node with a specified value to a collection of nodes. The code adds a node named [primary] with a boolean value of true as a child to each node in the node set referenced by the expression. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends a new node to the node set specified by its expression.
 * 2. [.] - Represents the node to be added.
 * 3. [primary] - The name of the node being added.
 * 4. [bool:true] - The value of the [primary] node, indicating a boolean true value.
