// This Hyperlambda code throws an exception with a message taken from the [.arguments] node, specifically from the [message] child. The exception is marked as public, meaning it will propagate to the client, and the HTTP status code returned to the client is set to 400. This setup is useful for handling errors in a way that informs the client of the issue while specifying a client-visible status code.
