// This Hyperlambda code defines a signal named [magic.ai.html.extract] which is intended to extract information from an HTML input. It takes several arguments: [html] for the HTML content, [url] for resolving relative URLs, [feedback-channel] for any feedback mechanisms, and three boolean arguments [images], [lists], and [code] to specify whether to include images, lists, and code respectively in the extraction process. Each argument is referenced using lambda expressions to ensure they are correctly retrieved from the input data.
