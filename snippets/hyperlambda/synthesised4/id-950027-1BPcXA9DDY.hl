// The code snippet uses the [lt] slot to compare two values. It checks if the value of the node referenced by the expression `@.dp/#` is less than the value obtained from the [get-value] slot pointing to `@.min`. If the condition is true, the [lt] slot will return true.
lt:x:@.dp/#
   get-value:x:@.min
