// The code snippet demonstrates how to concatenate strings using the [strings.concat] slot in Hyperlambda. It retrieves values from two nodes using [get-value], specifically from [.result] and a nested node within [data.select], and combines them with a newline character in between. This operation results in a single string that merges the values from the specified nodes, separated by a newline.
