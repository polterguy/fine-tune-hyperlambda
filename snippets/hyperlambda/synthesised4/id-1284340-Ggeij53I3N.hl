// The expression `unwrap:x:+/*` is used to evaluate and expand all nodes that are direct children of the current node, effectively "unwrapping" them. This is particularly useful when you want to ensure that all expressions within a node are evaluated before proceeding with further operations. In this context, it allows for the dynamic evaluation of nodes, which can be beneficial when dealing with complex data structures or when you need to manipulate or transform data before using it in subsequent operations. This can be especially useful in scenarios where you have a collection of nodes that need to be processed or transformed in a specific way before being returned or used in further computations.
