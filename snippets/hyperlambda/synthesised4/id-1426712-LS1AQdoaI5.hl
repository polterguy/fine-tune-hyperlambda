/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks multiple conditions using the [and] slot. It evaluates to true only if all the following conditions are met: 1) The [exists] slot checks if there is at least one node named "references" under [.arguments]. 2) The [not-null] slot ensures that the "references" node has a non-null value. 3) The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the "references" node. 4) The final [exists] slot checks for the existence of a "snippets" node under [signal]. If all these conditions are true, the entire [and] block evaluates to true.
 * 
 * 1. [exists] - Checks if there is at least one node named "references" under [.arguments].
 * 2. [not-null] - Ensures that the "references" node has a non-null value.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the "references" node.
 * 4. [exists] - Checks for the existence of a "snippets" node under [signal].
