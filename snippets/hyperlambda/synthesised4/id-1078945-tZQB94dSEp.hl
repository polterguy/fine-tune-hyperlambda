/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the tree structure until it finds a node named "session". This is useful when you need to access session-related data that has been defined earlier in the Hyperlambda script, allowing you to reference session variables or configurations that are shared across different parts of the script. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing session variables to maintain state across different parts of a Hyperlambda application.
 * - Retrieving user-specific data stored in a session node for personalized operations or logic.
