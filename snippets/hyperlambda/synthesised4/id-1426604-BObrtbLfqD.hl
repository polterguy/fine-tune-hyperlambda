/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of a [switch] statement to evaluate a variable and execute a corresponding [case] block. The [switch] node evaluates the value of a specified variable, and based on this value, it executes the first matching [case] block. If no [case] block matches, an optional [default] block can be executed. This mechanism is akin to a switch/case construct in traditional programming languages, allowing for conditional execution of code based on specific values.
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Represents a branch in the switch statement that is executed if its value matches the evaluated value of the switch node.
