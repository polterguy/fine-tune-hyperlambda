/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is used to locate the [.arguments] node, which typically contains parameters or arguments passed to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any parameters or arguments that are directly under the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `feedback-channel` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "feedback-channel". It is used to specifically locate and reference the "feedback-channel" node within the children of the [.arguments] node. This node likely contains information or a value related to a feedback channel, which could be used for logging, communication, or other feedback mechanisms.
