/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by finding the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing the arguments section of a Hyperlambda file or endpoint, which typically contains input parameters or configuration settings.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any parameter nodes defined within the "arguments" section, allowing for iteration or further filtering.
 * 
 * 3. `domain` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "domain" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is useful for extracting specific parameters or settings related to a "domain" from the arguments provided to a Hyperlambda file or endpoint.
