/*
 * - `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot.
 * - `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed in.
 * - `recaptcha_response`: This iterator filters the children nodes to find the one named "recaptcha_response". It is used to specifically access the value of the "recaptcha_response" argument.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * 1. Validating a reCAPTCHA response in a web application to ensure the user is not a bot.
 * 2. Accessing the reCAPTCHA response value to send it to a verification service or API for further processing.
