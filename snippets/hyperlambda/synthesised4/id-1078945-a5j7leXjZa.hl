/*
 * 1. `@.no-invocation`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "no-invocation" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name. The dot (`.`) before the name implies that it is looking for a node that is a direct child of the current node or context.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to check if a specific node named "no-invocation" exists within the current context, which might be useful in scenarios where the presence or absence of this node determines subsequent logic or actions.
