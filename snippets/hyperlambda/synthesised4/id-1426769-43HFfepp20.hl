// This Hyperlambda code constructs a connection string by concatenating the values of [connection-string] and [database] from the [.arguments] node, separated by a "|", and assigns this concatenated string to the [.connection] node. The [set-value] slot is used to set the value, and [strings.concat] is used to concatenate the strings. The result is a formatted connection string enclosed in square brackets.
