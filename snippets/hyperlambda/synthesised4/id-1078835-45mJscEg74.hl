/*
 * 1. `@.prop`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node with the name "prop" in the current context. It looks for a node named "prop" at the same level or higher in the hierarchy, starting from the current node's position.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: Once the "prop" node is found, this iterator retrieves all its children nodes. It expands the search to include every direct child of the "prop" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access and manipulate all child nodes of a specific "prop" node in a Hyperlambda structure. For example, if "prop" represents a configuration or settings node, this expression could be used to iterate over and modify each setting.
 * - It could also be useful in scenarios where you need to validate or log information about each child node under a "prop" node, such as checking for required fields or logging their values for debugging purposes.
