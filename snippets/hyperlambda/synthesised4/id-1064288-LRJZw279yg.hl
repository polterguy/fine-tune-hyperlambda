/*
 * 1. `@data.connect`: This iterator searches for the first node named "data.connect" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "data.connect" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing for further traversal or operations on these children nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `data.read`: This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to only include nodes named "data.read". It is used to narrow down the selection to specific nodes of interest, based on their name, within the children of the "data.connect" node.
