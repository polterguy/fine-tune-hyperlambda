/*
 * 1. `@.return` - This iterator looks for the first node named "return" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for the first occurrence of a node with this specific name, starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "return" node. It expands the search to include every child node directly under the "return" node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to gather all child nodes of a "return" node in a Hyperlambda structure. It might be useful in scenarios where you need to process or evaluate all the children of a "return" node, such as collecting results or values that are meant to be returned from a function or a process.
