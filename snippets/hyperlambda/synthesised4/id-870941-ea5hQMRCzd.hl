/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds nodes to a specified location. It uses [add] to insert nodes at the path "./*/return", and [get-nodes] to retrieve nodes from the result of an [execute-file] operation. The [get-nodes] slot fetches nodes referenced by its expression, and the [add] slot places these nodes at the specified destination. This operation effectively appends the nodes returned from executing a file to the "return" node. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Inserts nodes at the specified location.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the result of an [execute-file] operation.
