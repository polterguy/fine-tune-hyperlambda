/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to navigate to the top of the node hierarchy, allowing access to the entire structure from the root.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children nodes of the root node.
 * 
 * 3. `http.post` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "http.post". It is used to find nodes related to HTTP POST operations.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "http.post" nodes. It is used to access the details or configurations related to the HTTP POST operation.
 * 
 * 5. `payload` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "payload". It is used to find the specific node that contains the payload data for the HTTP POST request.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract or manipulate the payload data from an HTTP POST request within a Hyperlambda application.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to log, modify, or validate the payload of HTTP POST requests processed by the application.
