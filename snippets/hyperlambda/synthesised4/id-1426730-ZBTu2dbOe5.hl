/*
 * This Hyperlambda code takes a string, splits it into multiple parts using a delimiter, and then joins a subset of these parts back into a single string with a different delimiter. Specifically, it retrieves the value of a node, splits it into components, selects a subset of these components, and joins them back together using a colon as the separator. The result is then set as the value of a specified node.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.join] - Concatenates a list of strings with a specified separator.
 * 3. [strings.split] - Splits a string into multiple parts based on a delimiter.
 * 4. [1,100] - Selects a subset of the split string's components.
 * 5. [.] - Specifies the colon character as the separator for joining strings.
