/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "signal" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node by name within the current node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "signal" node. It is used to access the entire set of child nodes under "signal".
 * 
 * 3. `snippets` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to only include those named "snippets". It is used to narrow down the node set to nodes specifically named "snippets".
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "snippets" node. It is used to access the entire set of child nodes under "snippets".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract or manipulate all nodes under a "snippets" node, which is itself a child of a "signal" node. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze code snippets or data segments organized under a "signal" node.
