/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to navigate to the top of the node hierarchy from the current position. This is useful when you need to access nodes or data that are defined at the root level of the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all child nodes of the root node. This is often used when you want to perform operations on or analyze all nodes at a certain level in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 3. `pgsql.connect` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to only include those named `pgsql.connect`. It is used to specifically target nodes related to PostgreSQL connection operations, which might be part of a database interaction setup.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. Here, it is used to access all child nodes of the `pgsql.connect` nodes, potentially representing various connection parameters or configurations.
 * 
 * 5. `return-nodes` - This final iterator filters the nodes to only include those named `return-nodes`. It is likely used to find nodes that are responsible for returning data or results from the PostgreSQL connection operation.
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression might include setting up a database connection and retrieving the results or status of that connection operation. It could be part of a larger workflow where database connectivity is established, and the results are processed or logged.
