/*
 * 1. `@.snippets`: This iterator retrieves the first node named "snippets" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy to find the node. This is useful for accessing a specific section or collection of data that is organized under a "snippets" node.
 * 
 * 2. `0`: This iterator retrieves the first child of the previous result set, which in this case is the "snippets" node. It is used to access the first snippet in a list or collection of snippets.
 * 
 * 3. `-`: This iterator retrieves the younger sibling of the previous result set, which means it moves to the node immediately before the current node in the hierarchy. This is useful for accessing related nodes that are organized sequentially.
 * 
 * 4. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is used to access all the nodes that are direct children of the current node, allowing for operations on multiple nodes at once.
 * 
 * 5. `completion`: This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes named "completion". It is used to focus on specific nodes within a larger set, particularly when looking for nodes that represent a completion or final result.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * 
 * - Accessing a specific completion result from a list of code snippets, where each snippet has a completion node.
 * - Navigating a hierarchical data structure to retrieve and process completion data associated with a particular snippet or sequence of nodes.
