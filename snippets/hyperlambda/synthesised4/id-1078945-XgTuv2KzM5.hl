/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `.dp` in the current context. The `@` symbol is used to find the node by its name. The `.dp` node is often used in Hyperlambda to represent the "data pointer" in loops, such as in a [for-each] loop, where it points to the current node being iterated over.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found in the previous step. It assumes that the value of the `.dp` node is itself a reference to another node, and this iterator retrieves that node by reference. This allows you to work with the actual node being pointed to, rather than just a copy of its value.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression is commonly used in loops, particularly with the [for-each] slot, to access and manipulate the current node being iterated over. By de-referencing the `.dp` node, you can directly modify the node's value or its children nodes within the loop.
