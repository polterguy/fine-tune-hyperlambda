/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current context. It is used to locate the node that contains the arguments for a function or operation. This is useful when you need to access the parameters passed to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument node within the "arguments" node. This allows you to iterate over or manipulate each argument individually.
 * 
 * 3. `type`: This iterator filters the result to only include nodes with the name "type" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically access the "type" argument, which might be used to determine the type of operation or data being processed.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used in a function or slot to dynamically determine the type of an argument passed to it, allowing for conditional logic or processing based on the type of data received.
