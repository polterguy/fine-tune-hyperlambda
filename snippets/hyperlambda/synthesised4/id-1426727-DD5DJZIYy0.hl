// This Hyperlambda code sends a signal to a feedback channel using the [sockets.signal] slot. It constructs a message by concatenating strings and specifies the message type as "info". The signal is sent to the channel specified by the [feedback-channel] node within the [.arguments] node, and the message is passed as JSON to subscribers.
