/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate upwards in the hierarchy to access the node that contains the current node as a child.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node returned by the previous iterator. It is used to access every child node of the parent node.
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "signal". It is used to find specific nodes among the children that match the given name.
 * 
 * This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to access all "signal" nodes that are direct children of the parent node of the current context. For example, it could be used in a signal processing system to gather all signal-related data nodes for further processing or analysis.
