// This Hyperlambda code snippet appends a semicolon and a space to the existing value of the [.sql] node, followed by the value of the [.tail] node. It uses [strings.concat] to concatenate these values, and [set-value] to update the [.sql] node with the resulting string. This is useful for constructing SQL queries or commands by dynamically appending additional segments.
