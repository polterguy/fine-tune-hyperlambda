/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access the individual argument nodes that are passed as children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `subject`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `subject`. It is used to specifically target the `subject` argument from the list of arguments, assuming such a node exists among the children of `.arguments`.
