/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is useful when you want to start your expression from the top of the node hierarchy, regardless of where the current node is located.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children nodes of the root node.
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "signal" from the previously retrieved children nodes of the root.
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current "signal" nodes.
 * 5. `username` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "username" from the previously retrieved children nodes of the "signal" nodes.
 * 
 * This expression is used to navigate from the root node to find all "username" nodes that are children of "signal" nodes, which in turn are children of the root node. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to extract or manipulate user-related data encapsulated within a "signal" structure in a Hyperlambda graph.
