/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [arguments] that is an ancestor of the current node. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot within a Hyperlambda file or dynamic slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [arguments] node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of the [arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `connectionString` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name [connectionString]. It is used to specifically target the [connectionString] node among the children of the [arguments] node. 
 * 
 * This expression is useful for accessing a specific argument, [connectionString], that has been passed to a Hyperlambda slot or function, allowing the developer to retrieve and use its value within the Hyperlambda code.
