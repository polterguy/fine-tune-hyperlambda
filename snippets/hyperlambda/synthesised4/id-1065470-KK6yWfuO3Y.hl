/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" from the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name.
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is another node itself, and it retrieves this node by reference. This allows for modifications to the original node, not just a copy of it. 
 * 
 * Use case: This expression is typically used in a [for-each] loop where ".dp" represents the currently iterated node, allowing you to access and modify the node's value directly.
