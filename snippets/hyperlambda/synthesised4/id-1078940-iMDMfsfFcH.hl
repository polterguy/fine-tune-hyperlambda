/*
 * 1. `@.file-data` - This iterator starts by selecting the first node with the name "file-data" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node within the current graph structure.
 * 
 * 2. `0` - This iterator selects the first child node of the previously selected "file-data" node. It is used to narrow down to a specific child node, which is the first in order.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the previously selected node. It is used to access all nodes directly under the selected node, allowing for further filtering or operations.
 * 
 * 4. `"@.arguments/*/prompt"` - This is an extrapolated expression that will be evaluated to replace itself with the value of the node it points to. It looks for a node named "prompt" within the children of the "arguments" node. This part is used to dynamically select a node based on the value of "prompt" within the current execution context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a scenario where you need to dynamically access and process data from a file structure based on a user-provided prompt. For instance, in a file processing system where the prompt determines which specific data segment to retrieve and manipulate.
 * - It could also be used in a templating system where parts of the template are dynamically selected based on user input or other runtime conditions.
