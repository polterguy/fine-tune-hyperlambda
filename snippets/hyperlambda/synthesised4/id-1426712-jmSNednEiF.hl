/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if there are any child nodes under the [result] node of an [execute] node. If such nodes exist, it concatenates and sets a new prompt message in the [.new-prompt] node, detailing the response from a workflow execution, formatted as a JSON string. It also updates the [.function-result] node by appending the JSON representation of the result. The code uses [strings.concat] to build the strings and [set-value] to assign them to the respective nodes.
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if there are any child nodes under the [result] node of an [execute] node.
 * 2. [exists] - Evaluates whether the specified node set exists.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the [if] condition is true.
 * 4. [set-value] - Assigns a new value to a specified node.
 * 5. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 6. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a specified node.
 * 7. [get-value:x:@execute/*/workflow] - Retrieves the workflow name from the [execute] node.
 * 8. [get-value:x:@lambda2json] - Retrieves the JSON representation of the result.
 * 9. [.new-prompt] - Node where the concatenated prompt message is stored.
 * 10. [.function-result] - Node where the concatenated function result is stored.
