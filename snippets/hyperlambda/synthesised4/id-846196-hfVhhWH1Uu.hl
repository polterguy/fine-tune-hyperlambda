// This Hyperlambda code checks if a "session" node exists and is not null within the ".arguments" node. The [and] slot ensures both conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. The [exists] slot checks for the presence of the "session" node, while [not-null] verifies that it has a non-null value.
