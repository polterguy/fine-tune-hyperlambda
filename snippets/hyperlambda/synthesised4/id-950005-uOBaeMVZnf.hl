// The code demonstrates the use of [strings.builder] to construct a string by iterating over all nodes named "foo" within the [.data] node. For each "foo" node found, [strings.builder.append] is used to append its value to the string being built. This process effectively concatenates the values of all "foo" nodes under [.data] into a single string.
