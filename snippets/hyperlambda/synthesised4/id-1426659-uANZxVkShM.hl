/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a string does not start with "https://". It uses the [not] slot to logically invert the result of the [strings.starts-with] slot, which evaluates whether the string specified by the lambda expression "@.dp/#/*/\@src/[0,1]" begins with "https://". If the string does not start with "https://", the [not] slot will return true. 
 * 
 * 1. [not] - Inverts the result of its child condition.
 * 2. [strings.starts-with] - Evaluates if the specified string starts with "https://".
 * 3. [x:"@.dp/#/*/\@src/[0,1]"] - Lambda expression pointing to the string being evaluated.
 * 4. [.:https://] - The sequence of characters to check for at the start of the string.
