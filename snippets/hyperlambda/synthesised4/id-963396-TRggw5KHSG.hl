// The provided Hyperlambda code connects to a PostgreSQL database named "audit" and executes a SQL command to delete records from the "logs" table where the "created_at" timestamp is older than 90 days. The [pgsql.connect] slot establishes the database connection, while the [pgsql.execute] slot runs the SQL deletion command.
pgsql.connect:audit
   pgsql.execute:"delete from logs where created_at < now() - interval '90 days'"
