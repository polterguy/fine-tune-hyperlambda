/*
 * The code snippet uses the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate a list of strings into one string. It combines a static string "![", the first non-null value from the [get-first-value] operation, a static string "](", the value retrieved from [get-value] pointing to [.url], and a closing parenthesis ")". The [get-first-value] operation retrieves the first non-null value from the specified expression, which involves accessing a node's value through a complex expression. This code is likely constructing a Markdown image link, where the alt text is dynamically determined and the URL is retrieved from a node. 
 * 
 * 1. [strings.concat] - Concatenates a list of strings into one string.
 * 2. [.] - Static string "![", used as the opening of a Markdown image link.
 * 3. [get-first-value] - Retrieves the first non-null value from its children nodes or expression.
 * 4. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of a node specified by its expression.
 * 5. [.] - Static string "](", used as part of the Markdown image link syntax.
 * 6. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [.url] node.
 * 7. [.] - Static string ")", used as the closing of a Markdown image link.
