/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current position in the hierarchy. It is used to access the [.arguments] node, which is typically the starting point for accessing arguments passed into a function or endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of [.arguments].
 * 
 * 3. `url` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "url" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically access the "url" argument node, assuming it is a child of [.arguments].
