/*
 * The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to dynamically add nodes into a destination node. It uses the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by [get-nodes] from a specified path within [.arguments]. The [add] slot's expression points to the elder sibling of the current node, and [get-nodes] fetches nodes from the [.arguments] node's children with the name "type".
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Appends nodes to the elder sibling of the current node.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node's children with the name "type".
