// The code demonstrates the use of logical operators [and] and [or] to evaluate conditions. The [and] slot requires all its child conditions to be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true, while the [or] slot requires only one of its child conditions to be true. The [filename.neq] is used to check if a filename is not equal to a specified value, contributing to the logical evaluation.
