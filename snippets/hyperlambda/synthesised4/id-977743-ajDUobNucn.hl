// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to insert a new record into the "customers" table using the [data.create] slot. The [table] slot specifies the target table, while the [values] slot contains the fields and their corresponding values to be inserted, such as "name" and "org_no". The code ensures safe insertion by using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
