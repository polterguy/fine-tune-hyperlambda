/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add a new node to a specific location in a node structure. 
 * // The [add] slot is used to insert a new node at a specified position within the node hierarchy. 
 * // The expression in [add] determines the exact position where the new node will be inserted. 
 * // The new node being added has a child node with a name of [completion] and its value is set to the value of the node referenced by the expression in [completion].
 * // 1. [add] - Inserts a new node at the specified position in the node hierarchy.
 * // 2. [.] - Represents the new node being added.
 * // 3. [completion] - Sets the value of the new node to the value of the node referenced by the expression in [completion].
