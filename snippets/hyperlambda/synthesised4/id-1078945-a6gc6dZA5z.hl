/*
 * 1. `@.outgoing`: This iterator looks for the first node named "outgoing" that is an ancestor of the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve configuration or state information stored in an "outgoing" node that is part of a larger hierarchical structure, such as a network request or response object.
 * - It can also be used to access metadata or settings that are shared across multiple nodes within a larger workflow or process.
