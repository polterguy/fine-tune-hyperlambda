 * The code checks if an HTTP POST request's status code is not between 200 and 299. If the condition is true, it converts the HTTP POST response to a Hyperlambda string and logs an error message with details about the error, including the error message, status, and the converted Hyperlambda string. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional statement.
 * 2. [not] - Inverts the condition of its child nodes.
 * 3. [and] - Combines multiple conditions that must all be true.
 * 4. [mte] - Checks if the HTTP POST status code is more than or equal to 200.
 * 5. [lt] - Checks if the HTTP POST status code is less than 300.
 * 6. [.lambda] - Executes the following block if the condition is true.
 * 7. [lambda2hyper] - Converts the HTTP POST response to a Hyperlambda string.
 * 8. [log.error] - Logs an error message with details about the HTTP POST request failure.
