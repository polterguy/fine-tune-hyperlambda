// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [return-nodes] slot to return a set of nodes from a dynamically created slot. The nodes returned include [user-id] with an integer value of 12345, [username] with the value "JohnDoe", and [status] with the value "Active". This structure is used to return multiple pieces of related data as a single response from a slot.
