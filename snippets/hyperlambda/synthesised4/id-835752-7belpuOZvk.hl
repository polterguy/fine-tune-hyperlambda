// The Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to perform a SQL read operation on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "Patients" table. It specifies columns to retrieve, including an aggregate function with an alias "result". The code includes a [where] clause with an [and] condition and groups the results by a specified column. The slots used are: [data.read] for initiating the read operation, [database-type] to specify SQLite, [table] to select the "Patients" table, [columns] to define the columns and aggregate function, [where] for conditions, and [group] to group results by a column.
