// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [else-if] slot to check if the value retrieved by [get-value] from the [.value] node is equal to 2 using the [eq] slot. If the condition is true, it executes the [.lambda] block, which sets the [.result] node's value to "Value is 2" using the [set-value] slot.
