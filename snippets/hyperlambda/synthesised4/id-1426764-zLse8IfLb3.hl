/*
 * This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the [.type] node to "decimal". It uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.type] node to a static string value "decimal". 
 * 
 * 1. [case:dec] - Represents a case block, possibly part of a switch statement.
 * 2. [set-value:x:@.type] - Changes the value of the node referenced by the expression to the value provided by its child node.
 * 3. [.:decimal] - The static value "decimal" that is assigned to the [.type] node.
