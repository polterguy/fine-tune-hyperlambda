/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to add a new node to the [.snippets] node. It creates a nested structure where the [prompt] node retrieves its value from a specific path in the current data structure, specifically the content of the first choice's message in an HTTP POST response. The [completion] node is then set to the value of [.content]. This setup is typically used for organizing and storing prompt-completion pairs, which can be useful in applications involving AI or machine learning models that generate responses based on input prompts. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node to the [.snippets] node.
 * 2. [.] - Represents a new node under [.snippets].
 * 3. [.] - Represents a nested node under the previous node.
 * 4. [prompt] - Retrieves its value from the specified path in the HTTP POST response.
 * 5. [completion] - Sets its value to the value of [.content].
