/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.dp` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and `.dp` suggests it's looking for a node with this specific name, typically used to denote a data point or a specific data segment in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the `.dp` node. It assumes that the value of the `.dp` node is another node itself, allowing access to this node by reference. This is useful when you want to manipulate or access the original node rather than a copy.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously referenced node. In this context, it will access all children of the node that is the value of the `.dp` node.
 * 
 * 4. `auth` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `auth`. It looks for nodes among the children of the node referenced by the `#` iterator that have the name `auth`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a context where you need to access authentication-related data within a data structure, such as retrieving authentication tokens or credentials stored under a `.dp` node.
 * - It might be utilized in a security module to verify or manipulate authentication details dynamically during execution.
