// The [unwrap] slot in this Hyperlambda code is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. The expression "x:+/*/*" will be evaluated, and the result will replace the node's value where [unwrap] is used. This allows for forward evaluation of expressions within the lambda object.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
