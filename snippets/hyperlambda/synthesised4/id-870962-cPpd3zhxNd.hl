// The code uses the [not-null] slot to check if the node specified by the expression `@.key` exists and has a non-null value. If the node is present and contains a value, the [not-null] slot will evaluate to true; otherwise, it will return false. This is useful for validating the presence and value of a node within a Hyperlambda graph.
