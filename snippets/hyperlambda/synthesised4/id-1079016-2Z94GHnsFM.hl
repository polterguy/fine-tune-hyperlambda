/*
 * 1. `@json2lambda`: This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context with the name "json2lambda". It is typically used to locate a specific node within a larger structure, often at the root or a higher level in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the previously selected "json2lambda" node. It is used to access any direct children of the "json2lambda" node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `message`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved child nodes to include only those with the name "message". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes specifically named "message".
 * 
 * 4. `*`: This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the previously selected "message" node. It is used to access any direct children of the "message" node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 5. `content`: This iterator filters the previously retrieved child nodes to include only those with the name "content". It is used to narrow down the selection to nodes specifically named "content".
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting the "content" of messages from a JSON structure that has been converted into a Hyperlambda node structure, where each message is nested under a "json2lambda" node.
 * - Accessing specific content within a messaging system or API response that uses a similar hierarchical structure for organizing message data.
