// This Hyperlambda code uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the [.type] node to the string "string". The [set-value] slot modifies the value of the node specified by its expression to the value provided in its child node. The expression [@.type] points to the [.type] node, and the child node [.:"string"] provides the new value.
