/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet concatenates the current value of the [.anchor] node with a space and the value of the node referenced by [.dp], then updates the [.anchor] node with this new concatenated string.
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of the node specified by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates a list of strings into one string.
 * 3. [get-value] (first occurrence) - Retrieves the current value of the [.anchor] node.
 * 4. [.] - Represents a static space character to be included in the concatenation.
 * 5. [get-value] (second occurrence) - Retrieves the value of the node referenced by [.dp] and de-references it.
