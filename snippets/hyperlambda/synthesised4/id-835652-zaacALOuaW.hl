// The code snippet uses the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the [aggregate_column] argument is one of the specified valid values. It lists acceptable column names, such as "activities.activity_id" and "client_id.name", and will throw an exception if the provided argument does not match any of these values. This is useful for validating input to ensure only predefined columns are used in operations.
