// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [eq] slot to compare two values. It retrieves the value of a node using [get-value] with a lambda expression pointing to a specific node path, and compares it to a static value provided as a child node. The [eq] slot returns true if the values are exactly the same. The expression in [get-value] navigates to a node named [content] which is a child of the previous sibling of the [.foo] node.
