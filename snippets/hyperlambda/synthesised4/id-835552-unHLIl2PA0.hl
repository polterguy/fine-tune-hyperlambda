/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-name] slot to change the names of all nodes referenced by its expression to a new name derived from the value of a specified node. It retrieves the new name from the [group_column] node within the [.arguments] node and applies it to all nodes two levels down from the current node. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the names of the nodes referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [group_column] node within the [.arguments] node to use as the new name.
