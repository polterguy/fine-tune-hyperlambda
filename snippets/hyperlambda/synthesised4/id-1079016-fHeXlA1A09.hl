/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any arguments that might be passed as children to the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `references` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "references". It is used to specifically access the "references" argument if it exists among the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * 
 * - This expression can be used in a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint to access a specific argument named "references" that is passed to the slot or endpoint. It allows the developer to easily retrieve and manipulate this argument within their Hyperlambda code.
 * - It can be used in validation logic to ensure that a "references" argument is present and to perform operations based on its value.
