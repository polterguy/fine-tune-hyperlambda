/*
 * 1. `@.fixed`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "fixed" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for the node by name, starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name that might not be a direct child of the current node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to retrieve a configuration or fixed value node that is defined higher up in the hierarchy or among sibling nodes, ensuring that you get the correct node even if there are multiple nodes with similar names at different levels.
