// The [lambda2hyper] slot converts a specified lambda object into a Hyperlambda string representation. In this example, it takes the lambda object resulting from the [http.post] invocation and transforms it into a Hyperlambda string. This allows for easy transfer or storage of the lambda object in a textual format. The [x:@http.post] expression points to the result of the [http.post] slot, ensuring that the correct lambda object is being converted.
lambda2hyper:x:@http.post
