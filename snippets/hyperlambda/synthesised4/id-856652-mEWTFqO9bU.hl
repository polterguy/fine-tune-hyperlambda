// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of a node specified by a complex expression. It starts by referencing the current node using [.dp], then de-references its value with [#], navigates through its children with [*], and finally accesses a specific child named [path]. The result is the value of the [path] node, effectively extracting nested data from a structured node graph.
