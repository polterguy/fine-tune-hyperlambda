/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to dynamically add nodes into a destination node's children collection using the [add] slot. The [add] slot takes an expression pointing to the destination nodes as its main argument, and appends the result of the [get-nodes] invocation to these nodes. Specifically, it retrieves nodes from the [.disallow] node and adds them to the children collection of the destination nodes specified by the expression in [add]. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds nodes to the destination node's children collection.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the specified [.disallow] node.
