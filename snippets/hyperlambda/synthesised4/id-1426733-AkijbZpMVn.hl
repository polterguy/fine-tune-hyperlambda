/*
 * The provided Hyperlambda code checks if the value of [.already-exists] is greater than 0. If true, it concatenates a message indicating that snippets already exist in the database and were not imported. This message is then sent through a specified feedback channel using sockets, with the message type set to "info". Finally, the code sleeps for 100 milliseconds before proceeding. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks if the condition is true.
 * 2. [mt] - Compares if [.already-exists] is more than 0.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Executes the following code block if the condition is true.
 * 4. [strings.concat] - Concatenates the value of [.already-exists] with a static message.
 * 5. [unwrap] - Evaluates all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied.
 * 6. [sockets.signal] - Sends a signal with a message to a feedback channel.
 * 7. [args] - Contains the arguments for the signal.
 * 8. [message] - The concatenated message to be sent.
 * 9. [type] - Specifies the type of message as "info".
 * 10. [sleep] - Pauses execution for 100 milliseconds.
