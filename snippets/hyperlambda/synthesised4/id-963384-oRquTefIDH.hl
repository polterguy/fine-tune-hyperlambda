// The Hyperlambda code deletes records from the "products" table in a MySQL database where the stock is equal to 0 and the product is marked as discontinued. The [mysql.delete] slot specifies the table and conditions for deletion using the [where] clause, which combines conditions with [and] to ensure both conditions are met.
