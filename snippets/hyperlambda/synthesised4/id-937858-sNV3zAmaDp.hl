// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of an [if] statement combined with an [or] logical operator to evaluate two conditions. The [or] slot checks if either of the two [eq] conditions are true, where each [eq] slot compares the result of an expression to a specified value. If either condition is met, the [.lambda] block is executed. The [.lambda] block contains the actions to be performed when the [if] condition evaluates to true.
