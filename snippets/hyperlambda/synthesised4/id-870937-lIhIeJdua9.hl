// The code snippet demonstrates the usage of the [else] slot to execute a block of code when all preceding [if] and [else-if] conditions evaluate to false. In this case, it uses the [add] slot to append a node with a boolean value to all [return-nodes] in the current context. The [else] block directly contains its executable code without a [.lambda] wrapper, as it does not require a condition to be true to execute.
