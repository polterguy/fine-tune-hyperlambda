/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [fork] slot to execute a lambda object in a separate thread. The [eval] slot is used to invoke the lambda object referenced by the [.invoke] node. This allows the lambda object to be executed concurrently, without blocking the main execution flow. 
 * 
 * 1. [fork] - Initiates a new thread of execution for the lambda object.
 * 2. [eval:x:@.invoke] - Executes the lambda object referenced by the [.invoke] node within the new thread.
