// The code demonstrates a [while] loop that continues executing as long as the value of [.no] is less than 20. Within each iteration, it logs a message "Howdy from while loop" and increments the value of [.no] by 1 using [math.increment]. The loop effectively iterates 20 times, logging the message and updating [.no] each time.
while
   lt:x:@.no
      .:int:20
   .lambda
      log.info:Howdy from while loop
      math.increment:x:@.no
