// The Hyperlambda code performs a SQL read operation on a SQLite database, targeting the "users" table. It selects an aggregated column, aliasing it as "result", and applies a "group by" operation on "group_column". The [where] clause is initialized with an [and] condition, allowing for further filtering criteria to be added.
