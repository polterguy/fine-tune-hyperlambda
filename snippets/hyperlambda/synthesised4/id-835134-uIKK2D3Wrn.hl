 * The code checks if there are no child nodes under [paths] within the [result] node. If this condition is true, it removes the [paths] node from [result]. This ensures that [paths] is only present if it contains children nodes. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Evaluates a condition and executes its lambda object if true.
 * 2. [not-exists] - Checks if the specified node set is empty.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 4. [remove-nodes] - Removes the specified nodes from the structure.
