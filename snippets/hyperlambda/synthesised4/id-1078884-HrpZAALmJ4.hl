/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator looks for the first node named "arguments" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards in the hierarchy until it finds the node with the specified name.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It allows access to any node directly under the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `age` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "age" among the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to access the "age" parameter from a set of arguments passed to a function or an endpoint. It allows for dynamic retrieval of the "age" value, which can then be used for further processing or validation.
