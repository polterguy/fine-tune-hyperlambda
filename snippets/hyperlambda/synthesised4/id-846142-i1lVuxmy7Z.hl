// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [get-nodes] slot in Hyperlambda. It retrieves all child nodes of the [.snippets] node. The expression [x:@.snippets/*] specifies the path to these child nodes, allowing you to access or manipulate them further in your Hyperlambda script. This is useful for iterating over or processing multiple nodes within a parent node.
get-nodes:x:@.snippets/*
