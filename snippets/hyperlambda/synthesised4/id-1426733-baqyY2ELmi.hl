/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [get-count] slot to count the number of child nodes under a specified node. The expression provided to [get-count] points to the children of the [.snippets] node, and the result will be the total number of these child nodes. This is useful for determining the size of a node collection within a Hyperlambda structure.
 * // 1. [.snippets] - A node that potentially contains multiple child nodes.
 * // 2. [get-count] - A slot that calculates and returns the number of child nodes under the [.snippets] node.
