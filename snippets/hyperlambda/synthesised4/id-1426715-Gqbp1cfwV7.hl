 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the [auth] node within the [model] node is not null and not equal to an empty value. If both conditions are true, the [and] slot will evaluate to true. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Combines multiple conditions and evaluates to true only if all conditions are true.
 * 2. [not-null] - Checks if the [auth] node within the [model] node is not null.
 * 3. [neq] - Checks if the [auth] node within the [model] node is not equal to an empty value.
