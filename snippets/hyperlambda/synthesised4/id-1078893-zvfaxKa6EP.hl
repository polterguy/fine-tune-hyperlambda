 * 1. `@io.folder.list`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "io.folder.list" from the current context. This is typically used to access a node that contains information or operations related to listing folders, such as a node that might contain metadata or configuration settings for a folder listing operation.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "io.folder.list" node. This is useful for accessing all elements or items that are part of the folder listing, such as individual folder names or properties associated with each folder.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to process or display a list of folders retrieved from a directory. By accessing all children of the "io.folder.list" node, you can iterate over each folder and perform operations such as displaying their names, checking their properties, or applying filters.
