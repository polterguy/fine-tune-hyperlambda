// The Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [fork] slot to execute the [io.file.read] operation in a separate thread. This allows the reading of the "security.log" file from the "/var/logs" directory to occur asynchronously, without blocking the main execution flow. This approach is useful for performing file operations in parallel, improving efficiency when handling multiple tasks.
fork
