// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.create] slot to insert a new record into a database table named "hyperlambda". It specifies the table name and uses the [values] node to define the data to be inserted. The [prompt] and [code] fields are populated using the [strings.split] slot, which splits a string into parts, while the [is_static] field is set to an integer value of 1. This setup is useful for dynamically inserting data into a database while ensuring specific fields are populated with processed values.
