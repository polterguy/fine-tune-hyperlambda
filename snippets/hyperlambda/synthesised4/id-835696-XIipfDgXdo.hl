// The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [remove-nodes] slot to delete specific nodes. It targets nodes within the [.arguments] node that match the expression, specifically removing all nodes named "group_column" that are children of [.arguments]. This operation is useful for dynamically modifying the structure of a node graph by eliminating unwanted nodes.
