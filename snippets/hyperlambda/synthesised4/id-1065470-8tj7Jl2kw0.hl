/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name in the current context. In this case, it looks for a node named [.no] within the current node's hierarchy. The `@` iterator is useful when you want to find a specific node by name without traversing siblings, focusing on the current node and its children.
 * 2. `.no` - This specifies the name of the node you are looking for. The combination of `@` and `.no` means you are searching for a node named [.no] in the current context. This is particularly useful when you need to access or manipulate data within a specific node identified by its name.
