// This Hyperlambda code snippet returns a result from a previously executed signal, specifically retrieving the value from a node named [cached] within the signal's result. It also includes additional metadata about the return operation, such as the finish reason being "cached" and indicating that streaming is not enabled with [stream:bool:false]. The structure is likely used to standardize the output format when returning results from cached operations.
