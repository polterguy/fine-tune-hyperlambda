/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the current node's value ends with ".hl" using [strings.ends-with]. If true, it converts the node's first child to a lambda object with [hyper2lambda], then increments [.loc] by the count of nodes in the lambda object, and increments [.files] by one. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks a condition and executes its [.lambda] if true.
 * 2. [strings.ends-with] - Checks if the current node's value ends with ".hl".
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 4. [hyper2lambda] - Converts the first child of the current node to a lambda object.
 * 5. [math.increment] - Increments the value of [.loc] by the count of nodes in the lambda object.
 * 6. [get-count] - Returns the number of nodes in the lambda object.
 * 7. [math.increment] - Increments the value of [.files] by one.
