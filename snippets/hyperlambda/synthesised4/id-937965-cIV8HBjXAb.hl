// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a "contacts" table in a database using the [data.read] slot. It allows for dynamic control over the number of records returned and the starting point of the query through the [limit] and [offset] slots, which are set using arguments. The [where] slot is used to specify filtering conditions, with the [or] slot indicating that multiple conditions can be applied to filter the results.
