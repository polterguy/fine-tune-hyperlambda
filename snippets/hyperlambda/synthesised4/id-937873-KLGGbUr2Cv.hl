// The code demonstrates how to use the [insert-before] slot to insert a new node before a specified node in a Hyperlambda structure. It inserts a node with the name [log0] and value "Previous log entry" before the node [log1] within the [logs] node. This operation is useful for dynamically modifying the structure by adding new elements in a specific order.
insert-before:x:@.logs/*/log1

      log0:Previous log entry
