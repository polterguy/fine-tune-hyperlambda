// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] logical operator in conjunction with the [eq] comparison operator to filter database rows. It checks if the 'rowid' field is equal to the 'id' argument provided in the [.arguments] node. If the condition is true, it will include the row in the result set. This is typically used in SQL query construction to ensure that only rows with a specific 'rowid' are selected based on the provided 'id' argument.
