/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches through the node's ancestors and their siblings to find the node named "session". 
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - This expression is useful when you need to access session-related data or configurations that are defined earlier in the node hierarchy. For example, in a web application, you might use this to retrieve user session information such as user ID, authentication status, or session variables that are stored in a node named "session".
