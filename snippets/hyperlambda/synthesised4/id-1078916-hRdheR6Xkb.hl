/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is used to locate the [.arguments] node, which is typically the starting point for accessing input parameters in a Hyperlambda execution context.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each parameter passed into the Hyperlambda execution context.
 * 
 * 3. `new_tab` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "new_tab". It is used to specifically target the "new_tab" parameter within the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to access the value of a specific argument named "new_tab" that was passed into a Hyperlambda execution context, such as within an HTTP endpoint or a dynamically executed slot.
 * - It can be used to conditionally perform actions based on the presence or value of the "new_tab" argument, such as opening a new browser tab in a web application.
