/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [get-first-value] slot to return the first non-null value from evaluating its children nodes. It first attempts to retrieve a value using [get-value] with a complex expression pointing to a node with an "alt" attribute. If this evaluation returns null, it defaults to returning the static string "Image ". This is useful for providing a fallback value when the primary source is unavailable or null. 
 * 
 * 1. [get-first-value] - Returns the first non-null value from its children nodes.
 * 2. [get-value] - Attempts to retrieve a value from a node with an "alt" attribute using a complex expression.
 * 3. [.] - Provides a default static string "Image " if the primary source is null.
