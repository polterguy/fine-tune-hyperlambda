/*
 * The Hyperlambda code snippet inserts nodes obtained from the [get-nodes] slot before the first [fork] node within the current context. The [get-nodes] slot retrieves nodes referenced by the expression [@.invoke], and these nodes are then inserted before the first [fork] node found in the specified path. 
 * 
 * 1. [insert-before] - Inserts nodes before the node(s) referenced in its expression.
 * 2. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the specified expression.
 * 3. [x:./*/fork/0] - Expression pointing to the first [fork] node in the current context.
 * 4. [x:@.invoke] - Expression pointing to the nodes to be retrieved and inserted.
