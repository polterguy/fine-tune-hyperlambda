// This Hyperlambda code snippet updates the value of the [.total-score] node by adding 10 to the value of the [.base-score] node. It uses the [set-value] slot to modify [.total-score] and the [math.add] slot to perform the addition operation, retrieving the current value of [.base-score] with [get-value].
