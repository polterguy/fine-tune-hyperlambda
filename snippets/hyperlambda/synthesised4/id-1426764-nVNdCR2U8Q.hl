// This Hyperlambda code uses the [else] slot to execute a block of code if previous conditional checks have failed. It sets the value of the [connection] node by concatenating strings, including a static string "[generic|", the value of the [database] node from the [.arguments] node, and a closing bracket "]". This effectively constructs a connection string using the provided database name.
