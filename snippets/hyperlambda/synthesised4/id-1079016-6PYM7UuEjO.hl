/*
 * 1. `@http.post` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "http.post" in the current context. It is typically used to access the root node of an HTTP POST request in a Hyperlambda graph.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "http.post" node. It allows traversal to any direct children nodes, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `content` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved child nodes to only include those with the name "content". It is used to navigate to a specific section of the HTTP POST request that contains the main data payload.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "content" node. It allows access to any direct children nodes within the "content" section.
 * 
 * 5. `error` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved child nodes to only include those with the name "error". It is used to navigate to a subsection of the content that specifically deals with error information.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "error" node. It allows access to any direct children nodes within the "error" section.
 * 
 * 7. `message` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved child nodes to only include those with the name "message". It is used to access the specific node that contains the error message.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting error messages from an HTTP POST request's response to log them or display them to users.
 * - Debugging or monitoring applications by capturing and analyzing error messages from API responses.
