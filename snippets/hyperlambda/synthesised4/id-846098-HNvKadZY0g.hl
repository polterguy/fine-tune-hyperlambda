// This Hyperlambda code snippet modifies the value of the [.result] node by replacing occurrences of a specific substring within it. The [set-value] slot targets the [.result] node, and the [strings.replace] slot is used to search for a substring specified by [[search]] and replace it with "true". The [strings.replace] slot evaluates its arguments to perform the replacement operation.
