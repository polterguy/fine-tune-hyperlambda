/*
 * This Hyperlambda code performs a series of logical checks on a specific node path. It first checks if the node exists and is not null, then verifies that its value is not equal to an empty string or null. The [and] slot ensures all conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. The node path uses escaped characters to navigate through the node structure. 
 * 
 * 1. [exists] - Checks if the specified node path yields one or more results.
 * 2. [not-null] - Ensures the node at the specified path is not null.
 * 3. [neq] - Verifies the node's value is not equal to an empty string.
 * 4. [neq] - Confirms the node's value is not null.
