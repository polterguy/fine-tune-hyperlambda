// This Hyperlambda code checks if either the payment status is "pending" or the shipment status is "delayed". If either condition is true, it sets the notification message to "Action needed". The [or] slot evaluates multiple conditions, and the [eq] slot checks for equality. If any condition within [or] is true, the [if] slot executes its [.lambda] block.
