// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [insert-before] slot to insert a node before a specified node in a Hyperlambda structure. The [insert-before] slot takes an expression pointing to the target node and inserts a new node before it. In this example, the new node is inserted before the first child of the [.invocation] node, and it contains a child node that references the first child of the [.action] node. This operation allows for dynamic modification of the node structure by inserting nodes at specific positions.
