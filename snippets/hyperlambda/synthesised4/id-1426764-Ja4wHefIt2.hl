/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement to handle boolean values. The [switch] slot evaluates its expression and executes the first [case] node with a matching value. If no [case] matches, the [default] node is executed, if present. This example illustrates how to handle boolean values in a switch-case structure in Hyperlambda.
 * // 1. [.val] - A node with a boolean value that will be evaluated by the [switch] statement.
 * // 2. [.result] - A node where the result of the switch-case evaluation will be stored.
 * // 3. [switch] - A slot that evaluates the expression and executes the matching [case] node.
 * // 4. [case] - A slot representing a possible match for the [switch] expression. If the value matches, its children are executed.
 * // 5. [default] - A slot that is executed if no [case] matches the [switch] expression. It cannot have a value.
