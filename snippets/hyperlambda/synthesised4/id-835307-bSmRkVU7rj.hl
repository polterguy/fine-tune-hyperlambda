// The [return-nodes] slot is used within dynamically created slots to return multiple nodes as a lambda object. It can only be called from inside a dynamic slot or other slots that create a return context. In the example, a slot named "foo" is created, which returns two nodes: [integer-value] with an integer value of 57 and [string-value] with a string value "Foo bar". The [signal] slot is then used to invoke the "foo" slot.
