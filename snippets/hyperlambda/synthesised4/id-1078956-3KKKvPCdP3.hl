/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator starts by selecting the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and the `.` before `arguments` specifies that it is looking for a node at the same level or higher in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access the direct children of the `.arguments` node, allowing further filtering or operations on these children.
 * 
 * 3. `lead_email`: This iterator filters the previously selected children nodes to find the node named `lead_email`. It selects only the node(s) with this specific name from the children of `.arguments`.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to retrieve the email address of a lead from a set of arguments passed to a function or endpoint. It is useful for extracting specific data fields from a structured input.
