/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to perform a SQL query on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "Treatments" table. It utilizes a left join to associate records from the "Treatments" table with the "Patients" table based on matching "PatientID" fields. The query selects columns, including an aggregate function, and groups the results by a specified column. The [return-nodes] slot is used to return the results of the query. The key slots and their functions are as follows:
 * 
 * 1. [data.read] - Initiates a read operation from a database.
 * 2. [database-type] - Specifies the type of database being used, in this case, SQLite.
 * 3. [table] - Indicates the primary table to query, "Treatments".
 * 4. [join] - Specifies a left join operation with the "Patients" table, using "PatientID" as the joining key.
 * 5. [columns] - Lists the columns to be included in the result set, including an aggregate function.
 * 6. [where] - Placeholder for conditions to filter the query results.
 * 7. [group] - Specifies the column by which the results should be grouped.
 * 8. [return-nodes] - Returns the nodes resulting from the query execution.
