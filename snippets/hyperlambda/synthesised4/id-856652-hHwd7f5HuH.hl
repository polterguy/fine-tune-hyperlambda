// This Hyperlambda code evaluates a logical OR condition to determine if a filter should be applied to a path. It checks if the filter node does not exist, if it exists but is null, or if the path contains the filter value. The [or] slot ensures that if any of these conditions are true, the overall expression evaluates to true. The [not-exists] and [null] slots check for the presence and value of the filter, while [strings.contains] checks if the path contains the filter value.
