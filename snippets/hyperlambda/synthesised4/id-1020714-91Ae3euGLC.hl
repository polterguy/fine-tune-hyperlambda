/*
 * 1. `-` - This iterator retrieves the previous result set's younger sibling, which is the node directly above it in the Hyperlambda structure. It is useful when you need to access or manipulate the node that is immediately preceding the current node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. It is commonly used when you want to access or perform operations on all child nodes of a particular node, allowing you to iterate over or manipulate them collectively.
