// This Hyperlambda code uses the [set-value] slot to modify the value of the [.content] node. It employs the [strings.regex-replace] slot to search for patterns in the [.arguments/*/body] node's value that match the regular expression "!\\[.*\\]\\(.*\\)", which typically identifies Markdown image syntax, and replaces them with an empty string. This effectively removes Markdown image links from the text.
