/*
 * 1. `@.prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node named "prompt" within the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it will look for the node by its name, and the "." before "prompt" specifies that it should start the search from the current node's parent. 
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve a specific node named "prompt" that is a sibling of the current node, which might contain important data or configuration settings relevant to the current operation.
 * - It could be used in a scenario where you need to dynamically adjust or retrieve settings or parameters that are stored in a node named "prompt" within a larger data structure.
