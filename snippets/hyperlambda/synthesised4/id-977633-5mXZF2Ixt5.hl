// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to delete records from a specified table in a SQLite database using the [data.delete] slot. The [database-type] specifies the database as SQLite, and the [table] specifies the table from which records will be deleted. The [where] clause, combined with [and], allows for specifying conditions that records must meet to be deleted.
