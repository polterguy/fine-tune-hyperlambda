// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [signal] slot to concatenate a connection string and a database name. The [strings.concat] slot is invoked to combine the values of [connection-string] and [database], where [connection-string] retrieves its value from the [.connection-string] node, and [database] retrieves its value from the [name] child node of the currently iterated node referenced by [.dp].
