/*
 * 1. `@.urls`: This iterator looks for the first node named "urls" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node's siblings. It will return the first node it finds with the name "urls". 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve a node containing a list of URLs or related data, which might be used for further processing, such as iterating over each URL to perform network requests or validations.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to access configuration or data nodes that are named "urls" and are located somewhere in the current execution context.
