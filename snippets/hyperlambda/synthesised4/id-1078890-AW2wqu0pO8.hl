/*
 * 1. `@html2lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named "html2lambda" in the current context. It starts the expression by locating this specific node, which acts as the root for subsequent operations.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the "html2lambda" node. It is used to explore deeper into the hierarchy and access the next level of nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `head` - This filters the result set to only include nodes named "head" among the children of "html2lambda". It narrows down the search to nodes that are likely to contain metadata about an HTML document.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the "head" node. It allows access to the elements within the "head" section of an HTML-like structure.
 * 
 * 5. `base` - This filters the result set to only include nodes named "base". The "base" tag in HTML specifies a base URL for relative URLs in a document, so this step focuses on finding such nodes.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the "base" node. It is used to access attributes or further nested elements within the "base" node.
 * 
 * 7. `\@href` - This retrieves the first node with the name "href" among the children of the "base" node. The backslash is used to escape the "@" character, which is part of the node name in this context. This step is crucial for accessing the "href" attribute, which typically contains a URL.
 * 
 * 8. `[0,1]` - This retrieves the first node from the result set. It is used to select the first occurrence of the "href" node, ensuring that only one node is returned even if there are multiple matches.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include extracting the base URL from an HTML document's "head" section to resolve relative URLs, or for web scraping tasks where the base URL is needed to construct complete URLs from relative paths.
