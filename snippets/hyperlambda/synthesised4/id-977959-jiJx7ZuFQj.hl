// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to select records from a table named "transactions" in a database. The [data.read] slot is used to perform a read operation on a specified table, which in this case is "transactions". By default, this operation will limit the result set to 25 records unless a different limit is specified. The [table] slot specifies the name of the table from which to read the data.
data.read
   table:transactions
