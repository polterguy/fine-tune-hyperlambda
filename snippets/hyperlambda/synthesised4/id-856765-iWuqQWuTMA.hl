/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot within a [switch] statement to execute different code blocks based on the value of a specified node. The [switch] slot evaluates the value of the node it points to, and the [case] slots provide different execution paths depending on the node's value. The [default] slot is used to define a fallback execution path if none of the [case] conditions are met. This structure allows for clean and organized conditional branching in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Evaluates the value of the node it points to and determines which [case] block to execute.
 * 2. [case] - Defines a block of code to execute if the [switch] value matches the specified case value.
 * 3. [default] - Provides a fallback execution path if none of the [case] conditions are met.
