/*
 * 1. `@.token`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "token" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it looks for a node by name, and the `.` before "token" specifies that it starts the search from the current node's parent. This expression is useful for retrieving a specific node named "token" that is a sibling or a direct child of the current node's parent. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving an authentication token stored in a sibling node for use in API calls.
 * - Accessing a session token within a hierarchical data structure to validate user sessions.
