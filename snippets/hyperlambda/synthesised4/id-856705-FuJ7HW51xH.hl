// The code checks if a node named "class" does not exist within the ".arguments" node or if the "class" value is not contained within the "@class" attribute of the current node's children. It uses the [or] slot to evaluate these conditions, [not-exists] to verify the absence of the "class" node, and [strings.contains] to check if the class value is present in the "@class" attribute.
