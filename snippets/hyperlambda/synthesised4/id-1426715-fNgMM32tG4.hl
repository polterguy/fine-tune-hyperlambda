// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of the [max_tokens] node, which is a child of the [model] node. The [get-value] slot is used to access the value of a specific node within a hierarchical structure by specifying a path expression. In this case, the expression points to the [max_tokens] node under the [model] node, and the value of this node is returned.
