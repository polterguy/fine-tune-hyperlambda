// 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` prefix specifies that it starts the search from the current node's context. This expression is useful for accessing session-related data within a Hyperlambda execution context, such as retrieving user session information or session-specific variables.
