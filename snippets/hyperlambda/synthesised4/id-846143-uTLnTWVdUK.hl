// This Hyperlambda code snippet evaluates two conditions using logical AND. It checks if the HTTP GET response status code is more than or equal to 200 and less than 300, indicating a successful HTTP response. The [and] slot ensures both conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate as true.
