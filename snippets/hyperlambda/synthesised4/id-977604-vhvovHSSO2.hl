// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to use the [sqlite.read] slot to construct a SQL query that selects specific columns from a table with filtering, ordering, and limiting. It selects the "name" and "age" columns from the "castles" table where the "age" is greater than or equal to 500, orders the results by "age" in descending order, and limits the result set to 3 records. The slots used include [sqlite.read] for reading data, [columns] for specifying which columns to select, [where] for filtering conditions, [order] and [direction] for sorting, and [limit] for restricting the number of returned records.
