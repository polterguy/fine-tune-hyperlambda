// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, it evaluates the expression [x:+/*/*/.sse/*/.session], which navigates through the node structure to retrieve the [.session] nodes under [.sse] nodes. This allows for pre-evaluation of expressions, enabling forward evaluation within lambda objects.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/.sse/*/.session
