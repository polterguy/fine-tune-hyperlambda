/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot in Hyperlambda to retrieve the type name of a node's value. It first declares a node [.foo] with an integer type and value of 57. Then, the [type] slot is used with an expression pointing to the previous node to obtain the type name, which will be "int" in this case. The [type] slot is useful for dynamically determining the data type of a node's value within a Hyperlambda script.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer type and a value of 57.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type name of the value of the previous node.
