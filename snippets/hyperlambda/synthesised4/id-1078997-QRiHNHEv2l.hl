/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to navigate to the top of the node hierarchy from the current position. This is useful when you need to access nodes that are at the root level or when you want to ensure you are starting from the top of the hierarchy for further navigation.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children of the root node. This is useful for iterating over or accessing all nodes that are direct descendants of the root node.
 * 
 * 3. `mysql.connect` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "mysql.connect". It is used to find specific nodes related to MySQL connection configurations or operations. This is useful when you need to perform operations or retrieve information related to MySQL connections.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "mysql.connect" nodes. It allows access to the details or configurations specified within the "mysql.connect" nodes. This is useful for accessing specific configuration details or parameters related to MySQL connections.
 * 
 * 5. `return-nodes` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "return-nodes". It is used to find nodes that are intended to return a set of nodes as a result. This is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate the nodes that are intended to be returned from a MySQL connection operation.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve and manipulate the nodes that are returned as a result of a MySQL connection operation. It can be useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze the results of a database query or operation.
 * - It can also be used to verify or debug the nodes that are being returned from a MySQL connection operation, ensuring that the expected data is being retrieved and processed correctly.
