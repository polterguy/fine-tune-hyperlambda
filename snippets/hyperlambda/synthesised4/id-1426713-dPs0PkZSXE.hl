// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate an expression before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, the expression [x:+/*] is evaluated, which means it will forward evaluate all expressions pointed to by the expression supplied as a value to unwrap itself. This is useful when you want to ensure that the expression is evaluated and its result is available before the execution continues to the next node.
unwrap:x:+/*
