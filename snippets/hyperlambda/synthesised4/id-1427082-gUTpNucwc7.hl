/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Orders" and "Employees". The join is configured to match records where the "EmployeeID" column in the "Orders" table is equal to the "EmployeeID" column in the "Employees" table. The join is given an alias "EmployeeID" for the "Employees" table. The use of a left join ensures that all records from the "Orders" table are included, even if there are no matching records in the "Employees" table.
 * // 1. [join] - Specifies the table to join with, in this case, "Employees".
 * // 2. [as] - Provides an alias for the "Employees" table, here "EmployeeID".
 * // 3. [type] - Defines the type of join, which is "left" in this instance.
 * // 4. [on] - Begins the condition for the join.
 * // 5. [and] - Combines multiple conditions, though only one is provided here.
 * // 6. [Orders.EmployeeID:EmployeeID.EmployeeID] - The condition for the join, matching "EmployeeID" from "Orders" with "EmployeeID" from "Employees".
