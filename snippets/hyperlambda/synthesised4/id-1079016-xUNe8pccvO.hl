/*
 * 1. `@.tmp-completion`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node named "tmp-completion" in the current context. It uses the `@` symbol to indicate that it should look for a node by name. This iterator is useful when you need to access a specific node directly by its name, especially when dealing with complex node structures where the target node is not a direct child of the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or temporary data stored under a node named "tmp-completion".
 * - Retrieving a specific node's value to use in further computations or logic within a Hyperlambda script.
