/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator looks for the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary. This is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any node that is a direct child of the "arguments" node, regardless of its name.
 * 
 * 3. `model` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "model". It is used to specifically target the "model" node among the children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include accessing a specific argument named "model" that has been passed to a function or slot, possibly to retrieve configuration or parameter data related to a machine learning model or other computational model.
