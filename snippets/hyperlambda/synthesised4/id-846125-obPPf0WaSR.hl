// The code snippet dynamically adds nodes to the [.session] node. It creates a nested structure with a [role] node set to "assistant" and a [content] node whose value is derived from the [prompt] node within the current [.dp] reference. The [.dp] reference is typically used in iterative contexts to point to the current node being processed.
