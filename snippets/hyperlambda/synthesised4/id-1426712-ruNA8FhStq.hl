// This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [prefix] exists within the [.arguments] node, is not null, and is not equal to an empty string. The [and] slot ensures that all three conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. Specifically, it uses [exists] to verify the presence of the [prefix] node, [not-null] to ensure it has a value, and [neq] to confirm that the value is not an empty string.
