// The [else] slot is used to execute a block of code when all preceding [if] and [else-if] conditions evaluate to false. In this example, if none of the previous conditions are met, the [add] slot appends a node with the name [nullable] and a boolean value of true to the children of the [.tmp] node. This ensures a default action is taken when no other conditions are satisfied.
