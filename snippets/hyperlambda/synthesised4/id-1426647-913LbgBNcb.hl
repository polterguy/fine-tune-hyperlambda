/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a new node structure to each node under the [candidates] node, which is a child of the [return] node. For each node added, it creates two child nodes: [name] and [expression], both of which are set to the value of the [x] node, and a [complete] node set to true. This effectively duplicates the value of [x] into both [name] and [expression] for each candidate, and marks each candidate as complete.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node structure to each node under the [candidates] node.
 * 2. [name] - Sets the name of the node to the value of [x].
 * 3. [expression] - Sets the expression of the node to the value of [x].
 * 4. [complete] - Sets the complete status of the node to true.
