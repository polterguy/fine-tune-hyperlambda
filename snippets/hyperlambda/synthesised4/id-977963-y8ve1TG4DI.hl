// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a database table named "shipments" using the [data.read] slot. The [table] slot specifies the table from which to select records. By default, the operation will return a limited number of records unless additional parameters like [limit] are specified to override this behavior.
data.read
   table:shipments
