/*
 * This Hyperlambda code generates a unique filename for a file attachment by concatenating a static string with a newly generated GUID and a file extension. It uses the [strings.concat] slot to concatenate multiple strings, including a GUID generated by [guid.new], to form a complete filename with a ".jsonl" extension. The resulting filename is then set as the value of the [.filename] node using [set-value]. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.filename] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings to form the filename.
 * 3. [.] - Static string "attachment; name=file; filename=\"training-file-" used as the beginning of the filename.
 * 4. [guid.new] - Generates a new GUID to ensure the filename is unique.
 * 5. [.] - Static string ".jsonl" used as the file extension.
 * 6. [.] - Static string "\"" used to close the filename.
