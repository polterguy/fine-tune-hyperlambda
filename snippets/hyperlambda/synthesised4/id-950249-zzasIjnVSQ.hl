/*
 * This code snippet demonstrates how to use the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve all descendant nodes of the [.data] node. The expression [x:@.data/**] specifies that the operation should include all nodes under [.data], regardless of their depth in the hierarchy. This is useful for accessing a complete subtree within a Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 1. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes based on the provided expression.
 * 2. [x:@.data/**] - Expression to select all descendant nodes of [.data].
