/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [set-value] slot to modify the value of a node by trimming specific characters from it. The [strings.trim] slot is used to remove commas from the value of the node referenced by the expression in [set-value]. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.trim] - Trims specified characters from the value of the node.
 * 3. [.] - Specifies the characters to be trimmed, in this case, a comma.
