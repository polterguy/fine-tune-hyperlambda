/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `data` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "data" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target the "data" argument if it exists.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to access and manipulate the "data" argument passed to it, allowing for operations such as validation, transformation, or processing of the data contained within this argument.
