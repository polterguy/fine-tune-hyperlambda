// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to append a node to a specified location in a Hyperlambda graph. It targets the [dates] node and adds a new node containing the value of the currently iterated node, referenced by [.dp], using the [#] iterator to dereference its value. This operation effectively appends the dereferenced value to the [dates] node.
