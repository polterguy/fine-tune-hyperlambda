/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named [.arguments] starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to locate the [.arguments] node, which is a common node in Hyperlambda for passing arguments to slots or endpoints.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any arguments that have been passed as children of the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `folder` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named [folder]. It is used to specifically target the [folder] node among the children of the [.arguments] node, which might represent a directory or folder argument in the context of a file system operation or similar functionality.
