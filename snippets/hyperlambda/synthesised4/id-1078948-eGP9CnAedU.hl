/*
 * 1. `@.key`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "key" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts from the current node's position and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node named "key". 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access a configuration or parameter node named "key" that is defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure, allowing you to reuse or reference its value.
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to retrieve a specific node's value that acts as a key or identifier for further processing or conditional logic.
