/*
 * This Hyperlambda code replaces all occurrences of the carriage return character ("\r") in the value of the [.anchor] node with a space character (" "). It first retrieves the value of [.anchor], performs the replacement, and then sets the modified value back to [.anchor]. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.anchor] node.
 * 2. [strings.replace] - Replaces occurrences of a specified string within another string.
 * 3. [.] (first child) - Specifies the string to be replaced ("\r").
 * 4. [.] (second child) - Specifies the replacement string (" ").
