/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. This is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or an endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument provided to the function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 3. `model` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [model]. It is used to specifically access the argument named "model" among the children of [.arguments].
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to retrieve the value of the "model" argument. This is useful when you need to perform operations or validations specifically on the "model" argument passed to your function or endpoint.
