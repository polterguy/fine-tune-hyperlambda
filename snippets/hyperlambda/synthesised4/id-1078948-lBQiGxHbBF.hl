/*
 * 1. `@.model`: This iterator looks for the first node named "model" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, checking each node's name until it finds a match. This is useful for locating a specific node when you know its name but not its exact position in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "model" node. It is used to access the direct descendants of a node, which can be useful when you want to perform operations on all child nodes or need to filter them further.
 * 
 * 3. `max_requests`: This iterator filters the children nodes of the "model" node to find a node named "max_requests". It is used to pinpoint a specific node among the children, allowing for operations or evaluations specific to that node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve the "max_requests" node within a "model" node, which might represent a configuration setting or limit for the number of requests a model can handle. This could be useful in scenarios where you need to enforce or check request limits dynamically.
