// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this case, it evaluates the expression to access deeply nested nodes, specifically targeting the [.sse] node within the hierarchy. This allows for pre-evaluation of expressions, ensuring that the [.session] data within the [.sse] node is accessed and processed before further execution.
