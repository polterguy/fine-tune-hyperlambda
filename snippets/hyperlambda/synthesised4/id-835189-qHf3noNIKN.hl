// This Hyperlambda code checks if an HTTP GET request was unsuccessful by ensuring the status code is not between 200 and 299. If the request fails, it converts the HTTP response to a Hyperlambda object using [lambda2hyper], logs an error with the URL and error details, and returns the original HTTP response. The [if] condition uses [not] and [and] to verify the status code range, while [log.error] records the error information.
