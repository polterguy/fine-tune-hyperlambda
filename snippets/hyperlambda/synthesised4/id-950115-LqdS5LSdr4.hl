// This Hyperlambda code establishes a database connection using [data.connect] with a specified connection string and database name. It reads from the "cloudlets" table, applying a filter condition based on the authenticated user's ID obtained via [auth.ticket.get]. If any records exist, it throws an exception with a message indicating that all cloudlets must be deleted before account deletion, using the [throw] slot with public visibility and a status code of 400.
