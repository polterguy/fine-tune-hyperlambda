/*
 * This code checks if the HTTP GET request's headers do not start with the content type "text/html". It uses the [not] slot to invert the result of the [strings.starts-with] slot, which evaluates whether the "Content-Type" header of the HTTP GET request begins with "text/html". If it does not, the overall condition evaluates to true.
 * 
 * 1. [not] - Inverts the result of the condition.
 * 2. [strings.starts-with] - Checks if the "Content-Type" header starts with "text/html".
 * 3. [x:@http.get/*/headers/*/Content-Type] - Expression pointing to the "Content-Type" header in the HTTP GET request's headers.
 * 4. [.:text/html] - Static value representing the string "text/html" to compare against.
