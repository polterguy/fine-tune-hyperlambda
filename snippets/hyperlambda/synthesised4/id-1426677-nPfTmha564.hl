// The Hyperlambda code converts the value of a node, which is the result of a [data.read] operation inside a [data.connect] block, to an integer type. The expression [@data.connect/*/data.read/*/*/count] points to a specific node within the data read operation, and the [convert] slot changes its type to integer.
