/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is useful when you need to access the top-level node from any depth within the node hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it will get all the children of the root node.
 * 
 * 3. `return` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "return". It is used to find specific nodes by name within the current set of nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to locate all "return" nodes that are direct children of the root node in a Hyperlambda file. This might be useful for analyzing or modifying the return values of a Hyperlambda script.
