/*
 * 1. `@html2lambda` - This iterator looks for the first node named `html2lambda` in the current context. It is used to locate a specific section of the Hyperlambda graph where the HTML content is likely stored or processed.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the `html2lambda` node. It is used to access the next level of nodes under `html2lambda`, which could represent different aspects or components of the HTML conversion process.
 * 
 * 3. `html` - This filters the previous result set to include only nodes named `html`. It is used to specifically target nodes that represent HTML content or structure within the `html2lambda` context.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the `html` node. It is used to delve deeper into the HTML structure, accessing elements like `head`, `body`, etc.
 * 
 * 5. `body` - This filters the previous result set to include only nodes named `body`. It is used to focus on the main content of the HTML document, which is typically where links and other interactive elements are found.
 * 
 * 6. `**` - This retrieves all descendant nodes of the `body` node, including the node itself. It is used to perform a comprehensive search through the entire body content for specific elements.
 * 
 * 7. `a` - This filters the previous result set to include only nodes named `a`, which represent anchor (link) elements in HTML. It is used to locate all links within the body of the HTML document.
 * 
 * 8. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of each `a` node. It is used to access attributes or nested elements within each link.
 * 
 * 9. `\@class` - This retrieves the `class` attribute of each `a` node. It is used to identify links with specific styling or functionality, as determined by their class attribute.
 * 
 * 10. `=result__a` - This filters the previous result set to include only nodes with a value of `result__a`. It is used to find links that have a specific class value, potentially indicating a particular type of link or functionality.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include extracting all links from an HTML document that have a specific class attribute, such as `result__a`, which might be used to identify search result links or other categorized links within a web page. This could be useful in web scraping or data extraction tasks where only certain types of links are of interest.
