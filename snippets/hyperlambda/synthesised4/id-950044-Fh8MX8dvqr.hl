// The code checks if the value of [.message] is not equal to "Welcome Home" using the [neq] slot. If the condition is true, it logs an informational message indicating that [.message] is not "Welcome Home". The [if] slot evaluates the condition, and the [.lambda] block contains the action to be executed if the condition is met.
