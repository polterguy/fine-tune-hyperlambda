// 1. `@.filename` - This iterator starts with the `@` symbol, which is used to find the first node with the specified name in the current context. In this case, it looks for a node named `filename` that is a sibling or a child of the current node. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name within the current scope, such as retrieving a file name from a list of nodes representing file metadata.
