// This code snippet uses the [set-value] slot to modify the value of the [tmp-prompt] node by concatenating the current value of the [prompt] node with a separator and the text content of a specific node. The [strings.concat] slot is employed for concatenation, and [get-value] is used to retrieve the values from the specified nodes. The expression in [get-value] navigates to a text node using escaped iterators.
