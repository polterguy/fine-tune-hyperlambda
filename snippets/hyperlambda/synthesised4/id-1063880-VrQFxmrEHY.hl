/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is typically used to access the root arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which contains all the arguments passed to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node, which in this case is the "arguments" node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `feedback-channel` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "feedback-channel" from the previously selected nodes. It is used to specifically access the "feedback-channel" argument node, if it exists, within the "arguments" node's children.
