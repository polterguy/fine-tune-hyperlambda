/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet defines a signal named "magic.ai.vectorise" with two child nodes: [feedback-channel] and [type]. The [feedback-channel] node is assigned a static value of "non-existing", while the [type] node's value is dynamically set using a lambda expression that retrieves the value of the [type] node from the [.arguments] node's children. This setup is likely used to configure or trigger an AI vectorization process, where the type of vectorization is determined by an argument passed to the signal. 
 * 
 * 1. [signal] - Declares a signal named "magic.ai.vectorise".
 * 2. [feedback-channel] - Sets a static value of "non-existing".
 * 3. [type] - Dynamically retrieves the value of the [type] node from the [.arguments] node's children.
