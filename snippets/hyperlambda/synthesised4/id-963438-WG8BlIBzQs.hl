// The [unwrap] slot is used to evaluate expressions before reaching the node where it's referenced. In this example, it evaluates the expression pointing to the [args] node's children and assigns the result to the [result] node. This allows for forward evaluation of expressions within a lambda object, ensuring that the [result] node's value is set before the lambda object is executed.
