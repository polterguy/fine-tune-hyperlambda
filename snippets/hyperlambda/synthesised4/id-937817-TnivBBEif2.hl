// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates a loop using [while] that continues executing as long as the value of [requests] is less than 10. Inside the loop, it logs a message "Processing request" and increments the [requests] value by 1. The loop ensures that the process is repeated until the [requests] count reaches 10.
