/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [get-value] slot to retrieve the value of a node specified by its expression. The expression points to a node named [.ignored], and the [get-value] slot will return the value of this node. This operation is useful when you need to access or manipulate the value of a specific node within a larger node structure. Below is a breakdown of the slots used in this example.
 * // 
 * // 1. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression [x:@.ignored].
