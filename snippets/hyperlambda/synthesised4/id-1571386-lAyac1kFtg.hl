 * 1. `@.arguments` - Retrieves the first node named [.arguments] before the current node in the hierarchy.
 * 2. `*` - Retrieves all children of the [.arguments] node.
 * 3. `stream` - Filters and returns all child nodes named [stream] from the previous result set. 
 * 
 * The overall effect is to return all [stream] nodes that are children of the first [.arguments] node found before the current node in the hierarchy.
