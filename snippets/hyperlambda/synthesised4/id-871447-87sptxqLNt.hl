// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL query using the [data.read] slot with a left join between the "documents" and "clients" tables in an SQLite database. It specifies a column with an aggregate function, aliases it as "result", and applies a condition with [where] and [and] slots. The query is limited to return only one result. The [join] slot is used to define the relationship between the tables, and [limit] ensures only a single row is retrieved.
