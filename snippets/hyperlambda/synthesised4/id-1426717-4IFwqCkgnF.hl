/*
 * This Hyperlambda code throws an exception with a message extracted from the HTTP POST response, specifically from the "message" node within the "error" node in the response content. The exception is marked as public, meaning it will be visible to the client, and the status code of the exception is set to the same status code as the HTTP POST response. 
 * 
 * 1. [throw] - Initiates an exception with a message derived from the HTTP POST response.
 * 2. [public] - Marks the exception as public, allowing it to be visible to the client.
 * 3. [status] - Sets the exception's status code to the status code from the HTTP POST response.
