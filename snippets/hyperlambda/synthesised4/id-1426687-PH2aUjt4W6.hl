/*
 * This Hyperlambda code constructs a URL by concatenating the scheme and host. It retrieves the scheme from a node, appends "://" to it, and then appends the host from the request. The resulting URL is then set as the value of the [.url] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the [.url] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings to form a URL.
 * 3. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the [.scheme] node.
 * 4. [.] - Static string "://" used as a separator between scheme and host.
 * 5. [request.host] - Retrieves the host from the request to append to the URL.
