// 1. `@.allow`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "allow" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings, until it finds a node named "allow". This is useful when you need to check or retrieve a specific configuration or permission setting that might be defined in a parent or sibling node, such as checking if a certain action is permitted in a configuration file or settings object.
