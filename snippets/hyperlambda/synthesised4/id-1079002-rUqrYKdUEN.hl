/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator looks for the first node named [.dp] in the current context. It is typically used to access a specific node that is expected to exist in the current execution scope, often used in loops or dynamic slot executions where [.dp] represents the current node being processed.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the [.dp] node, assuming that its value is another node. It allows you to access the node that is stored as the value of [.dp], effectively treating the value as a reference to another node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous step. It is used to access every direct child node under the node referenced by [.dp].
 * 
 * 4. `is_pk` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named [is_pk]. It is used to find specific nodes among the children of the node referenced by [.dp] that have the name [is_pk].
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a database schema context where [.dp] represents a table or a row, and [is_pk] is a flag indicating whether a column is a primary key. The expression would help identify all primary key columns within a given table or row structure.
 * - It might also be used in a data processing pipeline to filter out nodes that are marked as primary keys for further processing or validation.
