/*
 * 1. `@.assumption`: This iterator searches for the first node named "assumption" in the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors. This iterator is useful when you need to reference a specific node by name that might be located at any level above the current node in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - You might use this expression to check or retrieve the value of an "assumption" node that is defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure, ensuring that your current logic aligns with predefined assumptions.
 * - It can be used in conditional logic to verify if certain assumptions hold true before proceeding with further operations.
