// This Hyperlambda code snippet sets the value of the [type] node to "string" and changes the value of the [automatic] node within a nested structure to true. It uses [set-value] to modify node values, ensuring the [type] node is explicitly set to a string type and marking the [automatic] node as true, indicating some form of automatic processing or state.
