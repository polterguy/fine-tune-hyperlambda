/*
 * 1. `@json2lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "json2lambda". It starts the traversal from the root of the current context and searches for a node named "json2lambda". This is useful for locating a specific node in a larger structure that contains JSON data converted to Hyperlambda format.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "json2lambda" node. It is used to access all immediate child nodes, allowing further traversal or operations on these nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `message` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved node set to only include nodes with the name "message". It is used to narrow down the node set to those specifically named "message", which might represent a specific part of the data structure, such as a message or a communication payload.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "message" node. It allows access to the contents or sub-elements within the "message" node, enabling further operations or data extraction.
 * 
 * 5. `content` - This iterator filters the node set to include only nodes named "content". It is used to access specific data within the "message" node, likely representing the actual content or body of the message.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting and processing the content of messages from a JSON structure that has been converted to Hyperlambda, such as in a messaging application or a logging system.
 * - Navigating through a structured data format to retrieve specific information for further processing or analysis, like extracting message content for display or storage.
