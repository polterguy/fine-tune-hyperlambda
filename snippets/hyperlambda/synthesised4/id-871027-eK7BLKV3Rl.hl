// This Hyperlambda code snippet replaces occurrences of double newlines in the [.content] node with a single newline. It uses [strings.replace] to perform the replacement and [set-value] to update the [.content] node with the modified string. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the string to be replaced, and the second is the replacement string. The [set-value] slot updates the value of the [.content] node with the result of the [strings.replace] operation.
