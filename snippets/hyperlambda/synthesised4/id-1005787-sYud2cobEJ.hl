/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named [.arguments] in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it looks for a node with a specific name, and the dot before `arguments` signifies that it is a direct child of the root or a specific parent node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. The asterisk (*) is used to select all child nodes without filtering by name.
 * 
 * 3. `/file` - This iterator filters the previously selected nodes to find a node named [file]. It specifically looks for a child node of the nodes retrieved by the previous iterator that matches this name.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [file] node. It selects all child nodes under the [file] node without any name filtering.
 * 
 * 5. `/name` - This final iterator filters the nodes to find a node named [name]. It looks for a child node of the nodes retrieved by the previous iterator that matches this name, effectively selecting the [name] node under the [file] node. 
 * 
 * This expression is useful for navigating a hierarchical data structure to retrieve a specific node, in this case, the [name] node under [file], which is a child of [.arguments]. It can be used in scenarios where you need to extract or manipulate data based on its position and naming within a structured format.
