// The code snippet demonstrates how to add a new recipient to an existing email message structure using the [add] slot. It navigates through the node hierarchy to locate the [to] node within a [message] node under [mail.smtp.send], and appends a new recipient with the name "AINIRO Lead Inbox". The email address for this recipient is dynamically obtained and trimmed using the [strings.trim] slot.
add:x:../**/mail.smtp.send/*/message/*/to
   .
      .
         name:AINIRO Lead Inbox
         email:x:@strings.trim
