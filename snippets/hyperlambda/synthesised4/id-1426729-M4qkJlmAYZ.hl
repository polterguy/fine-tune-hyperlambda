// This Hyperlambda code uses the [validators.default] slot to ensure that certain nodes exist within the [.arguments] node. If the nodes [images], [lists], or [code] do not exist, they are created with a default boolean value of true. If they exist but have a null value, their value is set to true. This ensures that the specified nodes have a default value, facilitating consistent behavior in subsequent operations.
