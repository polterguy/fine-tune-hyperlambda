// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to dynamically append a node to a destination node. The [add] slot targets the node referenced by the expression in its main argument, which is [@.dp/#], and appends a new node with the name [vector] and a boolean value of true as its child. The [.dp] node is typically used in contexts like [for-each] loops to refer to the currently iterated node by reference.
