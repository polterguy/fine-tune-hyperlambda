/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] from the current node's context. It is often used to access the arguments passed into a function, slot, or HTTP endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument individually.
 * 
 * 3. `stream` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "stream". It is used to specifically target the "stream" argument within the [.arguments] node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda slot or HTTP endpoint to access and manipulate a specific argument named "stream" that has been passed to the function or endpoint.
 * - It might be used in a scenario where streaming data needs to be processed or validated, and the "stream" argument contains the necessary data or configuration for the operation.
