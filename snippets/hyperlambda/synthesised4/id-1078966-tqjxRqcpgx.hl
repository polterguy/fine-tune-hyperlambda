/*
 * 1. `@.snippets` - This iterator starts by locating the first node named "snippets" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node with the specified name, while the `.` ensures that it begins its search from the current node's context.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "snippets" node. The `*` symbol is used to access every direct child node beneath the "snippets" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to gather all child nodes under a node named "snippets" for processing or analysis.
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you need to iterate over a collection of code snippets or similar grouped data elements for further operations such as transformation, validation, or aggregation.
