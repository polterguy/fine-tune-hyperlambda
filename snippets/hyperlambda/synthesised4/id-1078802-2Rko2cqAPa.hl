/*
 * 1. `@json2lambda`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "json2lambda" in the current context. It starts from the root or current node and traverses the hierarchy to find the first matching node. This is useful when you want to directly access a specific node by name, ensuring that only the first occurrence is retrieved.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node found by the previous iterator. It is used to access all immediate descendants of the "json2lambda" node. This is useful when you need to process or evaluate all child nodes of a specific parent node, such as when converting JSON data into a Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * 
 * - Converting JSON data to Hyperlambda by iterating over each child node of a JSON root node named "json2lambda".
 * - Accessing and processing all elements within a specific section of a Hyperlambda document that is structured under a "json2lambda" node.
