/*
 * 1. `@.lambda` - This iterator searches for the first node named "lambda" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node that is named "lambda" within the current node hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "lambda" node found in the previous step. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "lambda" node.
 * 
 * 3. `lambda2hyper` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "lambda2hyper" among the children of the "lambda" node. It is used to narrow down the search to nodes with a specific name.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "lambda2hyper" node found in the previous step. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "lambda2hyper" node.
 * 
 * 5. `timeshifts` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "timeshifts" among the children of the "lambda2hyper" node. It is used to narrow down the search to nodes with a specific name.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "timeshifts" node found in the previous step. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "timeshifts" node.
 * 
 * 7. `logins` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "logins" among the children of the "timeshifts" node. It is used to narrow down the search to nodes with a specific name.
 * 
 * 8. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "logins" node found in the previous step. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "logins" node.
 * 
 * 9. `items` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "items" among the children of the "logins" node. It is used to narrow down the search to nodes with a specific name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda script to navigate through a complex node structure to find and manipulate data related to "items" within a specific hierarchy of nodes. 
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you need to process or analyze login-related data that is organized under a "timeshifts" structure within a larger "lambda2hyper" context.
