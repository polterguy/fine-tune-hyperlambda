// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to query a database table named "employees". It selects the "salary" column and limits the result to a single record. This is useful for retrieving specific data with constraints on the number of records returned, ensuring efficient database access. The [table] slot specifies the target table, [columns] indicates which columns to retrieve, and [limit] restricts the number of returned records.
data.read
   table:employees
   columns
      salary
   limit:int:1
