// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it starts the search from the current node. This is useful when you want to directly access a specific node named "sql" within the current scope or hierarchy, typically used to retrieve a SQL query or command stored in that node.
