// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a database table named "users" using the [data.read] slot. The [data.read] slot is used to construct and execute a SQL SELECT statement to retrieve records from the specified table. By default, it limits the result set to 25 records unless overridden with a [limit] argument. The [table] slot specifies the name of the table from which to read data.
data.read
   table:users
