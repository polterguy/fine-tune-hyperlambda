// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by searching for the first node named "sql" within the current context. The `@` symbol signifies that it will look for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that it will start the search from the current node's level. This is useful when you need to access a specific node named "sql" that is at the same hierarchical level as the current node, allowing you to retrieve or manipulate its value or children nodes.
