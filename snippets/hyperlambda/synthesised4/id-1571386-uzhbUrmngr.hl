 * 1. `+` - Moves to the next sibling node (the node immediately below the current node at the same indentation level).
 * 2. `+` - Moves again to the next sibling node (two nodes below the original node at the same level).
 * 3. `+` - Moves a third time to the next sibling node (three nodes below the original node at the same level).
 * 4. `*` - Retrieves all children of the current node (the third sibling node).
 * 5. `*` - Retrieves all children of each of those child nodes (descendants two levels down from the third sibling node).
 * 6. `.sse` - Filters to only nodes named [.sse] among the current nodes.
 * 7. `*` - Retrieves all children of each [.sse] node.
 * 8. `.user-id` - Filters to only nodes named [.user-id] among the children of [.sse] nodes.
 * 
 * This expression navigates to the third sibling node below the current node, then drills down two levels to find all [.sse] nodes, and finally retrieves all [.user-id] nodes that are children of those [.sse] nodes.
