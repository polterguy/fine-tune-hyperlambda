/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" that is an ancestor of the current node. It is useful for accessing the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda, as these are typically stored in an "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It allows for accessing any argument nodes that are direct children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `folder` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "folder" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically target and work with nodes named "folder" within the arguments.
