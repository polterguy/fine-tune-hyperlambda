/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [.arguments] from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument node that is a direct child of [.arguments].
 * 
 * 3. `distinct_column` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [distinct_column] from the previously retrieved children nodes. It is used to specifically target the node(s) with this name among the arguments.
