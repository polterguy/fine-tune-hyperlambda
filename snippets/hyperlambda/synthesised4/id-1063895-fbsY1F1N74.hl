// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node named "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` indicates that it starts the search from the current node. This is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate a specific node named "sql" within the current scope of your Hyperlambda code.
