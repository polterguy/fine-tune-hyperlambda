/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named [arguments] in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and the dot before it specifies that it should start looking from the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [arguments] node. It essentially expands the search to include all direct children under the [arguments] node.
 * 
 * 3. `/offset` - This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes that have the name "offset". It looks for a child node named "offset" within the previously retrieved set of nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to retrieve a specific parameter or argument named "offset" from a list of arguments passed to a function or an endpoint. 
 * - It could be useful in pagination logic, where "offset" is used to determine the starting point for data retrieval.
