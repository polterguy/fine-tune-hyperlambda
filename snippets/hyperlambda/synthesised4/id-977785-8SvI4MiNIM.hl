// The code snippet demonstrates how to select specific columns from a "customers" table in a database using the [data.read] slot. It retrieves the "name," "username," and "email" columns for a customer with a specific ID, which is dynamically provided through the [.arguments] node. The [where] clause ensures that only the record matching the given customer ID is selected.
