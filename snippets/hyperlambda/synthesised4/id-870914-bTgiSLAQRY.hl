// This Hyperlambda code uses the [add] slot to append nodes to a specific location in the graph. It targets the path "./*/data.update/*/where/*/and" and adds nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot, which references the first node in the [.arguments] collection. The operation effectively extends the "and" condition within a "where" clause of a "data.update" operation with additional arguments.
