// The code uses the [strings.contains] slot to check if the value of the node referenced by the expression contains the substring "{{". The expression [x:@.dp/#/*/completion] navigates through the node structure to locate the specific node whose value is being checked. If the substring "{{" is found within the node's value, the slot will return true.
