/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates a [switch] statement with multiple [case] slots and a [default] slot in Hyperlambda. It evaluates the value of the [h2] node and executes the corresponding [case] block if a match is found. If no match is found, the [default] block is executed. This structure allows for conditional branching based on the value of [h2].
 * 
 * 1. [case] - Evaluates the value of [h2] and executes the block if it matches.
 * 2. [default] - Executes if no [case] value matches the [h2] value.
