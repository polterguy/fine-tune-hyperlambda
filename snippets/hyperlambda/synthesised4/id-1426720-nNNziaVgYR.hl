/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the count of nodes specified by the expression [get-count] is less than 20. If the condition is true, it sets the value of the [.continue] node to false. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Starts a conditional statement.
 * 2. [lt] - Checks if the value from [get-count] is less than 20.
 * 3. [set-value] - Sets the value of [.continue] to false if the condition is true.
