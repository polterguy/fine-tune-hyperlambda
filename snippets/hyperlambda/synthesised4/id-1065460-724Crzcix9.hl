// 1. `@.no` - This iterator retrieves the first node before in its hierarchy that matches the name "no". It starts from the current context and looks upwards in the hierarchy to find the first occurrence of a node named "no". This is useful when you want to access a specific ancestor node by its name, ensuring that you are referencing the correct node in a potentially complex structure.
