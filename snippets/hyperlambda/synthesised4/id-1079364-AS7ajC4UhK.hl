/*
 * 1. `@.no`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no" starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy. It will return the first match it finds. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to check if a node named "no" exists in the current context or any of its ancestors.
 * - It could be used in a conditional statement to determine if a certain configuration or setting is present in the hierarchy.
