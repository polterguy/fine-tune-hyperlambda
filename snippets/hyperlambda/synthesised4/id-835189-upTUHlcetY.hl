// The code snippet demonstrates how to append a Markdown image syntax to the existing content of a node. It uses [set-value] to modify the node's value by concatenating its current content with a Markdown image link. The [strings.concat] slot is used to combine the current content with the new Markdown image syntax, where [get-first-value] retrieves the first non-null alt text for the image, and [get-value] is used to fetch the URL for the image. This results in a Markdown image link being appended to the node's content.
