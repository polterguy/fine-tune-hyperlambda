// This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL read operation on the "cloudlets" table, joining it with the "plans" and "clusters" tables using inner joins. It selects various columns from these tables, including an alias for "clusters.name" as "node_name". The query includes a "where" clause filtering results based on the "user" column, which is compared to a value retrieved from an authentication ticket.
