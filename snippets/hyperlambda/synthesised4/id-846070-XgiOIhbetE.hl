// This Hyperlambda code iterates over nodes and trims whitespace from the 'completion' node's value. It uses [set-value] to update the 'completion' node's value with the result of [strings.trim], which removes leading and trailing whitespace. The [set-value] slot targets the 'completion' node, and [strings.trim] processes its current value.
