 * 1. `@.only-prompt`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "only-prompt" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to retrieve configuration or settings nodes that are defined higher up in the hierarchy, ensuring that the correct context or environment settings are applied to the current operation or logic.
