/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before in its hierarchy that matches the given name, which in this case is ".tmp". It searches upwards from the current node to find the first ancestor node named ".tmp". This is useful when you need to access a specific ancestor node in a deeply nested structure without knowing the exact path.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to find configuration or context data stored in a parent node named ".tmp" when processing a nested data structure, allowing you to apply settings or context-specific logic based on that ancestor node's data.
