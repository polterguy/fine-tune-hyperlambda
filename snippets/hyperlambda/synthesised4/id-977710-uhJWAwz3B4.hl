// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve nodes. The expression points to all nodes that are children of nodes named [.alias-source] located at the same level as the current node. This allows for dynamic access to a set of nodes based on their hierarchical position in the Hyperlambda structure. The [get-nodes] slot is useful for collecting and manipulating node sets within a Hyperlambda graph.
