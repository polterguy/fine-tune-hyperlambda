// This Hyperlambda code calculates the net profit by subtracting the cost and tax from the revenue. It uses the [set-value] slot to assign the result to the [netProfit] node under the [finance] node. The [math.subtract] slot performs the subtraction operation using values retrieved by [get-value] from the [revenue], [cost], and [tax] nodes.
