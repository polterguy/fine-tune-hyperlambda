// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.read] slot to query a database table named "users". It retrieves a single record where the "id" column equals 42. The [where] clause specifies the condition for filtering the records, and the [limit] slot restricts the result set to one record.
data.read
   table:users
   where
      and
         id.eq:int:42
   limit:int:1
