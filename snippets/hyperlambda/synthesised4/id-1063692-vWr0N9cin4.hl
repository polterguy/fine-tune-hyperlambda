/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to navigate back to the top of the node structure, allowing access to nodes that are at the root level.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children nodes of the root node.
 * 3. `signal` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "signal". It is used to specifically target nodes named "signal" among the children of the root node.
 * 4. `*` - Again, this iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. Here, it retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" nodes.
 * 5. `content` - This iterator filters the previous result set to only include nodes with the name "content". It is used to specifically target nodes named "content" among the children of the "signal" nodes.
 * 
 * This expression is useful for accessing "content" nodes that are descendants of "signal" nodes, which are themselves children of the root node. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where "signal" nodes represent events or messages, and "content" nodes contain the details or payload of these events.
