// The [throw] slot in Hyperlambda raises an exception with a specified message. By default, the exception is only visible in debug builds unless a [public] parameter is set to true, allowing it to propagate to the client. Additional parameters like [status] can modify the HTTP status code, and [field] can specify which field triggered the exception.
