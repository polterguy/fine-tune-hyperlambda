// The code demonstrates the use of the [if] slot in Hyperlambda to evaluate a logical condition using the [and] slot. The [and] slot checks if both conditions evaluate to true, but since one condition is false, the [if] block does not execute its lambda, which would have set the value of the [.result] node to "ERROR". The use of [set-value] within the [.lambda] node is intended to modify the [.result] node if the condition is met.
