/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node(s). In this context, it will retrieve all children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `supervised` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "supervised" from the previously selected nodes. It is used to access a specific argument named "supervised".
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used in a Hyperlambda slot or function to access the value of an argument named "supervised" that is passed to it. This is useful in scenarios where the function's behavior depends on the value of this specific argument, such as toggling between supervised and unsupervised modes in a machine learning context.
