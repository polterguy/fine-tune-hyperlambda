// The code uses the [eval] slot to execute all nodes within the [.arguments] node. This allows for dynamic execution of any arguments passed to the Hyperlambda, effectively treating them as executable code blocks. The expression [x:@.arguments] points to the [.arguments] node, and [eval] executes each child node within it sequentially.
eval:x:@.arguments
