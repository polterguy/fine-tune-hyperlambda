/*
 * This Hyperlambda code takes a string, splits it into multiple parts based on new line characters, and then joins these parts back together with new line characters, effectively normalizing line breaks. The [set-value] slot assigns the final result to the [.completion] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.completion] node.
 * 2. [strings.join] - Joins the split parts back together with new line characters.
 * 3. [strings.split] - Splits the original string into parts based on new line characters.
 * 4. [.] - The static value used as a separator in [strings.join].
