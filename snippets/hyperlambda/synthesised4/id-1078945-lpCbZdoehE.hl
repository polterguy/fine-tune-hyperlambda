/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the hierarchy from the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children of the parent node identified by the previous `.` iterator.
 * 
 * 3. `.invoke` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "invoke" among the children of the parent node.
 * 
 * 4. `0` - This iterator retrieves the first child node of the previous result set, which in this case would be the first "invoke" node found among the children.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to find and operate on the first "invoke" node within the children of a parent node, which could be useful in scenarios where you need to execute or manipulate the first invocation logic within a given context.
 * - It could be used in a debugging or logging scenario to inspect or log the first invocation details in a sequence of operations.
