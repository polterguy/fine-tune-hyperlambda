/*
 * // The code demonstrates the use of the [switch] slot in Hyperlambda to execute conditional logic based on the value of a node. The [switch] slot evaluates the value of the [.val] node and executes the first matching [case] node. If no [case] matches, the [default] node is executed. This allows for branching logic similar to switch/case statements in traditional programming languages. The code also illustrates how to handle scenarios where no case matches by using a [default] node.
 * // 1. [.val] - A node with a value that the [switch] statement evaluates.
 * // 2. [.result] - A node where the result of the switch case execution is stored.
 * // 3. [switch] - A slot that evaluates the value of the [.val] node and executes the first matching [case] node.
 * // 4. [case:bar] - A case node that checks if the value of [.val] is "bar" and sets the [.result] node to "Oops" if true.
 * // 5. [case:foo] - A case node that checks if the value of [.val] is "foo" and sets the [.result] node to "Success!" if true.
 * // 6. [default] - A node executed if none of the [case] nodes match the value of [.val], setting the [.result] node to "Success!".
