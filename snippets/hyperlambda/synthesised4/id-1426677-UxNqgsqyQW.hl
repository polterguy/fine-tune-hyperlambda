 * // This Hyperlambda code calculates a future date by adding a time span to the current date and time. 
 * // It uses the [math.add] slot to perform the addition operation. 
 * // The [date.now] slot retrieves the current date and time, while the [time] slot creates a time span of 7 days. 
 * // The result is a date and time object representing the current date and time plus 7 days.
 * //
 * // 1. [math.add] - Adds the current date and time with a specified time span.
 * // 2. [date.now] - Retrieves the current date and time.
 * // 3. [time] - Creates a time span of 7 days to be added to the current date and time.
