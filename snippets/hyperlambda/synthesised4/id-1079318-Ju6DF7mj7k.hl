/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint. In the context of Hyperlambda, this is often the starting point for retrieving input parameters.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or endpoint, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `/offset` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `offset`. It is used to specifically retrieve the value of the `offset` argument from the list of all arguments.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function or endpoint to retrieve the value of an `offset` parameter, which might be used for pagination or to determine a starting point in a list or sequence.
