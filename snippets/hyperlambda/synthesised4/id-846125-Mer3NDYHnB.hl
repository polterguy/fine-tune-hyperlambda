// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda, which executes a block of code when a preceding [if] condition evaluates to false. In this example, it logs a message indicating a successful OpenAI invocation using [log.info] and then decrements the value of the [iterations] node by 1 using [math.decrement].
else
   log.info:Invoking OpenAI was a success
   math.decrement:x:@.iterations
