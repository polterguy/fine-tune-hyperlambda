// The Hyperlambda code uses the [remove-nodes] slot to delete all nodes that match the expression provided. In this case, it removes nodes named "distinct_column" that are children of the [.arguments] node. This operation is useful for cleaning up or modifying a node structure by eliminating specific nodes based on their names.
