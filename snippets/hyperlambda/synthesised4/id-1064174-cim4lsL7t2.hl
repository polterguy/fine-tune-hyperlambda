/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot, and is often found at the beginning of expressions to locate the arguments node in a Hyperlambda file or dynamic slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node, which in this case is the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `aggregate_function` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "aggregate_function" from the previously selected nodes (children of the "arguments" node). It is used to specifically access the "aggregate_function" argument passed to the function or slot.
