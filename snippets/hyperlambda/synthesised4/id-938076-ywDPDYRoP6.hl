// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "orders" and "customers", based on a matching condition where the "customer_id" from the "orders" table is equal to the "id" from the "customers" table. The [join] slot specifies the type of join as "left", ensuring that all records from the "orders" table are returned, along with matching records from the "customers" table, if any. The [and] and [eq] slots are used to define the join condition.
