/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by finding the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It uses the `@` symbol to search for a node with the specified name.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node. It allows access to each child node under the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `group_column` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "group_column" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It ensures that only nodes specifically named "group_column" are selected.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is useful for accessing a specific node named "group_column" within the children of an "arguments" node. It is often used in scenarios where you need to retrieve or manipulate data associated with a particular argument in a structured data set, such as in a function or an API call where "group_column" is a parameter or configuration setting.
