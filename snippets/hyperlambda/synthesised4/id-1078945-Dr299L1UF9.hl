/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "signal" in the current hierarchy. It starts from the current node's position and moves upwards through the hierarchy until it finds a node named "signal". This is useful for locating a specific node in a nested structure, especially when you know the node's name but not its exact position.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. It is used to access the immediate children of a node, allowing you to perform operations on or retrieve information from these child nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `cached` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "cached" from the children of the "signal" node. It is useful for narrowing down the search to specific nodes of interest, especially when dealing with multiple child nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a caching mechanism where you need to access or manipulate cached data associated with a specific signal.
 * - It can also be useful in scenarios where you are monitoring or logging specific events or signals and need to retrieve cached information related to those signals.
