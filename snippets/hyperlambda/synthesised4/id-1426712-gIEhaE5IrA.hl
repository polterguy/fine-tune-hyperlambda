// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database and executes a SQL query to retrieve prompts and their maximum completion values from the "ml_requests" table, filtered by a specific user ID, questionnaire, and context. The results are grouped by prompt. For each result, it processes the data to add entries to a session, alternating between assistant and user roles, and using the prompt and completion data for the content.
