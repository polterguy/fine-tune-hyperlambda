// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to perform a SQL read operation on an SQLite database, specifically targeting the "EmployeeTerritories" table. It includes a left join with the "Employees" table, using the "EmployeeID" as an alias. The query selects distinct values with an alias "count" and includes a placeholder for additional "where" conditions using logical "and" operators. The use of "distinct_functor" suggests a custom function or placeholder for distinct aggregation.
