// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] slot to evaluate two conditions. It retrieves the values of [.token-valid] and [.password-valid] using [get-value], and returns true only if both conditions are true. This is useful for scenarios where multiple conditions must be satisfied simultaneously, such as validating both a token and a password in an authentication process.
