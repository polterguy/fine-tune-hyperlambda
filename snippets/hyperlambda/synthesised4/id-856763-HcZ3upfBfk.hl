// The code snippet uses the [add] slot to append a node with a [finish_reason] child to the [result] node. The [finish_reason] node's value is set to the first non-null value obtained from the [get-first-value] slot. This operation is useful for appending dynamic data to a result set, ensuring that only the first valid value is used.
