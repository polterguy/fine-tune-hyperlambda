// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read specific columns from a database table using the [data.read] slot. It selects the "twilio_account_id" and "twilio_account_sid" columns from the "ml_types" table, applying a [where] condition to filter the results based on the "type" argument passed in. The [where] condition uses the [and] logical operator and the [eq] comparison to ensure that only rows where the "type" column matches the provided argument are returned.
