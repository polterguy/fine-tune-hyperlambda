 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node in the current context with the specified name. In this case, it looks for the first node named `.sql`. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by its name within the current context, such as retrieving SQL query details or parameters stored under the `.sql` node.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to access a node containing SQL query information or configuration settings related to SQL operations within a larger Hyperlambda script.
