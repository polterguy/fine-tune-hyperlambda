/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before it in the hierarchy that matches the specified name. In this case, it looks for the first node named "database-type". This is useful for quickly accessing a specific node by name without traversing all siblings or children.
 * 2. `.database-type` - This specifies the name of the node to be retrieved. It is used in conjunction with the `@` iterator to find the node named "database-type". This is useful when you need to access a particular node's value or manipulate it in some way.
