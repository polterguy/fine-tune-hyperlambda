/*
 * 1. `@.anchor`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "anchor" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will return the first occurrence of a node named "anchor" it finds. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node that serves as a marker or anchor point in your node structure, allowing you to easily navigate back to it regardless of your current position in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used in scenarios where you have a complex node structure and need to frequently reference a particular node that acts as a key point or starting point for further operations, such as configuration settings or a specific data segment.
