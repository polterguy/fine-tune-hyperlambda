// This Hyperlambda code checks if the value of the [.vectorize] node is true using the [eq] slot. If true, it executes the [.lambda] block, which first uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate all expressions in the current context. Then, it sends a signal to the [magic.ai.vectorise] slot with the [type] and [feedback-channel] values being dynamically retrieved from their respective nodes. This setup is useful for conditionally triggering AI vectorization processes based on specific conditions.
