// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else-if] slot to evaluate a compound condition involving two [eq] checks. The condition checks if the user's role is "moderator" and if a feature is enabled. If both conditions are true, it sets the value of the [access] node to "Limited Access Granted". The [and] slot ensures both conditions must be true for the [else-if] block to execute.
