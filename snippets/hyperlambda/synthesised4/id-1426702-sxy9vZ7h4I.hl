 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet converts a lambda object resulting from an HTTP GET request into a Hyperlambda string representation. The [lambda2hyper] slot is used to transform the lambda object, which is pointed to by the expression [@http.get], into a textual Hyperlambda format. This allows for easy transfer or storage of the lambda object as a string.
 * // 
 * // 1. [lambda2hyper] - Converts the lambda object to a Hyperlambda string.
 * // 2. [x:@http.get] - Points to the lambda object resulting from an HTTP GET request to be converted.
