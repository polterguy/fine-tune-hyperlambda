// 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name that appears before the current node in the hierarchy. In this case, it looks for a node named "check" that is an ancestor or a sibling of the current node. This is useful for accessing nodes that are defined earlier in the structure, allowing you to reference and utilize their values or children in your current context.
