// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else-if] slot to evaluate a condition. It checks if the value of the [zone] node is equal to "B" using the [eq] slot. If the condition is true, it executes the lambda block within [.lambda], setting the value of the [orderStatus] node to "Standard shipping" using the [set-value] slot.
