// The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates various logical comparison slots such as [mt], [lte], [lt], [mte], [eq], and [neq], which are used to compare integer values and return boolean results based on specific conditions. These slots are essential for implementing conditional logic in Hyperlambda, allowing developers to execute code based on dynamic comparisons of integer values.
