/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet trims leading and trailing whitespace from the first element of a split string result and sets it back to the original position. It uses the [set-value] slot to update the value of the first element in the [strings.split] node set, after removing any spaces from its start and end using [strings.trim]. The process involves the following steps:
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Updates the value of a specified node.
 * 2. [strings.split/0] - References the first element of a node set resulting from a previous string split operation.
 * 3. [strings.trim] - Trims whitespace from both ends of a string.
 * 4. [strings.split/0] - Specifies the target node for trimming.
 * 5. [.] - Contains the characters to be trimmed, in this case, a space character.
