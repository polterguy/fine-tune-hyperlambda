// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database named "appdb" and reads data from the "users" table. It selects the "name" and "email" columns where the "id" column matches a specified user ID provided as an argument. The [data.connect] slot establishes the database connection, [data.read] specifies the table and columns to retrieve, and the [where] clause filters the results based on the user ID.
