/*
 * 1. `@.result` - This iterator searches for the first node named "result" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is useful for accessing specific nodes in a structured data set, especially when you know the node's name but not its exact location.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children of the "result" node. It is useful when you want to access or manipulate all direct descendants of a particular node without knowing their names.
 * 
 * 3. `db_time` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to only include those named "db_time". It is useful for pinpointing specific nodes when you are interested in a particular type of data or attribute.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting database timestamps from a result set to log or display them.
 * - Filtering out specific timing information from a larger dataset for analysis or reporting.
