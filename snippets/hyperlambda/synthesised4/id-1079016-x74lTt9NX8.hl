 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It searches upwards and across siblings to find the node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access session-related data or variables that are stored in a node named "session" within a Hyperlambda script. This is useful for retrieving session-specific information such as user authentication status, session ID, or other session-related parameters.
