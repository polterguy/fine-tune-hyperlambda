// 1. `@.session`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "session" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it should start the search from the current node. This expression is useful for retrieving session-related data or configurations within a Hyperlambda execution context, where session information is stored in a node named "session". A potential use case might be to access user session data, such as user preferences or authentication tokens, stored in a session node.
