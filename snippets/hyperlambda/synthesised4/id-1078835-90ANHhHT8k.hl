/*
 * 1. `@.buffer`: This iterator starts by locating the first node named `.buffer` in the current context. It is used to pinpoint the starting node for further traversal. A potential use case is when you have a structured data set and want to begin processing or querying from a specific node named `.buffer`.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: The first asterisk retrieves all children nodes of the `.buffer` node. This is useful when you want to process or analyze all direct children of a specific node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: The second asterisk retrieves all children nodes of each node retrieved by the previous `*`. This allows for deeper traversal into the hierarchy, accessing grandchildren nodes of the `.buffer` node.
 * 
 * 4. `*`: The third asterisk retrieves all children nodes of each node retrieved by the second `*`. This further deepens the traversal, allowing access to great-grandchildren nodes.
 * 
 * 5. `operationId`: This final iterator filters the nodes retrieved by the previous `*` to only include those named `operationId`. This is useful for extracting specific data points or attributes, such as operation identifiers, from a deeply nested structure.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include extracting operation IDs from a complex data structure where these IDs are nested several levels deep, such as in a log file or a configuration file with multiple layers of nested operations.
