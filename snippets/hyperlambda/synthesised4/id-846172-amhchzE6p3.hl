// This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [strings.replace] slot to replace occurrences of the string " unsigned" with an empty string in the result of a previous [strings.regex-replace] operation. The [strings.replace] slot takes two arguments: the first is the substring to find, and the second is the replacement string. Here, it effectively removes " unsigned" from the processed string. The code showcases how to chain string manipulation slots to achieve complex transformations.
