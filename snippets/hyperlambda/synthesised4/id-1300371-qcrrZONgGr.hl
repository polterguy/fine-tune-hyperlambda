// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet is designed to read data from a SQLite database, specifically from the "Customers" table. It uses the [data.read] slot to perform this operation. The code specifies a column named "aggregate_functor" and assigns it an alias "result". This implies that some aggregate function is being applied to the data, and its result will be stored under the alias "result". The [where] clause is present with an [and] slot, suggesting that conditions can be added to filter the data, although no specific conditions are provided in this snippet. The [limit] is set to 1, indicating that only one record will be returned from the query. Finally, the [return-nodes] slot is used to return the nodes resulting from the [data.read] operation, effectively outputting the data retrieved from the database. This setup is useful for retrieving a single aggregated result from a database table.
