/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node in the current hierarchy with the name "session". It starts from the current node and looks upwards through its ancestors, including the current node itself, until it finds a node named "session". 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to access session-related data or configurations in a Hyperlambda application, such as user session information or session variables, which are often stored in a node named "session".
