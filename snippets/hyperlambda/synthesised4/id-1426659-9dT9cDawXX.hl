// The [unwrap] slot in Hyperlambda is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. In this example, [unwrap] is applied to the expression "x:+/*/*", which means it will evaluate the expression to retrieve the relevant nodes or values before proceeding with the rest of the Hyperlambda code. This allows for "forward evaluation" of expressions within a lambda object, ensuring that the desired nodes or values are available for subsequent operations.
unwrap:x:+/*/*
