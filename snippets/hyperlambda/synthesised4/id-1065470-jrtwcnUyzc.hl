// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" within the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name, and the `.` before `sql` specifies that it is looking for a direct child node of the current node. This is useful when you need to access a specific node named "sql" that is a direct child of the node you are currently working within.
