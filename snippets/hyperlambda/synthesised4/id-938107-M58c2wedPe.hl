// This Hyperlambda code sets the value of the node referenced by [.full-path] to the concatenated result of two values: the value of the [folder] node inside [.arguments], and the value of the [name] node inside the [file] node, also within [.arguments]. It uses [strings.concat] to join these values, effectively constructing a full file path.
