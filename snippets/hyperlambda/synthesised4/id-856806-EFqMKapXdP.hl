// This Hyperlambda code appends a comma and a newline to the existing SQL string if the preceding conditions are false. The [else] slot executes its child nodes when no previous [if] or [else-if] conditions are met. The [set-value] slot updates the [sql] node's value by concatenating its current value with a comma and newline using [strings.concat]. The [get-value] slot retrieves the current value of the [sql] node to be used in the concatenation process.
