/*
 * The [join] slot in Hyperlambda synchronizes the execution of multiple [fork] slots, ensuring that the main process waits until all forked processes have completed. This allows for parallel execution of tasks, such as making HTTP requests, and then consolidating their results back into the main execution flow. 
 * 
 * 1. [join] - Waits for all child [fork] invocations to complete.
 * 2. [fork] - Executes a task in parallel, such as an HTTP GET request, allowing for concurrent operations.
