// The [unwrap] slot evaluates a complex expression before the node it references is reached, allowing for forward evaluation. In this example, the expression [x:+/*/*/*] is unwrapped, which traverses the node graph to evaluate and replace the node's value with the result of the expression. This is useful for dynamically determining node values based on the current state of the node graph.
unwrap:x:+/*/*/*
