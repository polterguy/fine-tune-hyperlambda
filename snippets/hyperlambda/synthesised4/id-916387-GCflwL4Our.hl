// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [if] slot to conditionally execute a block of code. It checks if the value of the [foo] node within the [.arguments] node is true. If the condition is met, it sets the value of the [dest] node to "yup!" using the [set-value] slot. The [get-value] slot retrieves the value of the [foo] node to evaluate the condition.
if
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/foo
   .lambda
      set-value:x:@.dest
         .:yup!
