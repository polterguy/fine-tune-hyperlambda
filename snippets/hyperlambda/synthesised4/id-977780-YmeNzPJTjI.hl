// This Hyperlambda code sends an HTTP POST request to the specified URL with a payload containing a JSON object. The payload includes a title, body, and userId, and the response is automatically converted to a lambda object due to the convert argument being set to true. The [http.post] slot facilitates the POST request, while the [payload] node structures the data to be sent.
