/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named [arguments] from the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [arguments] node. It is used to access any arguments that have been passed as children of the [arguments] node.
 * 3. `message` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name [message]. It is used to specifically access the [message] argument if it exists among the children of the [arguments] node.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to access a specific argument named [message] that has been passed to a function or endpoint. For example, it can be used in an HTTP endpoint to retrieve a message parameter from the request.
