// This Hyperlambda code reads data from a SQLite database, specifically from the "Customers" table. It selects the count of rows, aliasing the result as "count". The [where] clause is prepared for conditions, but currently has no specific conditions defined. The [limit] is set to 1, restricting the result to a single record.
