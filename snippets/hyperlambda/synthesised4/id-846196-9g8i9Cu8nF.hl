// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [convert] slot to change the type of a node's value. It specifically converts the value of the [supervised] node, found within the [.arguments] node, to an integer type. The [convert] slot takes an expression pointing to the node to be converted and a [type] argument specifying the desired type. If the conversion is not possible, an exception is thrown.
convert:x:@.arguments/*/supervised
