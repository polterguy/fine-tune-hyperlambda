/*
 * This expression consists of a single iterator:
 * 
 * 1. `@.no`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, checking each ancestor and sibling node until it finds a match. This is useful when you need to reference a specific node that is located earlier in the structure, such as retrieving configuration settings or values that are defined at a higher level in the node hierarchy.
