// The code snippet uses [set-value] to change the value of nodes under [user2] within the [users] node. It retrieves the name of the node using [get-name] and sets its value to the current value of the node being iterated, accessed by [get-value] through [.dp]. This effectively updates each node's value under [user2] with its current name.
