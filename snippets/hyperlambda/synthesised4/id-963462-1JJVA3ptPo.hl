// This Hyperlambda code checks if a user is logged in by evaluating the [eq] slot to see if the [.is-logged-in] node is true. If the condition is met, it sets the value of the [.welcome-message] node to "Welcome back!" using the [set-value] slot. The [if] slot ensures that the welcome message is only updated when the user is logged in.
