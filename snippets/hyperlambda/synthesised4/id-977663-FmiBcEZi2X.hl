// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a SQL query condition using the [and] slot to combine two comparison operations. The first condition checks if [column1] is equal to 42 using the [eq] operator, while the second condition checks if [column2] matches a pattern using the [like] operator with '%example%' as the pattern. This combination is typically used in a [where] clause to filter database query results.

   column1.eq:42
   column2.like:%example%
