// The code adds nodes to a specified location by retrieving nodes from the arguments. It uses [add] to insert nodes at the current path, and [get-nodes] to fetch nodes named "order" and "direction" from the [.arguments] node. This setup is typically used to dynamically add nodes based on input arguments.
add:x:./*/data.read
