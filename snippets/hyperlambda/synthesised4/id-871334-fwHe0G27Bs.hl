/*
 * Connects to a SQLite database named "northwind" and reads from the "Customers" table. It adds nodes from the arguments to the "where" clause of the query. The query counts the number of entries in the "Customers" table, limiting the result to one entry. Finally, it returns the nodes from the data read operation. 
 * 
 * 1. [data.connect] - Establishes a connection to the "northwind" SQLite database.
 * 2. [database-type] - Specifies the database type as SQLite.
 * 3. [add] - Adds nodes from the arguments to the "where" clause.
 * 4. [get-nodes] - Retrieves nodes from the arguments.
 * 5. [data.read] - Reads data from the "Customers" table.
 * 6. [table] - Specifies the table to read from, "Customers".
 * 7. [columns] - Specifies columns to be read, counting entries.
 * 8. [where] - Defines conditions for filtering data.
 * 9. [limit] - Limits the result to one entry.
 * 10. [return-nodes] - Returns nodes from the data read operation.
