/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a node named [_user-id] with a value of "string" exists within the [.arguments] node under the [hyper2lambda] node. If such a node exists, it unwraps the children of the current node and adds a new node named [execute-file] as a sibling, setting its child node [_user-id] with the value from [.arguments/*/user-id]. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Checks a condition and executes its child [.lambda] if true.
 * 2. [exists] - Checks if a specific node exists within a given path.
 * 3. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the [if] condition is true.
 * 4. [unwrap] - Evaluates expressions within the current node's children.
 * 5. [add] - Adds a new node as a sibling to the current node.
 * 6. [_user-id] - Sets the value of the [_user-id] node from the [.arguments/*/user-id] path.
