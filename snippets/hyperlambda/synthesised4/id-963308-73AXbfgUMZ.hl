// This Hyperlambda code connects to a database, adds nodes to a "where" condition for a "data.delete" operation on the "users_roles" table, and executes the delete operation. It then unwraps the result and returns the number of affected rows. The process involves dynamically constructing the "where" clause using nodes from the arguments.
