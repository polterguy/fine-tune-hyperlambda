// The code snippet demonstrates how to set the value of a node by concatenating strings. It uses [set-value] to change the value of the [.url] node. The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate the values retrieved by [get-value] from [.domain] and the current node referenced by [.dp]. The concatenated result is then assigned to the [.url] node.
set-value:x:@.url
   strings.concat
      get-value:x:@.domain
      get-value:x:@.dp/#
