/*
 * 1. `@crypto.rsa.create-key` - This iterator finds the first node with the name "crypto.rsa.create-key". It is used to locate the starting point for further navigation within the node structure. This is useful when you want to begin your search from a specific node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "crypto.rsa.create-key" node. It allows you to access each child node directly under the specified parent node. This is helpful when you need to perform operations or checks on all immediate descendants of a node.
 * 
 * 3. `fingerprint` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "fingerprint" among the children of "crypto.rsa.create-key". It is used to pinpoint specific nodes by name within a collection of nodes, which is useful for extracting or manipulating data associated with a particular node.
