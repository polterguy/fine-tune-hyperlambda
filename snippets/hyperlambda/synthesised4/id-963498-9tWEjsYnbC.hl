// This Hyperlambda code attempts to convert the value of the node referenced by the expression [@.src] to a type specified as "non-existing-type" using the [convert] slot. Since "non-existing-type" is not a valid type, this operation will likely result in an exception being thrown due to the inability to perform the conversion. The [convert] slot is used to change the data type of a node's value, but it requires a valid type that supports conversion from the original type.
convert:x:@.src
   type:non-existing-type
