// This Hyperlambda code appends a newline character to the existing value of a node. It uses [set-value] to change the value of the node located at [.snippets/0/-/*/completion] by concatenating its current value with a newline character using [strings.concat]. The [get-value] retrieves the current value of the node, and the [.] node contains the newline character to be appended.
