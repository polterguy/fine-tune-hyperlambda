// 1. `@.fields`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "fields" that is found before the current node in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings but looks for the node in the current node's ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is located higher up in the hierarchy, such as configuration settings or shared data that is relevant to multiple parts of your Hyperlambda code.
