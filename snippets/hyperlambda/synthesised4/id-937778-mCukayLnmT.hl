// This Hyperlambda code uses the [for-each] slot to iterate over all child nodes of [.foo1] that are located two levels up from the current node. For each node in the iteration, it performs an operation that involves a node named [foo2]. The [for-each] slot allows you to execute a lambda object for each node in the result set, passing the currently iterated node by reference.
