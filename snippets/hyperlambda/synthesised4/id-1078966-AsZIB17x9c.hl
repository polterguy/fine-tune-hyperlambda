/*
 * 1. `@.token`: This iterator searches for the first node named "token" within the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node's siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you need to access a specific node named "token" that might be a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases: 
 * - Retrieving an authentication token stored in a parent node or a sibling node for use in API requests.
 * - Accessing configuration or session data stored in a node named "token" that is part of a larger data structure.
