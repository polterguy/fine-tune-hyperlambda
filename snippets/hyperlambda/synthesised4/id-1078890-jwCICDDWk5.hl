/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.dp` in the current context. It is often used to access a specific node that holds data or a reference to another node, commonly used in loops or dynamic processing.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator dereferences the value of the `.dp` node, assuming the value is a node itself. It allows you to access and manipulate the node that is referenced by the value of `.dp`.
 * 
 * 3. `**` - This iterator retrieves all descendant nodes of the current node, including the node itself. It is useful for searching through an entire subtree to find specific nodes or values.
 * 
 * 4. `\#text` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name `#text`. It is typically used to extract text content from nodes, especially in contexts like XML or HTML parsing.
 * 
 * 5. `[0,1]` - This iterator retrieves a subset of the result set, specifically the first node in the set. It is useful when you only need a single node from a list of nodes, such as when you expect only one match or want to process the first occurrence.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting the text content of a specific node in a document or data structure, especially when dealing with XML or HTML where text nodes are common.
 * - Accessing and processing the first text node in a dynamically generated or complex data structure for further operations or transformations.
