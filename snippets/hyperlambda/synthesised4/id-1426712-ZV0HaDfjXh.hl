// // This Hyperlambda code checks if any child node of the [.arguments] node with the name [prefix] has a value. If at least one such node exists with a non-null value, the [not-null] slot will evaluate to true. This is useful for ensuring that a required argument or data segment is present and has a value before proceeding with further operations. The expression used in [not-null] targets the [prefix] node within the [.arguments] node, evaluating its presence and value status.
