/*
 * This Hyperlambda code dynamically sets HTTP response headers based on the file type specified in [.fileType]. It uses a [switch] statement to check the file type and sets the [Content-Type] and [Content-Disposition] headers accordingly. The [case] slots handle specific file types like JSON, XML, and CSV, setting appropriate MIME types and filenames. The [default] case handles any unspecified file types, setting them as binary streams. This ensures that the correct headers are applied for file downloads based on the file type. 
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Checks the value of [.fileType] to determine the file type.
 * 2. [case] - Handles specific file types (json, xml, csv) by setting appropriate headers.
 * 3. [response.headers.set] - Sets the Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers for the response.
 * 4. [default] - Provides a fallback for unspecified file types, setting them as binary streams.
