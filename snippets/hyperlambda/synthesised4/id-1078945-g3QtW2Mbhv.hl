/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda graph, which is often used to pass parameters or data into a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "arguments" node. It is used to access each individual argument node within the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `type` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "type" among the children of the "arguments" node. This is useful for accessing specific argument types when processing or validating input data.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function to validate or process input arguments by checking their types, ensuring that the correct data types are being used for further operations.
 * - It could also be used in a logging or debugging context to output or verify the types of arguments being passed into a function or slot.
