/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet appends a formatted string to the value of the [.completion] node. It uses [strings.concat] to concatenate the current value of [.completion] with a new string that includes a newline character, an exclamation mark, the name of a node, and its source, all enclosed in parentheses. The [get-value] slots are used to retrieve the current value of [.completion], the name, and the source of the node referenced by [.dp]. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the [.completion] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple strings into one.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.completion] - Retrieves the current value of [.completion].
 * 4. [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/name] - Retrieves the name of a node.
 * 5. [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/src] - Retrieves the source of a node.
