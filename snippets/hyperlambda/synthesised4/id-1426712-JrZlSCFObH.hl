// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [neq] slot to check if the value of the node referenced by the expression `@.arguments/*/data` is not equal to an empty value. The [neq] slot is used for inequality comparison, and it requires two arguments. In this case, the first argument is the value of the node found at the specified path, and the second argument is an empty value. If the value of the node is not equal to an empty value, the [neq] slot will evaluate to true.
