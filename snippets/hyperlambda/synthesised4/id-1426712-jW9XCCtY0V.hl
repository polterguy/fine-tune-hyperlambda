/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if the [data] node exists, is not null, and is not equal to an empty string in the [.arguments] node. If all these conditions are true, it executes a lambda object that unwraps the content from a deeply nested node structure and adds a new node to the [.session] node with a [role] of "user" and the [content] from the [data] node.
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Begins a conditional block that executes its child nodes if the condition is true.
 * 2. [and] - Combines multiple conditions that must all be true for the block to execute.
 * 3. [exists] - Checks if the [data] node exists in the [.arguments] node.
 * 4. [not-null] - Checks if the [data] node is not null.
 * 5. [neq] - Checks if the [data] node is not equal to an empty string.
 * 6. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * 7. [unwrap] - Unwraps the content from a deeply nested node structure.
 * 8. [add] - Adds a new node to the [.session] node.
 * 9. [role] - Specifies the role of the new node as "user".
 * 10. [content] - Sets the content of the new node to the value of the [data] node.
