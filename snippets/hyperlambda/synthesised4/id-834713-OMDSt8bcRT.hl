// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a database table named "Album" using the [data.read] slot. It includes a [where] clause to filter the results, specifically selecting records where the "ArtistId" column in the "Album" table matches the "ArtistId" value from a dynamically referenced node. The [and] slot is used to combine conditions, and the [.dp] node is used to reference the current data point in a loop or iteration context.
