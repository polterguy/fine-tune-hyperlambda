/*
 * This expression is a Hyperlambda expression that is used to navigate and retrieve a specific node within a Hyperlambda object. Below is a breakdown of each part of the expression:
 * 
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This part of the expression starts by locating the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol is used to find the first occurrence of a node with the specified name, which in this case is `.arguments`. This node is typically used to define the arguments for a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - The asterisk (`*`) is a wildcard iterator that retrieves all children of the `.arguments` node. This means it will select all nodes that are direct children of the `.arguments` node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `/limit` - This part of the expression filters the previously retrieved nodes to find the first child node with the name `limit`. It effectively narrows down the selection to only those nodes named `limit` that are children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * 
 * - Retrieving the value of a `limit` argument passed to a Hyperlambda function or slot, which might be used to control pagination or the number of items to process.
 * - Validating or processing the `limit` parameter in an HTTP endpoint to ensure that the client does not request more data than allowed by the server's policy.
