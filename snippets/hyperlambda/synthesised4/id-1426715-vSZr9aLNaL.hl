// The code demonstrates the use of the [case] slot in Hyperlambda, which is used in conjunction with the [switch] slot to execute different code blocks based on the value of a specified expression. The [case] slot allows for conditional branching, where each [case] node represents a potential match for the expression's value. If a match is found, the corresponding code block is executed. This structure is similar to a switch-case statement in other programming languages, providing a way to handle multiple potential execution paths based on distinct values.
