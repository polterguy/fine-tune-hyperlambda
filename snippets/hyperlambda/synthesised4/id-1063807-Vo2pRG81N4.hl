/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name that follows it. In this case, it looks for the first node named "database-type" in the current context or hierarchy.
 * 2. `.database-type` - This is the name of the node that the `@` iterator is searching for. It specifies that the expression should locate the first occurrence of a node named "database-type". 
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is used when you need to find and possibly manipulate or retrieve the value of a node named "database-type" within the current execution context. This is useful in scenarios where the configuration or type of a database is stored in a node, and you need to access this information for further processing or decision-making in your Hyperlambda code.
