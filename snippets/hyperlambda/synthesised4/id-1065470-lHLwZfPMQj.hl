// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator looks for the first node named "sql" in the current context. It starts from the current node and searches upwards through the hierarchy, including the current node's siblings and parents. This is useful when you need to access a specific node by name that might be located at the same level or higher in the node structure. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and `.sql` specifies the exact name of the node it is searching for. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you have SQL queries or commands stored in a node named "sql" and you need to retrieve or manipulate them.
