/*
 * 1. `@.prop` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "prop" that is a sibling or an ancestor of the current node. It is used to locate the starting point for further navigation within the node structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "prop" node. It is used to access the next level of nodes within the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of each node found by the previous `*` iterator. It is used to delve deeper into the hierarchy to access the next level of nodes.
 * 
 * 4. `type` - This iterator filters the nodes retrieved by the previous iterators to only include those with the name "type". It is used to specifically target nodes that are named "type" within the hierarchy.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to extract the "type" information from a complex data structure where the "type" nodes are nested within multiple layers of children under a "prop" node. 
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you need to validate or process specific types of data within a configuration or data model that is organized hierarchically.
