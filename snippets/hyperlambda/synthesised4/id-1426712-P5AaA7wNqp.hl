// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [get-nodes] slot to retrieve a set of nodes specified by its expression. In this example, the expression is pointing to all child nodes of the [.data] node, effectively returning the nodes "foo1" and "foo2". This operation allows for the extraction of specific nodes within a Hyperlambda structure based on the provided expression, enabling further manipulation or inspection of these nodes.
