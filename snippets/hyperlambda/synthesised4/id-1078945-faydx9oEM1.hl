/*
 * 1. `@.arguments`: This iterator looks for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot, especially in Hyperlambda where arguments are often organized under a `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each individual argument node that is a direct child of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `type`: This iterator filters the result set to include only those nodes that have the name `type`. It is used to specifically target nodes that define a type within the arguments, which can be useful for validation or processing based on the type of arguments provided.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in a scenario where you need to validate or process arguments based on their type. For example, in a dynamic slot or an HTTP endpoint, you might want to ensure that all arguments have a specified type before proceeding with further logic.
 * - It can also be used to dynamically generate documentation or logs that include the types of arguments being used, which can be helpful for debugging or auditing purposes.
