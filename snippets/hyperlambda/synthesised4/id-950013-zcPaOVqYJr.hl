// The code snippet demonstrates how to perform an inner join between two tables, `film_actor` and `actor`, using the `actor_id` column as the joining key. The [join] slot specifies the table to join, the [type] slot indicates the type of join (inner join in this case), and the [on] slot defines the condition for the join, using the [and] slot to ensure both columns match.
