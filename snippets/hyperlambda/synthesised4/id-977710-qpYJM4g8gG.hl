// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [add] slot to append nodes from multiple sources to multiple destination nodes. The [add] slot targets all [.dest] nodes in the parent directory and appends nodes retrieved from [.alias-source] using [get-nodes]. This operation effectively duplicates the children of [.alias-source] into each [.dest] node, showcasing how [add] can handle multiple destinations and sources simultaneously.
