// The provided Hyperlambda code uses the [join] slot to concurrently execute multiple [fork] slots, each performing an HTTP GET request to different URLs. The [join] slot ensures that the execution waits for all [fork] operations to complete before proceeding, effectively synchronizing the results of the HTTP requests into the original node structure.
