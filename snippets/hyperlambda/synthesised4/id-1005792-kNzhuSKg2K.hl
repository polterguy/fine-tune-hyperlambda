/*
 * 1. `@data.read`: This iterator searches for the first node named `data.read` in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards through the hierarchy, looking for a node with this specific name. This is useful when you want to access a specific node that might be located at different levels in the hierarchy, ensuring that you get the first occurrence of `data.read`.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all the children of the node found by the previous iterator (`@data.read`). It is used to access all the immediate child nodes of `data.read`, allowing you to perform operations or extract information from each of these children. This is particularly useful when you need to process or evaluate multiple nodes that are directly under a specific parent node.
