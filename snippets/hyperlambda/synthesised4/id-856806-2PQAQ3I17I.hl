/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet appends the length of a node to an existing SQL string. It uses [set-value] to modify the value of the [.sql] node by concatenating its current value with a parenthesis, the length of a node obtained through [get-value], and a closing parenthesis. The [strings.concat] slot is used to concatenate these parts into a single string. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Modifies the value of the [.sql] node.
 * 2. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple string parts into one.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.sql] - Retrieves the current value of the [.sql] node.
 * 4. [.:(] - Adds an opening parenthesis to the concatenated string.
 * 5. [get-value:x:@.dp/#/*/length] - Retrieves the length of a node.
 * 6. [.:)] - Adds a closing parenthesis to the concatenated string.
