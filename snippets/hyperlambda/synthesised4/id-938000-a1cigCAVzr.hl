// The code snippet demonstrates the creation of a database transaction using [data.transaction.create], followed by executing a SQL delete operation on the "film_actor" table using [data.execute]. The transaction is not committed, implying that changes will be rolled back by default unless explicitly committed before the transaction scope ends.
data.transaction.create
   data.execute:delete from film_actor
