/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named [.arguments] starting from the current node and moving upwards through the hierarchy. It is commonly used to access the arguments node in Hyperlambda, especially when dealing with HTTP endpoints or dynamic slots where arguments are passed.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of [.arguments].
 * 
 * 3. `domain` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named [domain]. It is used to specifically target the [domain] argument node among the children of [.arguments].
