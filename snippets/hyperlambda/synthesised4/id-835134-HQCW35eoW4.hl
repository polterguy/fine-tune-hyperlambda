// The [endpoints.list] slot retrieves and returns metadata about all HTTP endpoints in the system. It semantically traverses the endpoints, loading Hyperlambda files from disk, and provides information such as HTTP verb, URL, arguments, and descriptions. This allows for easy documentation and testing of endpoints within the Magic dashboard.
