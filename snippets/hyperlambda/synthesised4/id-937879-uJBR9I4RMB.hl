// The Hyperlambda code uses the [whitelist] slot to restrict the available slots to [return] and [vocabulary] within a specific scope. Inside this scope, it sets the value of [.foo] to "foo", retrieves the system's vocabulary, and returns the result. The [whitelist] ensures that only the specified slots can be executed, enhancing security by limiting the operations that can be performed.
