// This code uses the [and] slot to evaluate multiple conditions: it checks if the [data] node exists and is not null using [exists] and [not-null], respectively. Additionally, it uses [neq] to ensure the [data] node's value is not equal to an empty string. All conditions must be true for the [and] slot to evaluate to true.
