/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot to determine the Hyperlambda type of a node. It first assigns an integer value to a node named [.foo] and then uses the [type] slot to retrieve the type name of the node's value. The [type] slot is executed with an expression pointing to the node, and after execution, it returns the type name, which in this case would be "int" for the [.foo] node.
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the Hyperlambda type name of the node's value.
 * 3. [x:-] - Expression used to point to the node whose type is being retrieved.
