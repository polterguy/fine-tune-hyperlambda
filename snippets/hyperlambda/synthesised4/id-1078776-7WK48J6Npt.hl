/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` in the current scope. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda structure, which is often used to pass parameters to a function or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any parameters or arguments that are passed as children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `body` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `body`. It is used to specifically access the `body` node among the children of `.arguments`, which might represent the main content or payload of a request or function call.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - Accessing the body of an HTTP request in a web service endpoint to process or validate the incoming data.
 * - Retrieving the main content of a message or command passed to a Hyperlambda function for further processing or manipulation.
