// The code snippet changes the names of all nodes referenced by its main expression to the value retrieved from the [get-name] slot. The [set-name] slot targets nodes using a lambda expression, while [get-name] retrieves the name of the node it references. This combination allows dynamic renaming of nodes based on their current names.
