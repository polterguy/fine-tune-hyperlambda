// 1. `@.fingerprint`: This iterator searches for the first node named "fingerprint" within the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary, but does not traverse siblings. This is useful when you need to retrieve a specific node that might be a direct child or located higher up in the hierarchy, ensuring you get the closest "fingerprint" node in the current execution context.
