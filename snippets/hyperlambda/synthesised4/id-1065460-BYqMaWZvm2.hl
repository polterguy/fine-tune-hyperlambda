/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" from the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it looks for a node by name, and ".dp" specifies the exact name it is searching for. This is useful when you need to access a specific node that is expected to be present in the current execution context, often used in loops or conditional statements where ".dp" might represent a data point or a reference node.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is, in fact, another node, and it returns this node by reference. This is particularly useful when you want to manipulate or access the actual node stored as a value in another node, allowing you to perform operations directly on the referenced node rather than a copy.
