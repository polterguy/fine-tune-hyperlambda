/*
 * 1. `@.tmp`: This iterator searches for the first node named "tmp" within the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the name "tmp". This is useful for locating a specific node when you know its name and it exists somewhere in the hierarchy above the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the node found by the previous iterator. It is used to access all direct descendants of the "tmp" node. This is useful when you want to perform operations on or analyze all child nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving and processing all child nodes of a specific node named "tmp" to perform batch operations or transformations.
 * - Collecting data from all direct descendants of a configuration or data node named "tmp" for further analysis or reporting.
