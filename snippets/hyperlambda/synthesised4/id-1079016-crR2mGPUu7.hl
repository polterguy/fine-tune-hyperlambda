/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" from the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and it will return the first match it finds. This is useful for accessing session-related data or variables that are stored under a node named "session" within the current execution context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving session-specific data, such as user authentication tokens or session variables, to be used in subsequent operations.
 * - Accessing session configuration settings or metadata that are stored under a "session" node.
