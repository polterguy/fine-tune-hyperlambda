// The code snippet converts the value of the [auth] node to a byte array using the [convert] slot and then sets this converted byte array back to the [auth] node using the [set-value] slot. The [convert] slot is used to change the type of the node's value, and the [set-value] slot updates the node's value with the result of the conversion.
set-value:x:@.auth
   convert:x:@.auth
      type:bytes
