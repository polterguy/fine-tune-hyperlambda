// The [case] node is used within a [switch] block to define specific conditions that, when matched, execute the associated lambda object. The [enum] node is typically used with [validators.enum] to ensure a value is one of a predefined set of legal values. When combined, these can create a robust decision-making structure where specific actions are taken based on the value of an enumerated type.
