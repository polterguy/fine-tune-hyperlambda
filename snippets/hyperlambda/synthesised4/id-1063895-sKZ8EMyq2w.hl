/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It is useful for locating specific nodes in the hierarchy, especially when dealing with structured data or configurations.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access every direct child node, which can be useful when you need to perform operations on or analyze all child nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `columnLength` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `columnLength`. It is used to pinpoint specific nodes among the children, allowing for targeted operations or data retrieval on nodes with this exact name.
