/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator looks for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found `.arguments` node. It is used to access any argument nodes that are direct children of `.arguments`.
 * 
 * 3. `message` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `message`. It is used to specifically access the `message` argument within the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression could include retrieving a specific message argument passed to a function or slot for further processing or validation.
