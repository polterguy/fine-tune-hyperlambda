 * 1. `@http.get`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "http.get" from the current context. It is used to locate the node that represents an HTTP GET request in the Hyperlambda graph.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node, which in this case is the "http.get" node. It is used to access all the nodes that are direct children of the "http.get" node.
 * 
 * 3. `content`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "content" from the previously selected children nodes. It is used to specifically target the node that contains the content of the HTTP GET request.
