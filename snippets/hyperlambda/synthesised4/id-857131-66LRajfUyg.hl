// The code snippet demonstrates how to perform a left join between two tables, "Orders" and "Shippers", using Hyperlambda. The join is aliased as "ShipVia" and matches the "ShipVia" column in the "Orders" table with the "ShipperID" column in the "Shippers" table. This allows for combining related data from both tables based on the specified condition.
join:Shippers
   as:ShipVia
   type:left
   on
      and
         Orders.ShipVia:ShipVia.ShipperID
