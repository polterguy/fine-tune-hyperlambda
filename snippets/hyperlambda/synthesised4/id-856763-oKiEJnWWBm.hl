// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. It sets the value of the [.prompt] node to the value retrieved from the [.arguments/*/prompt] node if none of the preceding conditional branches are true. The [else] slot does not require any condition and directly executes its child nodes.
else
   set-value:x:@.prompt
      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/prompt
