 * // The code snippet uses the [lambda2hyper] slot to convert the result of an HTTP POST request into a Hyperlambda node structure. 
 * // This allows for further manipulation or inspection of the HTTP response within a Hyperlambda context. 
 * // The [lambda2hyper] slot takes an expression pointing to the [http.post] node, which contains the result of the HTTP POST operation, 
 * // and transforms it into a Hyperlambda representation. 
 * // This is useful for scenarios where you need to process or log the HTTP response in a structured format.
 * // 1. [lambda2hyper] - Converts the result of the HTTP POST request into a Hyperlambda node structure.
 * // 2. [x:@http.post] - Expression pointing to the [http.post] node, which contains the HTTP POST request result.
