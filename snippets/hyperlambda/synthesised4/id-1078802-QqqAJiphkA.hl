/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to navigate to the top of the node hierarchy from the current position. This can be useful when you need to access or manipulate nodes that are defined at the root level of the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children of the root node. This is useful for iterating over or accessing all nodes directly under the root node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `http.xxx` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "http.xxx". It is used to find specific nodes that match this name pattern among the children of the root node. This can be useful for accessing or processing nodes related to HTTP operations or configurations that follow a specific naming convention.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - The expression could be used to locate and manipulate HTTP configuration nodes or endpoints defined at the root level of a Hyperlambda file.
 * - It might be used in a scenario where you need to apply a transformation or validation to all HTTP-related nodes in a Hyperlambda structure.
