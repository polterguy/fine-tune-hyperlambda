/*
 * 1. `@data.read`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "data.read" from the current context. This is useful for accessing a specific node that you know exists within the current structure, particularly when you want to start your search from the root or a known point in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children of the "data.read" node. It's used when you want to explore or manipulate all the immediate child nodes of a specific parent node, allowing you to perform operations on each of them.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: This second `*` iterator retrieves all children of each child node of "data.read". This is useful for drilling down two levels deep into the node hierarchy, which can be necessary when dealing with nested data structures where you need to access or modify deeply nested nodes.
 * 
 * 4. `type`: This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named "type". It's used when you need to extract or work with specific nodes that have a particular name, which is common in scenarios where nodes represent different types of data or configurations.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting all "type" nodes from a data structure for processing or validation.
 * - Collecting information about the types of data stored within a nested data structure for reporting or logging purposes.
