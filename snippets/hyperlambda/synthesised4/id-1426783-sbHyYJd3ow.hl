/*
 * This Hyperlambda code converts the children nodes of the [.cache-session] node into a Hyperlambda string using the [lambda2hyper] slot. This allows for the serialization of the [.cache-session] node's contents, which can be useful for transferring data to another server or persisting it to disk. 
 * 
 * 1. [lambda2hyper] - Converts the specified node set into a Hyperlambda string.
 * 2. [x:@.cache-session/*] - Specifies the node set to be converted, which in this case are all children of the [.cache-session] node.
