/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator is used to find the first node with the name "result" in the current context. It starts searching from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings, until it finds a node named "result". This is useful when you need to access or manipulate the value of a node named "result" that is expected to be in the current context or its immediate surroundings. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have multiple calculations or operations, and you want to retrieve the result of a specific operation that is stored in a node named "result".
