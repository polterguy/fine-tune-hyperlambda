/*
 * 1. `@data.read` - This iterator searches for the first node named "data.read" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings, to find the node with this specific name. This is useful for locating a specific node that contains data you want to work with, such as configuration or input data.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "data.read" node. It is used to access the immediate children of a node, which can be useful when you want to process or evaluate multiple nodes that are direct descendants of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * 3. `*` - This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of each node returned by the previous `*` iterator. This effectively allows you to access the grandchildren of the "data.read" node. This is useful when you need to traverse deeper into the node hierarchy to access nested data structures.
 * 
 * 4. `api_key` - This iterator filters the results to only include nodes named "api_key" from the previous result set. It is used to pinpoint specific nodes within a larger set of nodes, especially when you are looking for particular data fields or attributes.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve API keys from a configuration or data file where the keys are stored under a "data.read" node. This is useful in scenarios where you need to programmatically access API keys for authentication purposes in an application.
