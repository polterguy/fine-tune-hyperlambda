/*
 * 1. `@log` - This iterator searches for the first node named "log" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors, until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful for accessing a specific node when you know its name but not its exact location in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `count` - This iterator retrieves a child node named "count" from the result set of the previous iterator. After locating the "log" node, it looks for a child node named "count" within it. This is useful for accessing specific data or properties within a node, such as retrieving a count or total value stored under a specific node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to retrieve the number of log entries or events recorded in a system, assuming the "count" node under "log" holds this information.
 * - It could be used in monitoring or reporting systems to dynamically fetch and display the number of occurrences of a particular event or action.
