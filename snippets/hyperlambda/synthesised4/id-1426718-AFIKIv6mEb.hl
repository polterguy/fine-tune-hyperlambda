/*
 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to add a new node to an existing node set using the [add] slot. It targets a node set specified by the expression in its value, and appends a new node structure to it. The new node structure consists of two child nodes, [prompt] and [completion], each referencing other nodes in the Hyperlambda graph.
 * // 1. [add] - Adds a new node to the node set specified by the expression in its value.
 * // 2. [.] - Represents the new node being added, serving as a container for its children.
 * // 3. [.] - Represents the child node structure to be added under the new node.
 * // 4. [prompt] - A child node referencing the value of the [.file-meta] node.
 * // 5. [completion] - A child node referencing the value of the [.content] node.
