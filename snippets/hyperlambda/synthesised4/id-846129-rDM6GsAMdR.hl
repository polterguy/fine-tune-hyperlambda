// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [remove-nodes] slot to delete nodes from a Hyperlambda structure. It targets nodes within the [json2lambda] node that have the name "_user-id", effectively removing them from the structure. This operation is useful for cleaning up or modifying data structures by eliminating unwanted nodes.
