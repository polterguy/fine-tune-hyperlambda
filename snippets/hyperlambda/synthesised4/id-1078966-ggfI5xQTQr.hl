// 1. `@.max-size`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "max-size" within the current node's siblings and ancestors. It starts from the current node's position and moves upwards in the hierarchy, checking each node's name. If it finds a node named "max-size", it returns that node. This iterator is useful when you need to retrieve configuration or setting values that are defined higher up in the node hierarchy, such as a maximum size limit for a data structure or file.
