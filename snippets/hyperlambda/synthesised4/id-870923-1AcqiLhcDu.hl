// This Hyperlambda code sets a random cryptographically secure string as the value of the [secret] node within a specific path in a JSON structure. It uses the [crypto.random] slot to generate a string with a length between 100 and 200 characters, ensuring a high level of entropy for security purposes. The [set-value] slot assigns this generated string to the specified node, enhancing the security of the authentication configuration.
