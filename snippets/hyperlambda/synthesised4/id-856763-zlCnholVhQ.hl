// This Hyperlambda code checks if there are any nodes within [data.read] and if the [cached] node within these nodes can be converted to an integer and equals 1. It uses [and] to ensure both conditions are true: [exists] verifies the presence of nodes, and [eq] checks the equality after conversion.
