// The [case] slot in Hyperlambda is used within a [switch] construct to define a specific condition or value to match against the evaluated value of the [switch] node. When the value of the [switch] node matches the value of a [case] node, the instructions within that [case] node are executed. The [case] slot must have a value, which can be a constant or an expression, and it is used to determine the execution path within the [switch] block.
