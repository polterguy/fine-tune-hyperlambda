/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named "arguments" from the current context. It is used to locate the starting point for further navigation within the node structure. In the context of an HTTP endpoint, this node typically contains the arguments passed to the endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the "arguments" node. It is used to access each argument passed to the endpoint, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `data` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "data" among the children of the "arguments" node. It is used to specifically target any argument named "data" that might have been passed to the endpoint.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used in an HTTP endpoint to retrieve a specific argument named "data" from the request, allowing the endpoint to process or manipulate this data further.
 * - It can be used to validate or log the "data" argument received in an HTTP request for debugging or auditing purposes.
