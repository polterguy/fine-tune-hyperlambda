// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [data.select] slot to execute a SQL query that selects all records from the "some_table" table. The [data.select] slot allows for executing raw SQL queries against a connected database, returning the results as a lambda object. This approach requires the SQL to match the database's specific dialect, and is useful for retrieving data directly using SQL statements.
data.select:SELECT * FROM some_table
