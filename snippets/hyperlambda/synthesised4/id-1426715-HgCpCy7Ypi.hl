/*
 * The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [case] slot in Hyperlambda, which is used to create a switch-case structure. This allows for conditional execution of code based on the value of a specified node. The [case] slot evaluates its expression and executes the corresponding block of code if the expression matches the given value. The [default] slot is used to define a block of code that executes if none of the [case] conditions are met. This structure is useful for handling multiple potential values and executing different code blocks accordingly.
 * 
 * 1. [switch] - Initiates a switch-case structure to evaluate different conditions.
 * 2. [case] - Defines a condition to be evaluated and executed if it matches the specified value.
 * 3. [default] - Provides a block of code to execute if none of the [case] conditions are met.
