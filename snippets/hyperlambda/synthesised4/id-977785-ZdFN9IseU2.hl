// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] logical operator to combine conditions. It checks if the value of the [customerId] node within [.arguments] is equal to a specified value using the [id.eq] slot. The [and] slot allows for multiple conditions to be evaluated together, ensuring that all conditions must be true for the overall expression to be true. The [id.eq] slot compares the node's value to the provided expression, facilitating conditional logic based on equality.
