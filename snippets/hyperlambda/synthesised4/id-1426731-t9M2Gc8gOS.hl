// This Hyperlambda code snippet pauses the execution of the current thread for 100 milliseconds. The [sleep] slot is used to temporarily halt the thread, allowing other operations to proceed without blocking the system resources. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a brief pause is required between operations to ensure proper sequencing or to reduce CPU usage in a loop. The sleep duration is specified in milliseconds as the value of the [sleep] slot.
sleep:100
