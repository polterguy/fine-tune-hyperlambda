// This Hyperlambda code uses the [data.execute] slot to execute a SQL command that deletes records from two tables, `vss_ml_training_snippets` and `ml_training_snippets`, based on specific conditions. The conditions involve matching the `type` and `uri` values with the provided arguments. The first delete statement removes entries from `vss_ml_training_snippets` where the `rowid` matches the `id` from `ml_training_snippets` with the specified `type` and `uri`. The second delete statement removes entries directly from `ml_training_snippets` with the same conditions. The [data.execute] slot is used because the operation does not require a result to be returned. The [type] and [uri] are dynamically set using values from the current context.
