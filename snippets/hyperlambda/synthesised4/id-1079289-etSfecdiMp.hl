/*
 * This expression is a simple lambda expression in Hyperlambda. Let's break it down:
 * 
 * 1. `@` - This iterator is used to find the first node with the specified name that follows it. In this case, it looks for a node named `.sql`. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors up in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * The expression `.:x:@.sql` is used to reference the first `.sql` node in the current context. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to retrieve or manipulate the value of a node named `.sql`, such as when executing SQL queries or managing database-related operations within a Hyperlambda script.
