/*
 * This Hyperlambda code concatenates parts of a URL. It retrieves the first segment of a split URL, adds "://" as a separator, and then appends the entire first part of the split URL again. This effectively reconstructs a URL from its components. The [strings.concat] slot is used to join these parts into a single string. The code illustrates how to manipulate and reconstruct strings using Hyperlambda's string manipulation slots.
 * 
 * 1. [strings.concat] - Concatenates multiple string segments into a single string.
 * 2. [get-value:x:@strings.split/@strings.split/0] - Retrieves the first part of a previously split URL.
 * 3. [.:"://"] - Adds "://" as a separator in the concatenated string.
 * 4. [get-value:x:@strings.split/0] - Retrieves the entire first part of the split URL again for concatenation.
