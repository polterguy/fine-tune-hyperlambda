/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "dp" that is found in the current scope. The `@` symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and the `.` signifies that it starts the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you want to find a specific node by name within the current execution context.
 * 
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node retrieved by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the "dp" node is another node itself, allowing you to access or modify the original node directly rather than working with a copy. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to manipulate or read the contents of a node that is stored as a value in another node.
