/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a string " END" to the value of the [payload] node within the [http.post] node, which is located as a child of any node in the current context. The [add] slot is used to concatenate the string to the existing value of the [payload] node. The code effectively appends " END" to the payload of an HTTP POST request. 
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Concatenates a string to the value of a specified node.
 * 2. [../*/http.post/*/payload] - Expression pointing to the [payload] node within the [http.post] node.
 * 3. [.] - Represents the value to be added to the [payload] node.
 * 4. [stop] - The string " END" that will be appended to the [payload] node's value.
