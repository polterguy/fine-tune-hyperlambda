/*
 * 1. `-`: This iterator retrieves the younger sibling of the current node. In Hyperlambda, a younger sibling is the node immediately preceding the current node in the hierarchy. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate a node that is directly above the current node in the Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. After using the `-` iterator to get the younger sibling, the `*` iterator will fetch all the children of that sibling node. This can be useful for operations where you need to process or evaluate all child nodes of a specific sibling node.
