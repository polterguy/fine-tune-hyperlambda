/*
 * 1. `@signal` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "signal" in the current context. It is used to locate a specific node within the hierarchy of nodes being processed.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "signal" node. It is used to access the immediate descendants of the "signal" node, regardless of their names.
 * 
 * 3. `public_key` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "public_key" among the children of the "signal" node. It is used to pinpoint the exact node of interest that contains the public key information.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression could be used in a cryptographic context where you need to retrieve a public key associated with a specific signal or identifier.
 * - It might be used in a communication protocol to verify the identity of a sender by accessing their public key stored under a "signal" node.
