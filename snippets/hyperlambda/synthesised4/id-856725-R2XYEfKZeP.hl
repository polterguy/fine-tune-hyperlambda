// This Hyperlambda code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate and extract the value from a specific node path. It navigates through a node hierarchy to find the [.feedback-channel] node under [.onerror] within [magic.ai.crawl-site], and unwraps its value. The [unwrap] slot ensures that all expressions are evaluated, allowing the retrieval of the final value.
