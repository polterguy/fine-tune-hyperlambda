// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.create] slot to insert a new record into the "vss_ml_training_snippets" table. It specifies two values to be inserted: [embedding_vss], which is derived from the [floatArray2bytes] expression, and [rowid], which is obtained from the [.arguments] node with the name "id". This approach ensures that the data is inserted into the database securely, preventing SQL injection attacks.
data.create
   table:vss_ml_training_snippets
   values
      embedding_vss:x:@floatArray2bytes
      rowid:x:@.arguments/*/id
