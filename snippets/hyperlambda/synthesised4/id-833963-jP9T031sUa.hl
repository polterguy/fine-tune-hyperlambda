// The [unwrap] slot evaluates expressions before the node it references is reached, allowing for forward evaluation of expressions. In the example, [unwrap:x:+] evaluates the expression, ensuring that the value of the [.dest] node is set to "Hello World" before [.dest] is processed. This is useful for pre-evaluating expressions in lambda objects before execution.
