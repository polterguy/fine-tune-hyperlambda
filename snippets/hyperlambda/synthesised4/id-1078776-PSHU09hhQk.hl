/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is used to navigate one level up in the node hierarchy.
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current node. It is used to access every child node under the current parent node.
 * 3. `whitelist` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "whitelist". It is used to specifically target nodes named "whitelist" among the children.
 * 4. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "whitelist" node. It is used to access every child node under the "whitelist" node.
 * 5. `.lambda` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name ".lambda". It is used to specifically target nodes named ".lambda" among the children of the "whitelist" node.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * - Accessing a specific lambda function within a whitelist configuration, possibly to evaluate or modify it.
 * - Retrieving all lambda functions that are part of a whitelist for further processing or validation.
