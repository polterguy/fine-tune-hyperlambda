// The code uses the [yield] slot to return the nodes referenced by the expression [@.hl-files/*], which implies it returns all child nodes of the [.hl-files] node. This is useful for dynamically returning a collection of nodes, such as when creating a dynamic slot or executing a file that needs to return multiple values or nodes.
