/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the `.arguments` node, which is crucial in HTTP endpoints to define the expected arguments for the endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any argument nodes defined within the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `id` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `id`. It is used to specifically target the `id` argument node within the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression is commonly used in Hyperlambda HTTP endpoints to access the value of an `id` argument passed to the endpoint. It ensures that the endpoint can retrieve and utilize the `id` value for further processing or validation.
