/*
 * 1. `@.result`: This iterator searches for the first node named "result" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It will not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. This is useful for retrieving a specific node that is expected to be an ancestor of the current node, such as when you want to access a result node that stores the outcome of a computation or operation.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used in a scenario where you need to retrieve the result of a previously executed operation that is stored in a node named "result" located somewhere above the current node in the hierarchy. For example, after performing a series of calculations, you might want to access the final result to use it in subsequent operations or to return it as part of a response.
