// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [validators.enum] slot to ensure that the value of the [aggregate_function] node within the [.arguments] node is one of the specified legal values: "min", "max", "sum", "avg", or "count". If the value does not match any of these, an exception will be thrown. This ensures that only valid aggregate functions are used in the context where this validation is applied.
