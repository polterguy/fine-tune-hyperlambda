/*
 * 1. `@.prompt`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "prompt" that is located before the current node in its hierarchy. It searches through the siblings and ancestors of the current node to find the first occurrence of a node named "prompt". 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access a specific configuration or data node named "prompt" that might be defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure. 
 * - It can be useful in scenarios where you need to reference a common node that holds a value or configuration used by multiple parts of the Hyperlambda script.
