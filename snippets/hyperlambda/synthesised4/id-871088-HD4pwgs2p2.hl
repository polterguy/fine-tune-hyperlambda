// This Hyperlambda code uses the [openai.tokenize] slot to calculate the number of tokens required for the text specified by the [.json] node. The slot is useful for determining token usage when interacting with OpenAI endpoints. The expression [x:@.json] points to the [.json] node, whose value is the text to be tokenized.
