// The code uses the [unwrap] slot to evaluate a complex expression before reaching the node where it is referenced. The expression navigates through the node hierarchy, moving to the next sibling, then to its children, and further down to the grandchildren, effectively "unwrapping" or evaluating the node structure at these levels. This allows for the forward evaluation of expressions within the lambda object, ensuring that the specified nodes are processed before the main execution flow reaches them.
