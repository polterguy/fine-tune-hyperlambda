/*
 * The code snippet changes the names of nodes under the [group] node within a [data.read] operation, specifically targeting nodes named [group_column]. It sets the new name of these nodes to the value obtained from the [group_column] argument provided in [.arguments]. This is useful for dynamically renaming group columns based on input arguments. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-name] - Changes the name of nodes specified by its expression.
 * 2. [@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column] - Expression targeting nodes named [group_column] under [group] in a [data.read] operation.
 * 3. [get-value:x:@.arguments/*/group_column] - Retrieves the value of the [group_column] argument from [.arguments] to use as the new name.
