/*
 * 1. `@.vectorize`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "vectorize" from the current node's hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it starts from the current node. This is useful when you need to access or manipulate data related to a specific node named "vectorize" within the current context.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing configuration or settings stored in a node named "vectorize" to apply vectorization techniques on data.
 * - Retrieving parameters or metadata associated with a vectorization process in a data processing pipeline.
