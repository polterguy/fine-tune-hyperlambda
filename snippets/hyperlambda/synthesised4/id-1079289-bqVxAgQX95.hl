/*
 * 1. `@.sql`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "sql" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates a search for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that the search should be conducted within the current context or scope. This is useful for accessing SQL-related data or configurations that are defined earlier in the Hyperlambda structure. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing a SQL query or command that has been defined earlier in the Hyperlambda script for execution or manipulation.
 * - Retrieving SQL connection strings or parameters that are needed for database operations.
