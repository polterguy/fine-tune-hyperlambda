/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator looks for the first node with the name "arguments" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node itself, until it finds a node named "arguments". This is useful for accessing a specific section of a Hyperlambda graph, typically used to retrieve the arguments passed to a function or slot.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "arguments" node found by the previous iterator. It allows you to access all the nodes that are directly under the "arguments" node, which could represent individual arguments or parameters.
 * 
 * 3. `[0,2]` - This iterator selects a subset of the nodes retrieved by the previous iterator. Specifically, it selects the first two nodes (starting from index 0) from the list of children nodes of the "arguments" node. This is useful when you need to work with or manipulate only a specific number of nodes from a larger set, such as when you need to process only the first two arguments in a list.
