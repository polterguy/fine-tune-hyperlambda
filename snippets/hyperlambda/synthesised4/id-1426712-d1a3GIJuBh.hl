// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [type] slot in Hyperlambda to determine the type of a node's value. It sets the value of a node named [.foo] to an integer (57) and then uses the [type] slot to retrieve the type of the value of the previous node, which in this case is "int". The [type] slot is used to identify and return the data type of a given value in Hyperlambda.
type:int
