/*
 * 1. `@for-each` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "for-each" in the current context. It is used to locate a loop construct that iterates over a set of nodes.
 * 2. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node named ".dp" that is a child of the "for-each" node. The ".dp" node typically represents the current node being processed in the loop, passed by reference.
 * 3. `#` - This iterator dereferences the value of the ".dp" node, assuming that the value is a node itself. It allows direct manipulation of the node being iterated over, rather than a copy of it.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used within a [for-each] loop to access and modify the nodes being iterated over directly. For example, it could be used to change the value of each node in a collection or to apply a transformation to each node's value.
