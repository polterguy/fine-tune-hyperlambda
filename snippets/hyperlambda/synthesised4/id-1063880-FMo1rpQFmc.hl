/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named `.arguments` within the current context. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot, especially in the context of HTTP endpoints where `.arguments` is a crucial node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all the children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access any node that is a direct child of `.arguments`, without filtering by name or value.
 * 
 * 3. `/headers` - This part of the expression filters the result set to include only those nodes named `headers`. It is used to specifically target the `headers` node within the children of `.arguments`, which would typically contain HTTP headers in an endpoint context.
 * 
 * 4. `/*` - This final iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `headers` node. It is used to access individual header nodes, each representing a specific HTTP header key-value pair.
