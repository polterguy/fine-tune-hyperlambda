// This Hyperlambda code iterates over each node in the result set of the expression [@data.select/*], concatenating the values of [prompt] and [completion] nodes from each iterated node into a temporary node [.tmp]. The [for-each] slot is used to loop through nodes, while [set-value] updates [.tmp] by appending text using [strings.concat]. The concatenation includes newline characters for formatting.
