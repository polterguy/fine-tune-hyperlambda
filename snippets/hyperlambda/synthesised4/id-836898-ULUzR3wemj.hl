// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the name of nodes at a specific path to a concatenated string. The [set-name] slot targets nodes located at the path "./*/data.read/*/columns/*/aggregate_functor" and renames them using [strings.concat]. The new name is formed by concatenating the value of [aggregate_function], an opening parenthesis, the value of [aggregate_column], and a closing parenthesis. This is useful for dynamically constructing names based on function and column arguments.
set-name:x:./*/data.read/*/columns/*/aggregate_functor

      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/aggregate_function
      .:(
      get-value:x:@.arguments/*/aggregate_column
