// This Hyperlambda code snippet replaces all occurrences of the backtick character in the value of the [.greeting] node with a string literal consisting of a backtick character. It uses the [strings.replace] slot to perform the replacement and [set-value] to update the [.greeting] node with the modified string. The code demonstrates string manipulation by replacing specific characters within a node's value.
