// The code retrieves the value of the node specified by the expression. It uses the [get-value] slot to access the value of a node, which is identified by navigating through the node hierarchy using the expression [x:@.dp/#/*/dflt_value]. This expression starts from the current node, moves to its value, then to its children, and finally selects the node named "dflt_value".
