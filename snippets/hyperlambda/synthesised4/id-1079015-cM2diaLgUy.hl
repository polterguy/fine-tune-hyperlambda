/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. The `@` symbol is used to find the first occurrence of a node with the specified name in the current hierarchy. This is useful for accessing the arguments passed to a function or an endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument that has been passed as a child node of `.arguments`.
 * 
 * 3. `secret` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `secret` from the previously retrieved children nodes. This is useful for accessing a specific argument named `secret` that might contain sensitive information or a key that needs to be processed or validated.
 * 
 * **Use Cases:**
 * - Retrieving a secret key or token passed as an argument to a function or endpoint for authentication or encryption purposes.
 * - Accessing configuration settings or sensitive data that are passed as arguments to ensure they are handled securely.
