/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet converts the value of the [max] node within the [.arguments] node to an integer type and sets it back to the [max] node. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Changes the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [convert] - Converts the value of the node specified by its expression to the specified type.
 * 3. [type] - Specifies the target type for conversion, which is "int" in this case.
