/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator looks for the first node named [.arguments] within the current context. It is often used to access the arguments passed to a function or slot in Hyperlambda, as [.arguments] is a common convention for holding input parameters.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This retrieves all children nodes of the [.arguments] node. It is used to access each argument passed to the function or slot.
 * 
 * 3. `invocation` - This filters the result set to only include nodes with the name [invocation]. It is used to specifically target arguments or nodes that are named [invocation].
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a Hyperlambda function to retrieve a specific argument named [invocation] from the list of arguments passed to the function. This might be useful in scenarios where the function needs to perform operations based on a specific invocation parameter.
