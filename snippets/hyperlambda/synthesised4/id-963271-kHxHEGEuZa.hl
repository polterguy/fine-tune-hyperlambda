// This Hyperlambda code iterates over the first two child nodes of the [.items] node using [for-each], and sets their values to "selected" using [set-value]. The [for-each] loop targets a subset of nodes specified by the expression [0,2], and the [set-value] modifies the value of each iterated node by referencing it through [.dp].
