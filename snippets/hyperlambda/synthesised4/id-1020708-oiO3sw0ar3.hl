/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all the children of the previously selected node, which in this case is the "arguments" node. It is used to access all the argument nodes that are children of the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `id` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "id" from the previously selected nodes. It is used to specifically access the "id" argument node among potentially many argument nodes.
