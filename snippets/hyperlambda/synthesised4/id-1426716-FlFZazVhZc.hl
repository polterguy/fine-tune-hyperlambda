// The [unwrap] slot in this code is used to evaluate expressions before the node where it's referenced is reached. It takes an expression as its value, which in this case is "+/*/*", and evaluates it, effectively "unwrapping" the expression. The result of the evaluation is then assigned to the node where [unwrap] is used. This allows for forward evaluation of expressions inside a lambda object before the lambda object is actually executed.
