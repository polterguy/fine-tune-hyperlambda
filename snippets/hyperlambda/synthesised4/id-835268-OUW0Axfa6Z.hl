// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to add two nodes from a signal's children. It retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node using [get-nodes] and adds them to the first two children of the [signal] node. The [add] slot takes an expression pointing to the nodes to be added, and the [get-nodes] slot retrieves nodes based on the specified expression.
add:x:./*/signal/[0,1]
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*
