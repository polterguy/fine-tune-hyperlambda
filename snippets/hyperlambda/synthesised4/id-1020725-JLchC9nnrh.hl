// 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node before in its hierarchy that matches the given name. In this case, it looks for the first node named "result" that is an ancestor or sibling of the current context. This is useful for accessing nodes that are not direct children but are still relevant to the current operation, allowing you to reference nodes that are part of the same logical block or structure.
