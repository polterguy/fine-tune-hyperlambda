// The code snippet uses the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot. The [get-nodes] slot targets nodes resulting from the [io.file.load] operation, and the [add] slot appends these nodes to the node referenced by [.dp], which is typically used in loops or dynamic slot executions to refer to the current node being processed.
