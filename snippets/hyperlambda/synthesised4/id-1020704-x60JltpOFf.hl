/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named ".arguments" from the current node's context. It is typically used to access the arguments node in a Hyperlambda execution context, which contains the input parameters or arguments passed to a slot or endpoint.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected node set. In this context, it retrieves all children of the ".arguments" node, which are typically individual argument nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `/name` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved node set to only include nodes named "name". It is used here to specifically access the "name" argument from the list of arguments, assuming such an argument exists within the ".arguments" node's children.
