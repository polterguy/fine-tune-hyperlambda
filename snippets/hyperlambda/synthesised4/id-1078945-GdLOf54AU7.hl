/*
 * 1. `@.session`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "session" from the current node's hierarchy. The `@` symbol indicates that it looks for a node by name, and the `.` implies it starts from the current node. 
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access session-related data or variables that are stored under a node named "session" in the current execution context.
 * - It might be used in scenarios where you need to check or manipulate session information, such as user authentication data or session-specific settings.
