/*
 * This Hyperlambda code demonstrates the use of the [switch] slot to perform conditional branching based on the value of a node. The [switch] slot evaluates the value of the [.val] node and executes the first matching [case] node. If no [case] matches, the [default] node is executed. This mechanism allows for executing different code paths based on the evaluated value, similar to a switch-case statement in traditional programming languages.
 * 
 * 1. [.val] - Declares an integer value to be evaluated by the [switch] statement.
 * 2. [.result] - Declares a node to store the result of the executed case.
 * 3. [switch] - Evaluates the value of [.val] to determine which [case] to execute.
 * 4. [case] - Contains a value to match against the evaluated value of [switch]. If matched, its children nodes are executed.
 * 5. [set-value] - Sets the value of [.result] based on the executed [case].
 * 6. [default] - Executed if none of the [case] nodes match the evaluated value of [switch].
