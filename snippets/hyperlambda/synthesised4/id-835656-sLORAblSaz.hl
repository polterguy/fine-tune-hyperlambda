// This Hyperlambda code changes the name of nodes within a specific path in a data connection structure. It targets nodes under [group] within [data.read] and sets their names to the value of a [group_column] argument. The code uses [set-name] to rename nodes and [get-value] to retrieve the new name from the specified argument.
set-name:x:@data.connect/*/data.read/*/group/*/group_column
