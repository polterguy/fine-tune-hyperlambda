/*
 * 1. `@.done`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "done" starting from the current node and moving upwards through its ancestors. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors up in the hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to check if a task or process has been marked as completed by looking for a "done" node in the hierarchy, which might be used in a workflow or task management system to determine if a certain step has been finished.
