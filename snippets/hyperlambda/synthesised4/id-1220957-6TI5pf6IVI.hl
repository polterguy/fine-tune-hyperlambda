// Retrieves the great-grandchildren of the elder sibling of the current node. This can be useful for accessing deeply nested data structures where you need to extract or manipulate data that is several levels down from a sibling node. For example, if you have a configuration or settings node structure, this expression could help in retrieving specific configuration values that are nested within a sibling's hierarchy.
