/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "arguments" from the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary, but does not traverse siblings.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected "arguments" node. It allows access to each child node within the "arguments" node.
 * 
 * 3. `columnType` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes with the name "columnType" from the previously retrieved children nodes. It ensures that only nodes specifically named "columnType" are selected from the children of the "arguments" node.
