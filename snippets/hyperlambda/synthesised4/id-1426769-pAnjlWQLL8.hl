/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [switch] slot, which functions similarly to a switch/case block in traditional programming languages. It evaluates the value of the [switch] node and executes the first [case] node with a matching value. If no [case] matches, the [default] node is executed. In this example, the value of [.val] is "foo", so the second [case] is executed, setting [.result] to "Success!". If [.val] had been "fooXX", the [default] node would have been executed, setting [.result] to "Success!". The [switch] node must have at least one [case] node, and the [default] node is optional. 
 * 
 * 1. [.val] - Holds the value to be evaluated by the [switch] node.
 * 2. [.result] - Stores the result of the executed [case] or [default] node.
 * 3. [switch] - Evaluates its expression and executes the matching [case] node.
 * 4. [case] - Contains a value to match against the [switch] node's evaluated value.
 * 5. [default] - Executed if no [case] node matches the [switch] node's evaluated value.
