 * // This Hyperlambda code snippet compares the lengths of two strings and sets a result based on the comparison. 
 * // If the length of the string at [.lhs/#] is less than the length of the string at [.rhs/#], it sets the value of [.result] to -1.
 * // 1. [if] - Initiates a conditional check.
 * // 2. [lt] - Compares the lengths of two strings to determine if the first is less than the second.
 * // 3. [strings.length:x:@.lhs/#] - Retrieves the length of the string at [.lhs/#].
 * // 4. [strings.length:x:@.rhs/#] - Retrieves the length of the string at [.rhs/#].
 * // 5. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the condition is true.
 * // 6. [set-value:x:@.result] - Sets the value of [.result].
 * // 7. [.:int:-1] - The value to set [.result] to, which is -1.
