/*
 * 1. `@try` - This iterator searches for the first node named "try" in the current context. It is useful for locating a specific node by name, especially when dealing with structured data where certain nodes have unique names.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node found by the previous iterator. In this context, it will fetch all children of the "try" node. This is useful for accessing all elements within a specific section of a node structure.
 * 
 * 3. `return` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes named "return" from the children of the "try" node. It is used to pinpoint specific nodes of interest within a broader set of nodes.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to find and process all "return" nodes within a "try" block in a Hyperlambda script, which might be useful for analyzing or modifying the behavior of error handling or return logic within the script.
