/*
 * // The provided Hyperlambda code demonstrates how to create and execute a dynamic slot using [slots.create] and [return-nodes]. The slot named "foo" is created, which returns a set of nodes containing an integer and a string when executed. The [return-nodes] slot is used to return multiple nodes from within the dynamically created slot. This allows for the encapsulation of logic within a slot that can be reused and executed as needed. The [signal] slot is then used to invoke the "foo" slot, which returns the nodes defined within it.
 * // 1. [slots.create] - Creates a new dynamic slot named "foo".
 * // 2. [return-nodes] - Returns a set of nodes from the dynamic slot.
 * // 3. [integer-value] - A node with an integer value returned by the slot.
 * // 4. [string-value] - A node with a string value returned by the slot.
 * // 5. [signal] - Invokes the dynamic slot "foo".
