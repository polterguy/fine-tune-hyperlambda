// The code snippet modifies the value of a node within a Hyperlambda tree structure. It specifically targets the [as] node within the second child of the [columns] node under [data.read], which is a child of [data.connect]. The new value for this node is retrieved from the [aggregate_function] node within the [.arguments] node, effectively allowing dynamic assignment based on provided arguments.
set-value:x:@data.connect/*/data.read/*/columns/1/*/as
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/aggregate_function
