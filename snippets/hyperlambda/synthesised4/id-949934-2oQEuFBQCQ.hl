// The code demonstrates the use of the [eval] slot to execute a lambda object directly within its children nodes. The [eval] slot executes the [set-value] slot, which sets the value of the [.res] node to "Inline". This showcases how [eval] can execute inline lambda objects, modifying nodes outside of its own scope.
