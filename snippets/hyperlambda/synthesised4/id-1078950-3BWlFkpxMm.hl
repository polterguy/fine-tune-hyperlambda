/*
 * 1. `@.scan`: This iterator starts by finding the first node named "scan" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it is looking for a node by name, and the "." prefix means it starts the search from the current node level.
 * 
 * 2. `0`: This iterator selects the first child of the node set returned by the previous iterator. In this context, it retrieves the first child node of the "scan" node.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node set returned by the previous iterator. Here, it gathers all children of the first child node of the "scan" node.
 * 
 * 4. `cached`: This iterator filters the node set to only include nodes named "cached" from the previous result set. It effectively narrows down the selection to nodes named "cached" among the children of the first child of the "scan" node.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * 
 * - This expression could be used to retrieve cached data or configuration settings from a specific part of a data structure, particularly when dealing with hierarchical data where caching is implemented at a specific node level.
 * - It could be useful in scenarios where you need to verify or manipulate cached information within a larger dataset, ensuring that operations are performed only on the relevant cached nodes.
