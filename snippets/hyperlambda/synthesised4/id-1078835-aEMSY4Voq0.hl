/*
 * 1. `@.buffer`: This iterator searches for the first node named "buffer" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including the current node's siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you need to locate a specific node by name within the current scope.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously matched node(s). In this case, it retrieves all children of the "buffer" node. This is useful for accessing the entire set of child nodes to perform further operations or filtering.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: This second `*` iterator retrieves all children nodes of each node found by the previous iterator. This means it goes one level deeper into the hierarchy, accessing grandchildren of the "buffer" node. This is useful for navigating through nested structures.
 * 
 * 4. `*`: The third `*` iterator continues to retrieve all children nodes of each node found by the previous iterator, going another level deeper. This allows access to great-grandchildren of the "buffer" node. This is useful for deeply nested structures where you need to access nodes multiple levels down.
 * 
 * 5. `parameters`: This final iterator filters the nodes retrieved by the previous iterators to only include those with the name "parameters". It effectively narrows down the node set to those specifically named "parameters" at the deepest level accessed. This is useful for extracting specific data points or configurations within a complex hierarchical structure.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Extracting configuration parameters from a deeply nested data structure where the "parameters" node contains key-value pairs or settings.
 * - Accessing specific data points within a hierarchical data buffer for processing or analysis.
