/*
 * 1. `@` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the specified name, which in this case is "id". It searches for the node named "id" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings and ancestors. This is useful when you need to find a specific node by name within the current context or its ancestors.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to retrieve the value of an "id" node that might be defined at a higher level in the hierarchy, such as a unique identifier for a data structure or an object within a larger context.
