/*
 * The code checks if two specific files, "/config/settings.json" and "/logs/system.log", exist. If both files are present, it sets the value of the [.result] node to a string indicating that both files are available for processing. The [if] slot uses the [and] slot to ensure both conditions must be true for the [.lambda] block to execute. 
 * 
 * 1. [if] - Begins a conditional statement that executes its [.lambda] child if its condition is true.
 * 2. [and] - Combines multiple conditions, requiring all to be true for the [.lambda] to execute.
 * 3. [io.file.exists] - Checks if the specified file exists.
 * 4. [.lambda] - Contains the code to execute if the [if] condition is true.
 * 5. [set-value] - Sets the value of a node.
 * 6. [.] - Represents a static string value to assign to [.result].
