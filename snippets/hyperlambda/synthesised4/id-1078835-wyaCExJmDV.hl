/*
 * 1. `@.arg`: This iterator searches for the first node named "arg" in the current context. It starts from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful for accessing specific nodes by name when you know the node exists somewhere in the hierarchy above the current node.
 * 
 * 2. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the result set from the previous iterator. In this context, it will return all children of the "arg" node. This is useful when you want to process or evaluate all children nodes of a specific parent node.
 * 
 * **Use Case**: This expression could be used in a scenario where you have a node named "arg" that contains multiple child nodes, and you need to access all of these children for further processing or evaluation, such as iterating over them in a loop or applying a transformation to each child node.
