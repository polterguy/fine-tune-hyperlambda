/*
 * 1. `@.no`: This iterator looks for the first node with the name "no" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` before `no` suggests it should start the search from the current node's context. This expression is useful when you want to retrieve or manipulate a specific node named "no" within the current hierarchy. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Checking the existence of a node named "no" to conditionally execute further logic.
 * - Retrieving the value of the "no" node for validation or processing purposes.
