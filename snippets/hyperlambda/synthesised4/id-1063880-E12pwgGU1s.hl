// 1. `-`: This iterator retrieves the previous result set's younger sibling, which is the node directly above it in the Hyperlambda structure. This is useful when you want to access or manipulate the node that is immediately preceding the current node in the hierarchy. For example, if you have a sequence of nodes and you want to perform an operation on the node that comes right before the current one, this iterator will help you achieve that.
