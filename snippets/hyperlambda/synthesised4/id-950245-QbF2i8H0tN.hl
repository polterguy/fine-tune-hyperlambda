// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [yield] slot to return a value from a dynamic slot or a Hyperlambda file execution. It retrieves the value of the [counter] node and returns it as [word-count]. The [yield] slot is crucial for outputting results in Hyperlambda, allowing the encapsulated logic to provide a final result to the caller.
