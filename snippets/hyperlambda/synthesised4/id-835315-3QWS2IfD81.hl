// This Hyperlambda code logs an error message indicating a problem occurred while importing products from WooCommerce. It uses the [log.error] slot to create a log entry with a static message. The log entry includes additional details from the [.arguments] node, specifically the error message, type, and shop URL, which are extracted using lambda expressions. The [log.error] slot is used to record the error details for further analysis or debugging.
