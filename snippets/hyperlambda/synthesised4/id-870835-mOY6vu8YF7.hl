// This code snippet demonstrates how to use the [add] slot to append nodes to a specified location. The [add] slot takes as its source the nodes returned by the [get-nodes] slots, which reference specific nodes within the [.arguments] node. The nodes being added are those pointed to by the expressions [@.arguments/*/subject], [@.arguments/*/email], and [@.arguments/*/domain]. The result is that these nodes are appended to the location specified by the [add] slot's expression.
add:x:../*/signal
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/subject
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/email
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*/domain
