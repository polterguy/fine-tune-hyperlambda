/*
 * 1. `@.lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "lambda" from the current context. It is useful when you need to access a specific node by name within the current hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously selected "lambda" node. It is used to access all direct descendants of a node, allowing you to perform operations on or gather information from all child nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `lambda2hyper` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved children nodes to only include those with the name "lambda2hyper". It is useful when you need to focus on specific nodes among the children, particularly when performing operations or evaluations on nodes with a specific name.
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression can be used to locate and process nodes named "lambda2hyper" that are children of a node named "lambda". This could be useful in scenarios where you are transforming or evaluating specific parts of a Hyperlambda graph related to "lambda2hyper" operations or transformations.
