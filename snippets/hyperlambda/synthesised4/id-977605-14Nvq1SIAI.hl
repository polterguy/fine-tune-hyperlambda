// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a conditional check using [if], [and], and [or] slots. It evaluates whether [.foo1] is equal to "bar" and either [.foo2] or [.foo3] is true. If both conditions are met, it sets the value of [.result] to "Yup!". The [and] slot ensures both its conditions are true, while the [or] slot requires at least one of its conditions to be true.
