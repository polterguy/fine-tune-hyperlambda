/*
 * 1. `@.words` - This iterator starts by locating the first node with the name "words" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it searches for a node with the specified name. This is useful when you want to begin your expression from a specific node within the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "words" node. The `*` symbol is used to access all immediate child nodes, allowing you to perform operations or evaluations on each of them. This is particularly useful when you need to process or analyze all elements contained within a parent node.
