/*
 * 1. `@.has-sent-waiting` - This iterator searches for the first node with the name "has-sent-waiting" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors up in the hierarchy. This is useful when you need to check or retrieve a specific node's value or presence that is defined earlier in the same context or scope, ensuring that the node is an ancestor of the current node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used to verify if a certain condition or flag, such as "has-sent-waiting", has been set earlier in the execution flow, which might be crucial for decision-making processes or conditional logic within a Hyperlambda script.
