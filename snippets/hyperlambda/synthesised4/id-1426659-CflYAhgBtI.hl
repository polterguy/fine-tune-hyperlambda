 * // This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value of a specific node in a node graph using a complex lambda expression. 
 * // The expression navigates through the node structure to find the desired node, and then extracts its value.
 * // 1. [get-value] - Retrieves the value of the node its expression is pointing to.
 * // 2. [x] - Specifies the expression to evaluate for [get-value].
 * // 3. ["@.dp/#/./*/\\@href/[0,1]"] - The lambda expression that navigates through the node structure to find the node whose value is to be retrieved.
