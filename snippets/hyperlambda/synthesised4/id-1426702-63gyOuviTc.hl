/*
 * This Hyperlambda code snippet adds a new node to an existing node set. Specifically, it adds a node under the [snippets] node, which itself contains two child nodes: [prompt] and [completion]. The [prompt] node's value is set to the value of the [prompt] node in the current context, and the [completion] node's value is set to the value of the [completion] node in the current context. This structure is useful for organizing and storing pairs of prompts and their corresponding completions, possibly for use in a system that generates or processes such pairs.
 * 
 * 1. [add] - Adds a new node to the specified node set.
 * 2. [.] - Represents a new node being added.
 * 3. [prompt] - Sets the value of this node to the value of the [prompt] node in the current context.
 * 4. [completion] - Sets the value of this node to the value of the [completion] node in the current context.
