// This Hyperlambda code snippet changes the value of the [filename] node found within the [execute] node, which is a child of [invocation], to the value of the [filename] node found within the [arguments] node. It achieves this by using [set-value] to update the target node's value with the result obtained from [get-value], ensuring that the filename used in the execution process is dynamically set based on the provided argument.
set-value:x:@.invocation/*/execute/*/filename
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/filename
