// This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL query on a SQLite database, joining the "Treatments" table with the "Patients" table using a left join on the "PatientID" column. It selects an aggregated column, aliasing it as "result", and applies a "where" condition with an "and" clause. The query limits the result to a single record. The [database-type] specifies the database, [table] and [join] define the tables and join type, [columns] specifies the columns to select, and [limit] restricts the number of results.
