// This Hyperlambda code retrieves the value from the [result] node within the [execute] node, extracts a substring starting from index 0, and sets this substring as the new value of the [result] node. The length of the substring is determined by converting the result of a [math.multiply] operation into an integer. The [math.multiply] operation's result is used to specify the length of the substring.
