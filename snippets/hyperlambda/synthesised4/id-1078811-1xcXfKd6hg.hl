// 1. `@.db-type`: This iterator searches for the first node named "db-type" in the current context. It starts from the current node and looks upwards in the hierarchy, including siblings, until it finds the first occurrence of a node with the specified name. This is useful when you need to retrieve configuration or metadata information related to the database type in a structured data set. For example, it could be used to determine which database driver or connection string to use based on the type of database specified in the configuration.
