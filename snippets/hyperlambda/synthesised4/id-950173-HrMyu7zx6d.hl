// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [math.subtract] slot to calculate the difference between two values. It retrieves the values of [income] and [tax] from the [.arguments] node using [get-value] and subtracts the [tax] from the [income]. The result is the net income after tax.
math.subtract
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/income
   get-value:x:@.arguments/*/tax
