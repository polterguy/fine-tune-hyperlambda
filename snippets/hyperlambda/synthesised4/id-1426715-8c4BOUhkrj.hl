/*
 * /*
 *  * This Hyperlambda code retrieves the first non-null value from a set of potential sources.
 *  * It first attempts to get the value of a node specified by the expression [get-value], which points to a node named [webhook_incoming_url] within the [model] node.
 *  * If this value is null, it defaults to retrieving a configuration setting using [config.get], specifically the path "magic:openai:integrations:incoming:url".
 *  * This approach is useful for providing a fallback mechanism, ensuring a value is always returned even if the primary source is unavailable.
 *  *
 *  * 1. [get-first-value] - Retrieves the first non-null value from the following child nodes.
 *  * 2. [get-value] - Attempts to retrieve the value of the [webhook_incoming_url] node within the [model] node.
 *  * 3. [config.get] - Provides a fallback by retrieving a configuration value if the first attempt returns null.
