/*
 * 1. `@.allow` - This iterator searches for the first node named "allow" that is at the same level or higher in the hierarchy relative to the current node. It starts from the current node and moves upwards until it finds a node with the specified name. This is useful for accessing configuration or permission settings that might be defined at a higher level in the structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "allow" node. It allows you to access every child node under "allow", which can be useful for iterating over a list of permissions or settings that are defined as children of the "allow" node. 
 * 
 * Potential use case: This expression could be used in a system where you need to check or manipulate all permissions or settings defined under an "allow" node, which might be part of an access control list or configuration settings.
