// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates converting a lambda object to a CSV format and back again, preserving type information. It uses the [lambda2csv] slot to transform the lambda object into a CSV string, and the [csv2lambda] slot to revert the CSV back to a lambda object. The [add] slot is used to append type information, ensuring accurate type conversion during the roundtrip process.
