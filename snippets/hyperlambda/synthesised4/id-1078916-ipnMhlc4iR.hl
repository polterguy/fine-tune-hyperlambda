/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by locating the first node named [.arguments] within the current context. This is typically used to access the arguments passed into a function or an HTTP endpoint in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all the child nodes of the [.arguments] node. This is useful when you want to access all the arguments provided, regardless of their specific names.
 * 
 * 3. `code` - This iterator filters the previously retrieved nodes to find the first node with the name [code]. This is typically used to access a specific argument named "code" that might contain some code or a code identifier.
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression can be used in a scenario where you need to access a specific argument named "code" from a list of arguments passed to a function or endpoint. For example, it might be used in a code execution service where the "code" argument contains the code to be executed.
