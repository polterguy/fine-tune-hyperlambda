/*
 * This Hyperlambda code checks if a specific URL does not start with "http://" or "https://". It uses the [and] slot to combine two [not] conditions, each using [strings.starts-with] to verify that the URL does not begin with the specified protocols. The URL is retrieved using a lambda expression that navigates through the node structure to find the [@href] attribute. 
 * 
 * 1. [and] - Combines multiple conditions, ensuring all must be true.
 * 2. [not] - Negates the boolean value of its child condition.
 * 3. [strings.starts-with] - Checks if a string starts with a specified sequence of characters.
 * 4. [@.dp/#/./*/\\@href/[0,1]] - Lambda expression to navigate and retrieve the [@href] attribute.
