// The code snippet uses the [openai.tokenize] slot to calculate the number of tokens required by the OpenAI API for the JSON representation of a lambda object. It first converts the lambda object to JSON using [lambda2json] and then passes the resulting JSON to [openai.tokenize] to determine the token count.
openai.tokenize:x:@lambda2json
