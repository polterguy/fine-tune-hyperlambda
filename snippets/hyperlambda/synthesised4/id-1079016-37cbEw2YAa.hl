/*
 * 1. `.` - This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current node. It is useful when you need to access or manipulate the parent node of the current context within a Hyperlambda structure.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previous result set. It is commonly used to access all child nodes of a given node, allowing for operations on each child node.
 * 
 * 3. `remove-nodes` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "remove-nodes". It is useful when you want to specifically target nodes named "remove-nodes" for further processing or manipulation.
 * 
 * **Potential Use Cases:**
 * - This expression could be used to locate and manipulate nodes named "remove-nodes" within the children of the parent node of the current context. For example, it might be used to remove or modify these nodes as part of a cleanup or restructuring operation within a Hyperlambda graph.
