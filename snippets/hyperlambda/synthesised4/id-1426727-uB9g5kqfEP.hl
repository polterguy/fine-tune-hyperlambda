/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates how to retrieve the type of a node's value. The [type] slot is used to obtain the type name of the value of the preceding node. In this example, a node named [.foo] is declared with an integer value of 57, and the [type] slot is invoked to determine the type of this value. The result of the [type] slot will be the type name "int". 
 * 
 * 1. [.foo] - Declares a node with an integer value.
 * 2. [type] - Retrieves the type name of the preceding node's value.
