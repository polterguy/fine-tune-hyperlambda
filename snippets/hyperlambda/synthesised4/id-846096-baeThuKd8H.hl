// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [and] slot to evaluate multiple conditions, specifically checking if the type of a node in the [.arguments] collection is equal to a specified value using the [type.eq] slot. The [and] slot ensures that all conditions must be true for the entire expression to evaluate to true. The [type.eq] slot compares the type of a node against a given type, ensuring type safety in the evaluation.
