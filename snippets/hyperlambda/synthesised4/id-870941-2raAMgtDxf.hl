// The code defines a socket signal for a workflow action in Magic, specifying roles and arguments. It includes a [roles] node set to "root" and an [args] node with a [type] set to "result". The [time] node uses [math.subtract] to perform a subtraction operation, and an [output] node is included to handle the result of the operation.
