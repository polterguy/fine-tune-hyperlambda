/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` from the current context. It is used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot, which are typically organized under an `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each individual argument that is passed under the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `group_column` - This iterator filters the children nodes to return only those with the name `group_column`. It is used to specifically access the `group_column` argument, which might represent a column name or identifier used for grouping data in a data processing task.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a data processing or analysis task where you need to dynamically access a specific column name or identifier from the arguments to perform grouping operations on a dataset.
 * - It might be used in a reporting tool where the user specifies a column to group data by, and this expression retrieves that column name for further processing.
