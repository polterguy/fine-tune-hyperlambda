/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator finds the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol is used to search for a node by name, and it will return the first match it encounters in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all child nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access the children of the previously selected node.
 * 
 * 3. `user_id` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `user_id`. It selects nodes from the previous result set that match this name.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used in a scenario where you need to retrieve the `user_id` from a list of arguments passed to a function or an HTTP endpoint. It is useful for extracting specific user information from a structured data set.
