/*
 * 1. `@.failed`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "failed" in its hierarchy. It starts from the current node and looks upwards, including the current node itself, until it finds a node named "failed". If no such node exists, it returns null. 
 * 
 * Use Case: This expression can be used to check if there is a "failed" node in the current execution context, which might indicate an error or failure state in a process. It can be particularly useful in error handling or logging scenarios where you need to determine if a failure has occurred at any point in the current execution path.
