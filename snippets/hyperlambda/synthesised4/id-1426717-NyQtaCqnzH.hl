/*
 * This Hyperlambda code takes a string, splits it into multiple parts, and then joins those parts back together with a comma as the separator. The final result is set as the value of the node referenced by the expression in [set-value]. 
 * 
 * 1. [set-value] - Sets the value of the node referenced by its expression.
 * 2. [strings.join] - Joins multiple strings with a specified separator.
 * 3. [strings.split] - Splits a string into multiple parts.
 * 4. [.] - Specifies the separator for joining, in this case, a comma.
