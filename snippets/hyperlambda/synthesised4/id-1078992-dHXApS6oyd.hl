/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator searches for the first node named "arguments" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It is typically used to access the arguments passed to a function or a slot, especially in the context of dynamic slots or HTTP endpoints where arguments are passed in a structured format.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the previously found "arguments" node. It is used to access any node that is a direct child of the "arguments" node, allowing for further filtering or operations on these child nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `/connection-string` - This part of the expression filters the children nodes retrieved by the `*` iterator, returning only those nodes that have the name "connection-string". It is used to specifically access the "connection-string" node within the arguments, which is often used to store database connection strings or similar configuration data.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Retrieving a database connection string passed as an argument to a Hyperlambda slot or HTTP endpoint for use in database operations.
 * - Accessing configuration settings that are passed as arguments to dynamically adjust the behavior of a slot or endpoint.
