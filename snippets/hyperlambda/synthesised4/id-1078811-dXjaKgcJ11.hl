/*
 * 1. `@if`: This iterator searches for the first node named "if" in the current context. It is often used to locate conditional branching logic in Hyperlambda, such as if-statements.
 * 
 * 2. `.`: This iterator retrieves the parent node of the current result set. It is useful for navigating upwards in the node hierarchy to access parent nodes.
 * 
 * 3. `*`: This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the current result set. It is commonly used to access all immediate child nodes for further processing or evaluation.
 * 
 * 4. `data.execute`: This iterator filters the current result set to only include nodes named "data.execute". It is typically used to locate specific nodes that are responsible for executing data-related operations or logic.
 * 
 * Potential use cases for this expression include:
 * - Locating and executing a specific "data.execute" node within the context of an "if" conditional block, allowing for conditional execution of data operations.
 * - Navigating through a node hierarchy to access and process data execution nodes based on certain conditions defined by an "if" statement.
