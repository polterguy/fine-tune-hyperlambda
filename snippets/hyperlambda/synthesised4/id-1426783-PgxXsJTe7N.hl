// The code demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. It specifies a fallback operation that is executed if none of the preceding conditions in an if-else chain are met. In this case, the [else] slot contains an [eval] slot that executes a lambda object referenced by the expression [@.invoke]. This allows for dynamic execution of code when all other conditional checks fail.
