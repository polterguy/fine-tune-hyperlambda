// 1. `@.no`: This iterator searches for the first node with the name "no" starting from the current node and moving upwards in the hierarchy. It does not traverse siblings, only direct ancestors. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to find a specific configuration or setting node that is defined at a higher level in the hierarchy, such as retrieving a global configuration setting or a parent node's attribute.
