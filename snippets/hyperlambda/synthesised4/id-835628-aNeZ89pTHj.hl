// The code adds nodes to the current node's children by using the [add] slot. It retrieves nodes from the [.arguments] node using [get-nodes], specifically targeting nodes named [order] and [direction]. The retrieved nodes are then added as children to the node specified by the [add] slot's expression. This operation effectively copies the specified nodes from the [.arguments] node to the destination node.
