 * // This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL read operation on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "Treatments" table.
 * // It includes a left join with the "Patients" table, using "PatientID" as an alias for the join condition.
 * // The [columns] node specifies a distinct function, and the [where] node is prepared for additional filtering conditions.
 * // 1. [database-type] - Specifies the type of database being used, which is SQLite.
 * // 2. [table] - Indicates the main table for the SQL operation, "Treatments".
 * // 3. [join] - Establishes a left join with the "Patients" table using "PatientID".
 * // 4. [as] - Sets an alias for the join condition.
 * // 5. [type] - Defines the type of join, which is a left join in this case.
 * // 6. [on] - Specifies the condition for the join, matching "PatientID" from both tables.
 * // 7. [columns] - Lists the columns to be selected, with a distinct function applied.
 * // 8. [where] - Placeholder for filtering conditions, currently empty.
