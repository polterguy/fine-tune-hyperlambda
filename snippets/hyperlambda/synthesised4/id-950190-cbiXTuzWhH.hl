// The code snippet demonstrates the use of the [else] slot in Hyperlambda. The [else] slot executes its child nodes if none of the preceding [if] or [else-if] conditions are met. In this example, the [else] slot sets the value of the [.result] node to "Nope!" using the [set-value] slot, indicating that none of the previous conditions were true.
else:bool:false
   set-value:x:@.result
      .:Nope!
