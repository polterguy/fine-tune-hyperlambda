// 1. `@.sql`: This iterator starts by looking for the first node with the name "sql" in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will search for a node by name, and the `.` specifies that it should start the search from the current node's context. This is useful when you need to find a specific node by its name within the current hierarchy, such as retrieving a SQL query or command node to execute or manipulate further.
