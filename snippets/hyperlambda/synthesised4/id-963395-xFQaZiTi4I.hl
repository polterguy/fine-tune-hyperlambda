// The code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.execute] slot to insert a new record into the "subscribers" table with an email value. The [data.execute] slot executes an SQL command, and the email parameter is dynamically inserted using the @email placeholder, which is resolved from the [.email] node. This approach helps prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries.
data.execute:insert into subscribers (email) values (@email)
   @email:x:@.email
