// This Hyperlambda code checks if a file specified in the [.arguments] node does not exist using [io.file.exists]. If the file is not found, it throws an exception with a "File not found" message, a status code of 404, and sets the exception to be public using [throw]. The [not] slot inverts the condition, ensuring the [throw] slot is executed only when the file is missing.
