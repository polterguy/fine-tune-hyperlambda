/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by finding the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it will look for a node with the specified name, starting from the current node and traversing upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node found in the previous step. It essentially expands the search to include all direct descendants of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * 3. `columnName` - This iterator filters the result set from the previous step to include only those nodes that have the name `columnName`. It effectively narrows down the search to nodes specifically named `columnName` among the children of the `.arguments` node.
 * 
 * This expression is useful in scenarios where you need to access a specific parameter or argument named `columnName` that is passed into a Hyperlambda function or endpoint. It allows you to dynamically reference and manipulate the value of this argument within your Hyperlambda code.
