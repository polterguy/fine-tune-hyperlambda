// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [and] slot to evaluate multiple conditions. It checks if the [enabled] node's value is equal to true using the [eq] slot, and the [and] slot ensures that all conditions must evaluate to true for the entire expression to be true. The code is useful for scenarios where multiple conditions need to be satisfied simultaneously.
