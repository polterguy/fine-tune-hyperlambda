/*
 * 1. `@.incoming`: This iterator searches for the first node named "incoming" that is located before or at the same level as the current node in the hierarchy. It does not traverse sibling nodes but looks for the node in the current context or its ancestors. This is useful for accessing data or configuration settings that have been passed into the current context, such as incoming HTTP request data or parameters in a larger Hyperlambda script. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - Accessing incoming HTTP request data in an endpoint handler.
 * - Retrieving configuration or state information passed into a dynamically executed slot.
