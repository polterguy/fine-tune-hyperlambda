// This Hyperlambda code snippet uses the [set-name] slot to rename all [data.read] nodes within the [hyper2lambda] node hierarchy to [mysql.read]. This operation is useful for transforming generic data access nodes to MySQL-specific nodes, allowing for database-specific operations. The expression [x:@hyper2lambda/**/data.read] identifies all [data.read] nodes under the [hyper2lambda] hierarchy, and the new name [mysql.read] is applied to these nodes.
set-name:x:@hyper2lambda/**/data.read
   .:mysql.read
