// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to use the [data.create] slot to insert a record into a database table named "ml_types". The [table] node specifies the target table, while the [values] node is intended to contain the fields and their corresponding values that will be inserted into the table. The [data.create] slot is used for creating new records in a specified table, ensuring that values are safely parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
