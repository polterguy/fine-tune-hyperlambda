// This Hyperlambda code performs a SQL query on a SQLite database, specifically targeting the "Treatments" table. It includes a left join with the "Patients" table based on the "PatientID" field. The query selects distinct records using a "distinct_functor" column, which is aliased as "count". The [where] clause is prepared for additional conditions but is currently empty. The [database-type] slot specifies the database type as SQLite, and the [join] slot facilitates the left join operation.
