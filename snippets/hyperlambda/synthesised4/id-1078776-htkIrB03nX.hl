/*
 * 1. `@hyper2lambda` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "hyper2lambda" from the current context. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards in the hierarchy if necessary.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the "hyper2lambda" node. It will include every direct child node under "hyper2lambda" in the result set.
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression could be used to gather all configuration or data nodes under a specific section named "hyper2lambda" in a larger Hyperlambda structure.
 * - It might be applied in scenarios where you need to process or evaluate all elements within a specific category or module identified by "hyper2lambda".
