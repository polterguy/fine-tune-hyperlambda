// This Hyperlambda code performs an HTTP GET request to the URL "https://meowfacts.herokuapp.com/" and includes a [convert] argument set to true. This setup ensures that the response from the server is automatically converted into a lambda object format if a conversion function is registered for the response's content type. The [convert] argument facilitates seamless integration of the response data into Hyperlambda's node structure.
