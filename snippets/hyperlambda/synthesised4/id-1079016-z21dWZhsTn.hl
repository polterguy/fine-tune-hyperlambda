/*
 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator retrieves the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. It is used to access the node that typically contains arguments for a function or operation in Hyperlambda.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node. It is used to access each argument node individually.
 * 
 * 3. `type` - This iterator filters the result set to only include nodes named `type` among the children of the `.arguments` node. It is used to specifically access the `type` node of each argument.
 * 
 * **Use Cases:**
 * - This expression can be used to extract the `type` information of each argument passed to a function or operation, which is useful for type validation or processing logic based on argument types.
