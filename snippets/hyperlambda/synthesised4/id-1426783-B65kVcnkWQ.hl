// This Hyperlambda code uses the [sockets.signal] slot to send a signal to all clients connected to the current session. It includes an [args] node that contains three arguments: [function_result], [invocation], and [file]. These arguments are dynamically populated using expressions that retrieve values from other nodes in the Hyperlambda graph. Specifically, [function_result] gets its value from [config.get], [invocation] from [execute] with a child node [json], and [file] from [execute] with a child node [workflow]. This setup allows for real-time communication with clients, transmitting specific data derived from the execution context.
