 * 1. `@.arguments` - This iterator starts by looking for the first node named `.arguments` in the current context. The `@` symbol indicates that it is searching for a node by name, and the search is limited to the current hierarchy level and its ancestors.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the `.arguments` node found in the previous step. It allows access to each child node under `.arguments`, which is useful for iterating over or manipulating these nodes.
