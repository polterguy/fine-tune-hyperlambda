// This Hyperlambda code uses the [set-value] slot to change the value of the node referenced by its expression [@.tmp] to the value retrieved from the node referenced by [@.fixed] using [get-value]. The [set-value] slot modifies the destination node's value, while [get-value] retrieves the source node's value.
