/*
 * 1. `..` - This iterator retrieves the root node of the currently executed Hyperlambda. It is used to navigate to the top of the node hierarchy from the current position. This is useful when you need to access or modify nodes at the root level, regardless of your current position in the node tree.
 * 
 * 2. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of its previous result set. In this context, it retrieves all children nodes of the root node. This is useful for iterating over or examining all nodes directly under the root node.
 * 
 * 3. `.invoke` - This iterator retrieves nodes with the name `.invoke` from the previous result set. Here, it filters the children of the root node to find those named `.invoke`. This is useful for locating specific nodes that are meant to invoke certain actions or slots.
 * 
 * 4. `*` - Again, this retrieves all children nodes of the `.invoke` nodes. It allows access to all nodes nested within each `.invoke` node, which might contain parameters or further instructions.
 * 
 * 5. `while` - This iterator retrieves nodes named `while` from the previous result set. It is used to find `while` loops within the children of `.invoke` nodes. This is useful for identifying and potentially manipulating loop constructs.
 * 
 * 6. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the `while` nodes. This allows access to the body of the `while` loops, which contains the logic and operations to be repeated.
 * 
 * 7. `.lambda` - This iterator retrieves nodes named `.lambda` from the previous result set. It is used to find lambda expressions or blocks of code within the `while` loop. This is useful for executing or modifying the logic encapsulated in lambda expressions.
 * 
 * 8. `*` - Retrieves all children nodes of the `.lambda` nodes. This allows access to the detailed operations or slots defined within the lambda expressions.
 * 
 * 9. `http.post` - This iterator retrieves nodes named `http.post` from the previous result set. It is used to find HTTP POST requests within the lambda expressions. This is useful for identifying outgoing HTTP requests that are part of the loop's logic, potentially for sending data to an external service or API.
 * 
 * Use cases for this expression include analyzing or modifying the logic of HTTP POST requests within `while` loops in a Hyperlambda script, such as for debugging, optimization, or ensuring compliance with certain standards.
