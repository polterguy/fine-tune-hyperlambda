// The code snippet uses the [add] slot to append nodes retrieved by the [get-nodes] slot from a specific path to the node set referenced by [@.file-data]. The [get-nodes] slot fetches nodes from the path [@signal/*], and these nodes are then added to the node set at [@.file-data]. This operation effectively merges the nodes from the source path into the target node set.
