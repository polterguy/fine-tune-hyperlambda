// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database, specifically from the "Customers" table. It selects distinct values using a "distinct_functor" and aliases it as "count". The [where] clause is prepared for additional conditions, but currently, it only contains an [and] node without any conditions specified.
