/*
 * 1. `@.new-prompt`: This iterator retrieves the first node with the name "new-prompt" that is located before the current node in the hierarchy. It starts the search from the current node and moves upwards and sideways in the hierarchy to find the first matching node. 
 * 
 * Potential use cases:
 * - This expression can be used to access configuration or settings stored in a node named "new-prompt" that is defined earlier in the Hyperlambda code.
 * - It can be useful for referencing a previously defined node that contains important data or parameters needed for further processing in the current context.
