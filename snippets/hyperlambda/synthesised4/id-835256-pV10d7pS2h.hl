// The provided Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates the use of the [return] slot to return a boolean value of true. The [return] slot is used to exit a lambda function and optionally provide a return value. In this case, the return value is a boolean true, which can be used to indicate successful execution or a positive condition. The [return] slot does not evaluate expressions, so the value is returned as-is.
return:bool:true
