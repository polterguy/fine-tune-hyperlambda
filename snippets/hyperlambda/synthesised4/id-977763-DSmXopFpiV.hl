// This Hyperlambda code connects to a CRM database and deletes a record from the "customers" table. It uses a [where] clause to specify the condition for deletion, ensuring that only the record with a matching [customer_id] from the input arguments is removed. The [data.connect] slot establishes the database connection, while [data.delete] performs the deletion operation.
