// The Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates a logical condition using the [and] slot to ensure that the value of [cloudlets.cluster] is equal to [clusters.id]. This is typically used in scenarios where you need to verify that two identifiers or values match, often in the context of database operations or data validation. The [and] slot is used to combine multiple conditions, and in this case, it ensures that the equality condition between [cloudlets.cluster] and [clusters.id] is met.
