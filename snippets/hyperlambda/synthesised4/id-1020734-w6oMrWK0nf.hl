/*
 * 1. `@.dp` - This iterator retrieves the first node with the name ".dp" in the current context. The "@" symbol indicates that it searches for a node by name.
 * 2. `#` - This iterator de-references the value of the node found by the previous iterator. It assumes that the value of the ".dp" node is another node, and it retrieves that node by reference.
 * 3. `*` - This iterator retrieves all children nodes of the node obtained from the previous iterator. It is used to explore the hierarchy further by accessing all direct descendants.
 * 4. `name` - This iterator filters the result set to include only nodes with the name "name". It narrows down the selection to nodes specifically named "name" among the children retrieved by the `*` iterator.
 * 
 * This expression is useful for navigating a hierarchical data structure to find specific nodes named "name" that are descendants of a node referenced by the ".dp" node. The use of the `#` iterator indicates that the ".dp" node's value is expected to be a reference to another node, allowing for dynamic data manipulation and retrieval.
