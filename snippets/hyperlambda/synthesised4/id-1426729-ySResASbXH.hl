/*
 * This Hyperlambda code returns a structured response containing three main nodes: [urls], [snippets], and [meta]. The [meta] node further contains a [main] node with an integer value of 0. The code is likely used to return a set of URLs, code snippets, and some metadata information, with the metadata specifically indicating a main value of zero. 
 * 
 * 1. [urls] - Represents a collection of URLs to be returned.
 * 2. [snippets] - Represents a collection of code snippets to be returned.
 * 3. [meta] - Contains metadata information about the response.
 * 4. [main] - An integer value within the [meta] node, set to 0, possibly indicating a default or initial state.
