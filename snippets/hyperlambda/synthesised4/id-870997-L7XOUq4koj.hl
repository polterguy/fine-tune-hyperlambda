// This Hyperlambda code snippet demonstrates how to insert a new record into the "ml_training_snippets" table using the [data.create] slot. It specifies the table name and provides values for the "prompt," "completion," and "type" fields, with the "type" field being dynamically retrieved from the [.arguments] node. The code ensures that the data is inserted safely, preventing SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries.
data.create
   table:ml_training_snippets
   values
      prompt:x:@.prompt
      completion:x:@.completion
      type:x:@.arguments/*/type
