.arguments

/*
 * Existing code here ...
 *
 * To declare an endpoint you have to have the above [.arguments] collection, and if you want
 * to wrap your existing Hyperlambda code into an endpoint, you need to add the above [.arguments]
 * node, optionally containing your arguments.
 *
 * If your [.arguments] collection is empty, like the above, this implies you have an HTTP web API
 * endpoint, but it takes ZERO parameters.
